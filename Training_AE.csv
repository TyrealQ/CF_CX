There is so much to do and see around and outside the stadium as well. The unconquered statue is a must see. The various other statues such as the seminole family and bobby bowden placed on the immediate outskirts of the stadium are nice pieces of FSU history to learn about.

This was NOT the stadium I remembered. Frankly, the stadium I remembered was not much to look at. Sure, we all had a ball going to games (even though, back in those days, we mostly lost); however, the stadium was pretty old and standard. THIS stadium is amazing! It's the stadium that Bobby Bowden built. I foresee another whole post about my awe and respect for Bobby Bowden, but I do not think I'm overstating that without him, Doak Campbell Stadium would never be as grand.There are wonderful statues around the exterior. The Bobby Bowden statue occupies a place of honor. Even more recognizable to the public (and deeply meaningful to those of us who went to school here) is the 'Unconquered' statue of Osceola on Renegade. During the day it is remarkable. At night, it's an amazing sight to behold!We walked around the entirety of the stadium and stopped to admire the statues that are outside. One depicts a family of Native American Seminoles. It's really beautiful. I love that my university never forgets who originally owned the land and who have graciously allowed us to use their tribal name. Another of the wonderful statues is 'Sportsmanship'. There was a mandatory stop to photograph our Championship Wall. Wish we'd gone into the 'sod cemetery', but that will have to wait until my next homecoming trip.Inside the stadium is the Hall of Fame. As you walk through the doors, the first thing one sees are the three National Championship trophies-three gleaming crystal footballs. There are also banners showing achievements of those associated with Florida State University in all college athletic programs. Most notably there was a banner highlighting Jameis Winston's Heisman Trophy award.One of the displays that really meant a whole lot to me was the case that discussed the legacy of Osceola and Renegade. In the case are Renegade #1's blanket and bridle along with Osceola??s boots. During my time at the University, that tradition had not yet started. I'm exceedingly glad that it's part of the fabric of FSU football and life now.As for watching a football game at Bobby Bowden Field at Doak S. Campbell Stadium, I truly believe that it is one of the best places in sports to see a game. There are no 'bad' seats. The fans are respectful and fun (of course, it was a home crowd). The scoreboards are easily seen from anywhere and the food and restroom facilities are clean and easily accessible. A great place to watch a great team.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""[ { '''Aspect_1''': '''stadium''', '''Details_1''': '''this stadium is amazing''' }, { '''Aspect_2''': '''Bobby Bowden''', '''Details_2''': '''the stadium that Bobby Bowden built''' }, { '''Aspect_3''': '''statues''', '''Details_3''': '''There are wonderful statues around the exterior''' }, { '''Aspect_4''': '''Bobby Bowden statue''', '''Details_4''': '''The Bobby Bowden statue occupies a place of honor''' }, { '''Aspect_5''': '''Osceola statue''', '''Details_5''': ''' 'Unconquered' statue of Osceola on Renegade''' }, { '''Aspect_6''': '''Native American Seminoles statue''', '''Details_6''': '''One depicts a family of Native American Seminoles''' }, { '''Aspect_7''': '''Sportsmanship statue''', '''Details_7''': '''another of the wonderful statues is 'Sportsmanship' ''' }, { '''Aspect_8''': '''Championship Wall''', '''Details_8''': '''There was a mandatory stop to photograph our Championship Wall''' }, { '''Aspect_9''': '''Hall of Fame''', '''Details_9''': '''inside the stadium is the Hall of Fame''' }, { '''Aspect_10''': '''National Championship trophies''', '''Details_10''': '''As you walk through the doors, the first thing one sees are the three National Championship trophies''' }, { '''Aspect_11''': '''banners''', '''Details_11''': '''There are also banners showing achievements of those associated with Florida State University in all college athletic programs''' }, { '''Aspect_12''': '''Jameis Winston's Heisman Trophy''', '''Details_12''': '''Most notably there was a banner highlighting Jameis Winston's Heisman Trophy award''' }, { '''Aspect_13''': '''legacy of Osceola and Renegade''', '''Details_13''': '''One of the displays that really meant a whole lot to me was the case that discussed the legacy of Osceola and Renegade''' }, { '''Aspect_14''': '''Renegade #1's blanket and bridle''', '''Details_14''': ''' In the case are Renegade #1's blanket and bridle along with Osceola's boots''' }, { '''Aspect_15''': '''recommendation''', '''Details_15''': '''I truly believe that it is one of the best places in sports to see a game''' }, { '''Aspect_16''': '''seating''', '''Details_16''': '''There are no 'bad' seats''' }, { '''Aspect_17''': '''fans''', '''Details_17''': '''The fans are respectful and fun (of course, it was a home crowd)''' }, { '''Aspect_18''': '''scoreboards''', '''Details_18''': '''The scoreboards are easily seen from anywhere' },{ 'Aspect_19''': '''facilities''', '''Details_19''': '''food and restroom facilities are clean and easily accessible''' }, { '''Aspect_20''': '''team''', '''Details_20''': '''a great place to watch a great team''' } ]""}]}"
