2,Date of experience: November 2018,10-Jan-19,ACC,Boston College,3,Dated,Alumni Stadium feels very dated when compared to other schools of its size and ranking. The bleachers feel tired and are very uncomfortable to sit in for long periods of time. Even the boxes offered are unimpressive and are simply indoor seats. Needs to be redone in the coming years.
15,Date of experience: October 2022,3-Oct-22,ACC,Clemson,5,Terrific night game at Death Valley~,"Clemson has upped their game, both on the field and for the fans that visit.  What an incredible game that was Saturday night against NC State.  Love the new jumbo tron!"
24,Date of experience: November 2019,3-Jan-20,ACC,Clemson,5,College football experience,Clemson is proud of their football heritage. The fans here are very energetic and faithful to their team. It was very great to see!
26,Date of experience: January 2019,11-Nov-19,ACC,Clemson,5,Great stadium.,I love the stadium because I like to watch the Clemson tigers play football here. This is a great venue to watch the Tigers play football.
28,Date of experience: November 2019,2-Nov-19,ACC,Clemson,5,Great place to watch a game,Great town who loves their football! Fun afternoon and very friendly people! We were in for a college tour and stayed to watch the game. We didn??t have a specific tailgate to go to but great food and drinks in town.
31,Date of experience: October 2019,15-Oct-19,ACC,Clemson,3,"Great Fans, Average Stadium","Make sure you go in the correct side as both sides are not connected. Traffic and parking are a nightmare, although the Clemson folks think the situation is far better than it used to be.  We had a parking pass for lot 25, arriving 3.5 hours prior to kickoff, and the lot was full.  Bottled water was only $2!  So were the hot dogs, but I've never had such a horrible tasting hot dog.  Nachos and pretzels are $5.  Beer is not sold in the stadium, but you can leave the stadium and return.  Tailgating is prevalent.  The fans were friendly (it helps when they are beating the snot out of the visiting team).  Hotels on football game days are very expensive."
32,Date of experience: August 2019,5-Oct-19,ACC,Clemson,3,"With Recent Success, Stadium Needs a Serious Makeover","We were in town for the Clemson/A&M game. It's an older venue, and needs a serious makeover as the entrance process is awful.  This may not be a problem with normal ACC games, but having a high profile game brings a much bigger crowd, which the crew could not handle in a timely manner. The stadium reminded me of old Kyle Field which smelled of bat guano and Memorial stadium had plenty of those smells.There were plenty of restrooms and concessions. Also lots of space on the concourse to hang out...which was taken advantage of due to the unrelenting sun and heat during the game. They also have a cooling station with misters for fans to cool off, which was needed. LOTS of steps if you were high up on the top deck, but easy to navigate with railing the entire way up. Great staff on hand to assist with any needs.I hope with Clemson's recent football success that they upgrade their facilities, and look at their entrance schemes as their current one is awful.  On a separate note, the staff that we dealt with at the student center setting up The Association of Former Students All-Aggie Tailgate was excellent."
35,Date of experience: September 2019,12-Sep-19,ACC,Clemson,5,This Texas Aggie Is A Fan,"I've been to road games far and wide, including marquee programs in Omaha, Miami, Norman, and Tuscaloosa.  Clemson, you are the best by a long shot (Kyle Field excluded of course).  It's all about the fans.  Before, during, and after the game, you were welcoming and engaging.  It's something that cannot be faked.  I am officially a fan.  Go Tigers!"
36,Date of experience: September 2019,10-Sep-19,ACC,Clemson,5,Class of 1969 with Class of 2036,What a fun visit.  The Rock.  The Hill.  The grand boys. So much  Life in Death Valley.visiting the day after Texas A&M with hardly anyone around.  Memorial Stadium is impressive empty.  Try it.  Go Tigers.
38,Date of experience: September 2019,10-Sep-19,ACC,Clemson,4,Iconic Stadium,"Attended the Clemson/A&M game last weekend. The stadium is old but very clean and lots of concession stands and restrooms .  While we had high level seats, loved walking up the ramps rather than steps.  Of course, the last level had steps leading up which  were rather steep but doable.  Everyone was very pleasant and welcoming, especially the fans.  Even losing the game, it was fun to be there and experience it."
41,Date of experience: October 2018,15-May-19,ACC,Clemson,5,"""It's a MASSIVE Arena for Clemson Football""",You'll see plenty of ORANGE and PURPLE here.  The massiveness of this stadium is often mind-boggling the higher-up you go...and it reverberates with CLEMSON PRIDE.
45,Date of experience: January 2019,6-Feb-19,ACC,Clemson,5,Home of the 2018 National Champion Clemson Tigers,"What can I say? A game at Memorial Stadium (Clemson's Death Valley) is something special that has to be experienced personally. The excitement is truly hard to describe. Being part of a crowd of 80,000 plus watching my Tigers play is one of the truly great experiences in life. As Clemson grads, my wife and I know this is a special place. Put it on your bucket list! Our most recent visit to Memorial Stadium was to celebrate Clemson's 2018 College Football National Championship with a stadium full of fans."
46,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Feb-19,ACC,Clemson,5,Unbeatable atmosphere,"Figured that as a football fan, I should attend a game for one of the best collegiate football teams in the country. It didn't disappoint, the fans and atmosphere were among the best I've ever experienced."
47,Date of experience: January 2019,19-Jan-19,ACC,Clemson,5,Championship celebration,We went for the National Championship celebration. It was an absolute amazing experience. The atmosphere was awesome.
48,Date of experience: September 2018,16-Jan-19,ACC,Clemson,5,Great Stadium,We were able to watch The Clemson TIGERS win several games this season.  The stadium is great and so are the fans.  The food and beverages are reasonable..in fact they are cheaper than any other stadium we went to this year.  They do not serve alcohol.  To me that is a good thing!
56,Date of experience: November 2018,7-Nov-18,ACC,Clemson,3,Interesting and Steep,We thought this would be much larger. I see why it is called Death Valley. It is really steep and seemed crowded.
57,Date of experience: November 2018,6-Nov-18,ACC,Clemson,5,Fun atmosphere!,"Even if you are not a Clemson fun, this place is a fun and family friendly atmosphere. The concession prices are fair! The pizza slice is $7 but it is a great size slice! I loved the tradition and Clemson crowd."
60,Date of experience: October 2018,22-Oct-18,ACC,Clemson,5,The best place to watch college football in the Country,"Friendly fans, modern accommodations, easy access and knowledgeable staff. Safe and family friendly."
61,Date of experience: September 2018,29-Sep-18,ACC,Clemson,2,Overrated,"Im not a fan of Clemson or Syracuse but i enjoy going to other teams stadiums and see other teams traditions. As a fan you always hear about Death Valley and decided to give it a try.  To start parking is so confusing and hard to find.  Zero signs and very little help with police or staff.  Ended up parking about two miles from the stadium which is quite a distance to walk.  No shuttles or rides were in site.  The area itself really can't handle the amount of people who attend this stadium.  I left early because i think the traffic would take about 6 hours to clear.  So after a long walk i get the stadium.  Security is non existent here and i got all the way to the ticket check and the girl said i need to go another gate for upper decks.  No signage anywhere telling you this and only about 10,000 people cramming into a tiny entrance.  Finally get to my seats, its a hike in the upper decks, i was row O and it barely was half way!  The view wasn't bad but for the price i expected better.  The fans are ok, i wouldn't say its the loudest, but they do love their Tigers.  The venue itself is extremely dated, i think i walked into 1970.  Restrooms are awful, the mens rooms takes you back to 1950.  Concession stands are high school level and payment is used on portable card readers.  Food was awful and close to worse i've ever gotten at a stadium.  The whole upper deck area has a very musty smell and looks like it hasn't ever been renovated.  Then another two mile walk to find my car in a muddy steep hill.  Overall i was very disappointed with my first experience with Death Valley."
62,Date of experience: September 2018,21-Sep-18,ACC,Clemson,5,Fantastic college football venue,We typically attend a couple of games a year here.  This is such an incredible place to see a college football game.  The fans are very passionate about their tigers and the stadium can get very loud especially for a key game or a night game especially.The food here is pretty good and fairly priced for stadium food.  There is no alcohol allowed in the stadium.
64,Date of experience: October 2017,6-Sep-18,ACC,Clemson,4,"Up, Up and Away","There really is not a bad seat in the house, but put on your walking shoes and don't get top deck tickets if you don't have stamina."
73,Date of experience: November 2017,18-Nov-17,ACC,Clemson,4,First Clemson game,"We were given free seats to the game! Bonus! Tiger fans are a blast!  There was definite great tailgating going on However, the stadium is at least a milefrom parking. I'm fine with that, hence the 4 stars. If you're not fit, don't like walking or are remotely disabled. Be prepared. There isn't a map to tell where the gates are at least not none that was visible. We missed the kick off because we were in the wrong gate line. Plan ahead. I would have had planned had I known  the gates weren't clearly marked/mappedWe were on the visitors side. Wow!  Steep stairs. I'm fairly fit but it was scary and it was a struggle. People were winded. There were no elevators to go that high. The bonus is that you can see everything from up there. The security team was very helpful finding our seats. Again, there were no signs.  Security was posted at every entrance to direct people. Overall, it's a decent stadium. But not for the physically challenged."
82,Date of experience: September 2017,17-Sep-17,ACC,Clemson,3,Decent stadium,"This is definitely one of those college stadiums that is dated.  The upper deck is way too steep... almost dangerous.  I would not recommend it for anyone who is older, overweight, or limited mobility."
86,Date of experience: November 2016,6-Sep-17,ACC,Clemson,4,Death Valley indeed,Great experience to see a game here. Seats are not cheap if you want to get good ones. The student sections are crazy as seat assignments mean nothing. Go Tigers!
92,Date of experience: September 2016,19-Jul-17,ACC,Clemson,4,Awesome experience,"Great to experience a Clemson game in the stadium.  Stadium itself is nothing special and it's annoying that those on top decks can't access the lower deck areas, but it's the Clemson football experience that makes it great."
99,Date of experience: October 2016,13-May-17,ACC,Clemson,5,Awesome football experience!,"We love going to football games at Death Valley.  Can't beat the atmosphere and the ""Most Exciting 25 seconds in College Football"" is not to be missed."
101,Date of experience: October 2016,6-May-17,ACC,Clemson,5,Game Day,Death Valley is the best stadium in the country to see a college football game. Great tailgating in a rural setting with great fans. The best feature is when the football team makes an entrance by running down a hill into the stadium. Stadium is open most non-game days for tours.
106,Date of experience: January 2017,7-Mar-17,ACC,Clemson,5,National Champions!!,Went to congratulate the national champs!! Clemson Tigers!! Great year and a great stadium to see a game!!
109,Date of experience: January 2017,15-Jan-17,ACC,Clemson,5,Best place ever,"I bleed orange!! There is nothing like being at Death Valley!! The friendliness, the feeling, the beauty!! I just can't explain it, you must experience it"
111,Date of experience: December 2016,4-Jan-17,ACC,Clemson,5,Great Stadium,"What a great place to watch a college football game.  Fans are super.  Arrive early and enjoy all the atmosphere and excitement.  Parking can be tough, but what sold out event doesn't have its issues.  If can get tickets, it is a great experience."
113,Date of experience: November 2016,30-Nov-16,ACC,Clemson,5,Awesome experience,"If you are able to buy tickets to see a Clemson Football game, it is well worth the money and the time. To be a witness of the synergy within the stadium is beyond words. If you weren't a fan, you will instantly become one and cheer those talented Tiger players all during the game. One of the best events to attend and if it isn't on your ""Bucket List"", it should be!"
114,Date of experience: November 2016,19-Nov-16,ACC,Clemson,5,GAMEDAY!,"You have to ask? It's CLEMSON --- it's the TIGERS on gameday! If you have never been, tickets will not be easy to get but it can be done - you must visit!"
115,Date of experience: November 2016,13-Nov-16,ACC,Clemson,3,Hi Cost / Low Value,"Must arrive 3 hours before game. Parking in the C1 lot takes a long time due to poor traffic control. $20 per car puts you far away from the stadium without a shuttle or any directions. At the end of the game, they do not let the lowly C1 parking lot guests out until the preferred parking lots have emptied. This could take 2 hours after the game. The preferred parking lots get the benefit of traffic control. Prepare to WAIT. The $60 seats are tiny. You will be pressed against someone during the game. It is a bench seat with no backrest. For $10, you can rent a stadium seat with a backrest - go tigers. They don't even clean the seats between games. Wipe it down yourself if you want it clean. The stadium food is expensive. Lots of people work this event and provide NO service. This explains the high cost of everything. Go tigers. SummaryFor two people who are not getting a CORPORATE / SALESMAN HANDOUT to attend the game. 2 x $60 per ticket = $120Parking = $202 x $10 per seat back = $20Water = $10Total = $170High cost with low value. Go Tigers! Better to watch on TV."
116,Date of experience: November 2016,12-Nov-16,ACC,Clemson,5,Best game day experience!,Nothing beats a game in Death Valley! Fun for everyone! High energy and loud...sets the stage for a great fan experience on game day!
118,Date of experience: October 2016,20-Oct-16,ACC,Clemson,4,Great place to watch College Football,"The overall game experience is very good - even when you are a fan of the visiting team. We are here every other year for the NC State vs Clemson game. Clemson fans are very into the game and win or lose they are very friendly. The stadium holds something like 81,000 with very steep stands. Luckily we were seated in the lower stands and didn't have to walk up a huge amount of steps at a very steep angle as did people in the upper stands. Concession stands need a bit of updating and expansion. I stood in line the entire halftime in order to get something to eat & drink. Over 20 min. If you are a visitor, it's a long walk from the nearest general parking lot. About 1.3 miles. up and down a few hills. Not bad if you are young but at 73 it hurt! But the Clemson fans will offer you a beer & something to eat as you pass by."
119,Date of experience: October 2016,18-Oct-16,ACC,Clemson,5,Homecoming Weekend - Overtime Win,My 1st time to a game in Death Valley and the college football experience.  The game went to overtime and a Tiger win so you couldn't ask for anything more exciting.  We were in the 3rd deck and very surprised how good the view was from up high.  After the game went to touch the Howard Rock.  Bucket list item checked :)
120,Date of experience: October 2016,17-Oct-16,ACC,Clemson,5,Classic college football stadium,"I have been to the Big House for Michigan/ Ohio State and to the horseshoe in Columbus, been to Notre Dame and several other colleges for game day but no one does it quite like Clemson. Was there for NC State game and the pagentry before the game with the band, team entrance, and then the game made my ticket price worth every penny. Gotta touch the rock. Watch Tiger walk in the pregame tailgate and shake hands with your favorite player. Listen to Dabo he s a gem. Met some guys who came on their bachelor' s party from Chicago because they heard it was a must see."
121,Date of experience: October 2016,17-Oct-16,ACC,Clemson,4,Great atmosphere for college football.,"We had nosebleed seats, but this is a great place to watch college football.  The atmosphere in the stadium was electric, and we were impressed that no one left early.  The food is just standard game food, but the place was clean and the people were friendly."
122,Date of experience: October 2016,17-Oct-16,ACC,Clemson,5,Best Stadium in the Country,This is the best Stadium in the country!  The excitement in the stadium can not be matched anywhere else!
123,Date of experience: October 2016,14-Oct-16,ACC,Clemson,5,Death Valley,If you are a Clemson fan you already know that this is where the Tigers play. If your not then you need to stop by and check it out.
124,Date of experience: October 2016,7-Oct-16,ACC,Clemson,3,Very intimidating to the visiting team.,The stadium is rough for someone out of shape!  A lot of ramps and steep steps in the upper deck.  Concession prices were outrageous and they don't sell beer.  Boooo!
125,Date of experience: October 2016,5-Oct-16,ACC,Clemson,5,Best football ever!,Fun friendly game day campus environment. Lots of school spirit and pride. Tailgating lots of fun; Hendrix parking lot great
126,Date of experience: September 2016,19-Sep-16,ACC,Clemson,5,The best stadium around!,THE Death Valley is an on campus venue with game day atmosphere as good or better than any place in the country. It features what is widely known as the most exciting entrance in all of football. We also have the best sports dive bar in the world across the street (The World Famous ESSO Club).
127,Date of experience: September 2016,18-Sep-16,ACC,Clemson,5,Best ever,Been to many games but this was the best ever. Clemson football is the best and going to a game is a must do for any football fan.
128,Date of experience: September 2016,18-Sep-16,ACC,Clemson,5,Cleanest Stadium in the South,From all the stadiums Ive been to this one is the cleanest. The feel here is very friendly. The people are real curtious. There are benches not seatbacks. Very spacious. Easy access- dasani was $1 best seal ever. From tailgating real easy to get in. If u had a bag youd need a clear one. Now parking is another issue-plan to walk alot and its hilly. Would do it again. The only other catch is the hotels raise there rates to $200 a night during this weekend.  Kid feiendly as well.
129,Date of experience: September 2016,18-Sep-16,ACC,Clemson,5,Clemson Football,"Awesome stadium, awesome fans!!!  Go Tigers!!!  Great experience at first Clemson game!  Bring sunscreen and a fan!  Opportunity to go on field after game and meet some players!  Tailgating before the game was second to none!"
130,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,ACC,Clemson,5,Clemson Football!!,This place rocks!  Love our Clemson Tigers.  The entrance to the stadium by the players is one of the best in the nation.  Awesome tailgating going on all over campus.  A must see if ever in the area.
132,Date of experience: September 2016,11-Sep-16,ACC,Clemson,4,Hard to afford thanks IPTAY,Not a Clemson fan at all but I love college football. Tickets have gone through the roof thanks to IPTAY. Not much here other then going to a football game. But we did enjoy going to see Clemson play Troy.
134,Date of experience: September 2015,3-Aug-16,ACC,Clemson,5,Love Clemson,Went back to see how Clemson had changed since going to school there in the early 80's. The town had grown but it was great to be back in Tiger Town!!
135,Date of experience: August 2016,2-Aug-16,ACC,Clemson,5,Go Tigers!~,"This is a small bowl in the ground, however its been known to reach 112db.  This sweet southern college town is such a treat to experience.  There is truly something about these hills at Clemson University."
137,Date of experience: October 2015,18-Jul-16,ACC,Clemson,5,It isn't the same as Beaver Stadium in State College ...,... but few places are. I have been to quite a few college footbal venues and this one is very nice.  Easy in and out and the crowd is great (again not in a class with Happy Valley) but still a great experience.
140,Date of experience: November 2015,17-Jun-16,ACC,Clemson,5,The BEST,A very impressive stadium with a terrific atmosphere. The fans are nice and helpful. Sit in the lower deck if possible!
142,Date of experience: November 2015,4-Jun-16,ACC,Clemson,5,The Best,"What can you say if you are a Clemson fan. Let me say this for visitors. You will not find a more exciting place to watch a college football game. You will find it easy to find parking, easy to get out and enjoyable while you are here. Family atmosphere and friendly environment."
143,Date of experience: October 2015,2-Jun-16,ACC,Clemson,5,Clemson football,I enjoyed watching Clemson win the football game. The organization of all the people was great - very little time to wait to leave after the game.
146,Date of experience: November 2015,10-May-16,ACC,Clemson,4,Like entering the coliseum,"Every time I go to a game at Death Valley I am awestruck by the size of the place (seats 83 thousand) and the marvelous condition of the place.  The games are loud, the fans fanatical, yet most are under control.  A true meaning of college football and all the finest things that go on during a match."
149,Date of experience: November 2015,21-Apr-16,ACC,Clemson,5,Clemson Football,This is the best football atmosphere  anywhere. There are always thousands and thousands of tailgaters. Very vocal crowd but they are very friendly and hospital. The crowd is the 12Th. man on the field.Great to visit as a fan but not good for the visiting team on the field. It is very noisy.
151,Date of experience: September 2015,8-Apr-16,ACC,Clemson,5,Best College Stadium in the Country!,"I'm a little biased, since I graduated from Clemson, but I love Memorial Stadium!  I was able to attend several games there last year and hope to attend several this coming season.  Even took my son there for his first football game this past season!  Go Tigers!"
153,Date of experience: September 2015,15-Mar-16,ACC,Clemson,5,Football,There is no place on earth that is better than Memorial Stadium for football.  The atmosphere is electric.  We bought session tickets for 2016!
154,Date of experience: September 2015,10-Mar-16,ACC,Clemson,5,A MUST,must go to this during a football game!players running down the hill is just.. awesome!very packed during football season.tailgating EVERYWHERE!!beautiful campus.
155,Date of experience: October 2015,1-Mar-16,ACC,Clemson,5,"Great stadium, great game","We went to see a Clemson football game and were not disappointed. The stadium is huge, saw a great game. Will definitely be back next season for more football. Everyone was friendly. Trying to park was the only problem, get there early."
156,Date of experience: November 2015,1-Mar-16,ACC,Clemson,4,The time of your life,"Memorial Stadium, otherwise known as Death Valley to those who have walked the hallowed halls of Clemson University (and those who have fallen to the mighty Tigers), is an evolving masterpiece.  Many of the reviews talk about the food and the traffic, but that is not really what defines this stadium.  The University has built on to this stadium, and I'll admit that the upper deck is a pretty scary place to be!  But if you are fortunate enough to be in the lower deck, preferably seated under the overhang of the upper deck, you can really watch some football.  The view from the boxes is even better ... if you can get that!  The ""home"" side, otherwise known as the South stands, used to have a fantastic view of the lake, and on a clear day you could even see some mountains. Now that the West End Zone has been enclosed, not so much, but Death Valley is surely a pretty stadium and the football here has been first-rate for the last several years."
157,Date of experience: November 2015,13-Feb-16,ACC,Clemson,5,Most exciting 25 seconds in college football,"Voted loudest stadium, best tailgating, best in ACC. 82500 fans in the stadium and another 40000 tailgating around the stadium. Great fans. Inviting. Running down the hill a great tradition meeting at the paw on the field after the game another."
161,Date of experience: October 2015,31-Jan-16,ACC,Clemson,5,LOVE THIS PLACE,"OMG... I didn't even LIKE football until I went to my first Clemson Football game. The fans here are the nicest, and the school spirit is absolutely contagious.  WOW!!!!"
162,Date of experience: August 2015,25-Jan-16,ACC,Clemson,5,Best College Football Stadium!!,"This stadium is incredibly unique! The combination of the crowd, environment, hospitality, excitement, traditions, and orange is indescribable. Clemson fans are truly the kindest and the weather is usually great. If you can't go to a football, it's worth seeing at least!"
163,Date of experience: October 2015,30-Dec-15,ACC,Clemson,5,Not New England College Football,"I when to the BC-Clemson game. Death Valley is far different than Alumni Stadium. It's a tailgate experience and game like no other. There's not much in Clemson, but what there is revolves around Clemson football. It was a very cool experience."
164,Date of experience: December 2015,23-Dec-15,ACC,Clemson,5,Photo day with the ACC trophy and the Rock,"The sun was shining, cover off the rock, ACC trophy front and center for photographs - very memorable day.  Its a beautiful stadium - apparently fans have to pay extra for seats with backs - seats are not too steep, symmetrical seating, nice view of the university.  Memorable day -"
165,Date of experience: November 2015,16-Dec-15,ACC,Clemson,5,Amazing game.,Must have tickets bought in advance; otherwise pay extra from people selling in street. Extraordinary experience.
166,Date of experience: November 2015,15-Dec-15,ACC,Clemson,5,The Best Collegiate Football Experience Ever,"The Stadium itself might not be state of the art, but the atmosphere and fans are first class.  Tailgating around the stadium is like none other."
167,Date of experience: October 2015,14-Dec-15,ACC,Clemson,5,As good as it gets on Saturdays,"Clemson Memorial Stadium is the greatest place  to watch a college football game. The atmosphere is great, the crowd is insane, the noise level is through the roof, and right now they're the #1 team in the nation."
168,Date of experience: November 2015,23-Nov-15,ACC,Clemson,4,"Great atmosphere & place to tailgate, don't enter the stadium hungry","Great atmosphere to see a football game, nice fans and a tremendous amount of tailgating.  We are from out of state & on a college visit, so we ate downtown then headed to the stadium.  It was an easy walk, don't expect to park near the stadium unless you plan in advance or arrive early.Only complaint is stadium food, choices not great, prices were similar to ""Yankee Stadium"" prices, $4 for bottled water, $6 or more for sodas.  Food choices were not great, hot dogs/corn dogs/nachos/pretzels/pizza and were not cheap.  No beer in the stadium (typical for a college game), many fans left at halftime to continue their tailgating."
169,Date of experience: November 2015,22-Nov-15,ACC,Clemson,5,A great college football venue,"What a great place to watch some college football.  The teams entrance into the stadium is one of the best.  There are no bad seats, and the Clemson fans are awesone.  One suggestion though is that food vendors start accepting debit cards."
170,Date of experience: October 2015,20-Nov-15,ACC,Clemson,5,Best college game day experience ever!,"Nothing like watching my Tigers play in Death Valley, even in the rain!! From tailgating to running down the hill!"
171,Date of experience: October 2015,18-Nov-15,ACC,Clemson,5,The real Death Valley!!,I have been to numerous football games around the country and nothing is like a game in Death Valley. The fans are wonderful and there's really no 'bad' seats. It is a wonderful experience even if you are not a tiger fan.
172,Date of experience: November 2015,8-Nov-15,ACC,Clemson,3,"Great place, traffic sucks",We came down for a football game and tailgating. They closed the 2 tailgating area due to it being too wet and had no other accommodation set. So paid $350 for a spot and got no parking. Took 4 hours to get and find a spot. The game was great stadium is awesome but they have not accommodations for this many people or how to handle traffic. When the game was over it took 3 1/2 hours before we actually got out of the parking lot. Worse place I have ever been for traffic. If you have no plans or time is not an issue visit this place when there is no game.

175,Date of experience: October 2015,29-Oct-15,ACC,Clemson,5,Buckit list quality experience for college football fans,"Espoused to be the most exciting 25 seconds in College football the entrance of the Clemson football team leaving the buses, rubbing the rock and running down the hill into the first Death valley of 82,500 in the stadium and just maybe an equal number outside tail gating is something to experience. Welcoming Clemson fans over hundreds of acres of parking lots tail gating, cooking everything imaginable form grill to grill. Best seats south stands lower level behind the team. Most comfortable the new WEZ west endzone with food served before and at half time covered and air conditioned. Best lot to tailgate Lot 5 or the Motor Home lot behind the baseball stadium. Visitor parking sucks so purchase a parking space. Stub hub or Tigernet.com. Winner of loudest stadium and best college venue. Clemson keeps investing and improving every year. Come to wear the Blue Ridge Yawn their greatness. Where the Tigers play"
176,Date of experience: October 2015,26-Oct-15,ACC,Clemson,5,No other place like it!!,This is the best stadium in the world for football.  No place like Death Valley in Clemson.  No place like Clemson fans. No other tailgate experience even comes close!
177,Date of experience: October 2015,24-Oct-15,ACC,Clemson,5,Awesome experience!!!!!,Our seats were way up high in corner and yet I thought the view was amazing. It rained the entire time but it managed to take nothing away from the moment.  First time visit and I thought it was soooo cool. Loved seeing Clemson run down the hill.  The loss was crushing to my Irish and I hated to lose but still glad I went. After the game my brother and I went down on the field. So incredible. Then we got to touch Howard's Rock! We were probably the last two to do it bc the guy was yelling at us to get away. Oops!   Best part of Clemson are the amazing kind people from there. They welcomed us like I've never seen. Nicest people ever.  I'm now a fan and I hope they go on to win the national championship. (Since my Irish won't!)

179,Date of experience: October 2015,19-Oct-15,ACC,Clemson,4,Must for Clemson Football fans,"The stadium is enormous, and most of the seats have a good view.  The first few rows in the corners of the North/South stands are at a weird angle, though.  And I don't recommend the Top Deck to those with heart conditions or vertigo, because the steps are very steep, and there are a lot of them.  And as others have said, plan to walk to the stadium--there is a shuttle for those with disabilities--and traffic on the way out requires lots of patience."

181,Date of experience: October 2015,18-Oct-15,ACC,Clemson,5,"Small town, big stadium, huge fans",We went for the homecoming game against Boston College. Stadium was pretty full and impressively orange! Very good view from lower deck and show on the field during down times. Traffic fairly congested on the way out.
182,Date of experience: October 2015,18-Oct-15,ACC,Clemson,5,Electrifying!!,I love my Clemson Tigers.  Memorial Stadium is always so much fun. It is easy to get to and the facility is always clean. The staff is always very friendly.
183,Date of experience: November 2014,15-Oct-15,ACC,Clemson,5,Away Fan,"I absolutely loved my experience at Memorial Stadium. It was clean, extremely family friendly-- they had a stroller check in area! The stadium itself is kind of small in comparison to others I've visited, but the traditions are great. Fans were polite, security was plentiful. I would love to go back as an away visitor."

185,Date of experience: October 2015,11-Oct-15,ACC,Clemson,2,Clemson vs. Georgia Tech football,"My wife and I went to the game football Saturday at Clemson in the rain and watched a really good Clemson team beat GT.  The stadium is nice but the traffic and the way it is directed is as bad as any stadium I have ever been to, gotta be a better plan than the one they are using, especially the closer you get to the stadium, it is poorly done. Once we arrived we really had no idea where our seats were since there is no diagram on the ticket, so we showed 3 people our tickets that were working for the university, one was at the information desk on the north east corner of the stadium, asking each where we were supposed to go and all three sent us to a gate, halfway down the stadium with an elevator on our right; when we showed her our ticket she said we were on the wrong side of the stadium, so we had to walk half way around the stadium to the correct elevator. This is really not acceptable and placed a sour taste in our mouths about incompetence of the support staff working on game day at Memorial Stadium. Fortunately, these are problems that can be solved and hopefully they will.  The game and atmosphere was good and the Tigers took care of business, bottom line."
186,Date of experience: October 2015,4-Oct-15,ACC,Clemson,5,College Football Mecca,"Went to an epic game between Clemson and Notre Dame.  It was under the lights and it was off the charts. The decibel levels stayed above 100 most if the game with 80k fans at full throat. Memorial Stadium in Death Valley reminds me of a Roman Coliseum...very intimidating to any opponent.  The facilities were basic and it was apparent to me that all the focus is on football without the frills. I am amazed how well the field held up through the crazy amount of rain we had. The only issue I had was with parking.  Our general lot C1 was a mile away from the stadium with no retun shuttle, it cost $20 to park there and it took an entire hour to be allowed out of the lot by the state troopers directing traffic. I will definitely be back to see another game and enjoy the awesome tailgating. Go Tigers!"
187,Date of experience: September 2015,29-Sep-15,ACC,Clemson,5,Best Stadium in the country,GO TIGERS!!! this is where you can watch the football team play. really an experience you should not miss.

189,Date of experience: September 2015,22-Sep-15,ACC,Clemson,5,Awesome experience,"We have been to ""Death Valley"" many times, but had never reviewed for TripAdvisor. This stadium is unbelievable, with the noise level hard to imagine. The spirit here is unsurpassed at any collegiate venue anywhere!!! We look forward to each Clemson home game."
190,Date of experience: September 2015,17-Sep-15,ACC,Clemson,5,I can't believe the size of this stadium,This stadium is massive! I would love to come here for a football game.  Loved driving around the campus

193,Date of experience: September 2015,7-Sep-15,ACC,Clemson,5,Fantastic college football atmosphere,For anyone who loves college football Clemson is a fantastic place to see a game.  The fans are great even to the opposing team.  When the players run down on to the field the place just goes crazy.
194,Date of experience: September 2015,5-Sep-15,ACC,Clemson,5,Home,"Lucky to get to experience this venue year after year. Top rate facility with unmatched views of campus, Blue Ridge Mountains, and Hartwell Lake."

197,Date of experience: October 2014,10-Aug-15,ACC,Clemson,5,Must experience for Football Fanatics,"If College Football is your thing then Death Valley is a must see.  Be prepared to come early and stay late as the Tailgating is always at the top of the list.  Southern hospitality at its finest, unless you are wearing the colors of the opposing team."
198,Date of experience: November 2014,28-Jul-15,ACC,Clemson,5,Best College Football Stadiums,"As a graduate of Clemson University, I might be a tad biased, but I will say that I have been to many stadiums (pro & college) and when the Tigers run down the hill...there is nothing else like it in sports!"
199,Date of experience: November 2014,26-Jul-15,ACC,Clemson,5,Saturdays in the Park,"The atmosphere can be electric during the fall.  When the Tigers are doing well, the place is alive.  Lots of strong traditions, camaraderie, and even if you're a visitor, the home folks try to help out."
200,Date of experience: October 2014,23-Jul-15,ACC,Clemson,5,Awesome place to spend a fall Saturday afternoon.,"Over the years, I have been to Memorial Stadium many times.  The energy and atmosphere are both awesome.  Tailgating before, during and after the game always gives us a chance to catch up with friends we haven't seen in a while and watching the most exciting 25 seconds in college football is always a very cool experience."
202,Date of experience: October 2014,4-Jun-15,ACC,Clemson,5,What's not to LOVE?,"This stadium is just incredible. When I came to Clemson, I was not a football fan, but after my first game, I will forever be a Tiger. This stadium gives me goosebumps at every single game. I even love walking by in the summer, when all the students are gone. It's just a wonderful stadium full of history and memories. A Clemson game is NEVER forgotten and forever in your heart."
204,Date of experience: August 2014,15-Apr-15,ACC,Clemson,5,AMAZING CITY,Clemson is an amazing and beautiful city to study. Every student is nice and implicated in Clemson's spirit. The Memorial Stadium is really impressive and is definitely a place to visit during football game when the atmosphere is at its best !
205,Date of experience: October 2014,13-Feb-15,ACC,Clemson,5,Outstanding place to watch football,"Memorial Stadium epitomizes College Football. Beautiful, large (seating just under 82,000), full of screaming Tiger fans, very hot most of the time. At the same time, Clemson fans are for the most part friendly to visiting school fans. Some schools are not very welcome. However being NC State fans we have always been treated very well. Before & after the game we have been always offered something to drink and eat. Clemson & NC State are the same type of school. Land Grant, STEM oriented. Tailgating is always fun at Clemson. A lot of the parking spots are a good distance away from the Stadium itself as you might expect with it being o campus. The spots right around the Stadium are reserved for Clemson season ticket holders. If you are a visitor you may have to walk as much as 2 miles to get to the Stadium. There are a lot of concession stands & bathrooms which are always clean. One problem is the steep climb in the upper decks. If you are seated towards the top is is a long way up and there is no easy way to get there. Clemson is one of the few schools that actually invites fans to come on the field after a game and just mingle. Wish more schools did this."
207,Date of experience: November 2014,8-Jan-15,ACC,Clemson,5,Now This is College Football - Go to a Game,"The true college football atmosphere. More people tailgate than can fit in the stadium, everyone is friendly, and the upper deck has the best views for the game. If you want the true experience get tickets in the lower deck row L or closer. It's loud, it's hot, and it's Clemson football with 86,000 of your closest friends. Clemson does football right."
208,Date of experience: November 2014,1-Dec-14,ACC,Clemson,5,"Great Venue to watch the Tigers, Friendly Great Seats, Patriotic","First time to watch a game in Death Valley-Great seats on the visitors side [in November]. If you love America this is a fantastic venue. Started off with God Bless America, The Pledge of Allegiance, and the Star Spangled Banner. Everyone stands for the kickoff and most of the game. It is college football at its finest. And to boot final score Clemson 35 South Carolina 17!"
216,Date of experience: October 2014,9-Oct-14,ACC,Clemson,2,stadium food,I'm sorry to say that as a Clemson fan I'm embarrassed when fans from out of town come to visit our stadium vendors..we really need to work on serving some better foods for the price we pay!! Go Tigers
218,Date of experience: September 2014,29-Sep-14,ACC,Clemson,5,Clemson Fan for Life as a result of this stadium!,"What an experience!  Even if you never went to Clemson, GO to a game here!  It is rich with history and tradition!  The tailgate is such a cool spectacle for any sports fans and there is not a bad seat in the house.  True, the Upper Deck seats are high, but they are perfect position to watch the Tigers arrive in the bus and run down ""THE HILL""!!  Go Tigers!!"
220,Date of experience: October 2013,1-Aug-14,ACC,Clemson,5,Great Fans,"Made the trip for the first time and the atmosphere was awesome! Upper deck seats are intimidating due to how high, but the field view was good and as soon as the players entered the top of the hill, you forget all about it. The fans were very welcoming (Clemson wins many awards for friendliest fans), several dozen made a point to say hello when they saw my visiting team colors. Had no negative interactions. A definite return trip is planned."
223,Date of experience: October 2013,28-May-14,ACC,Clemson,5,Football heaven,"Having been to football games all over the south, there is no better place to experience a true southern tailgate and competition with passion, cheering, mascots, a beautiful campus and more. The entire town is pumped for the game! Orange envelops the upper part of the state of SC and although I went to a rival university I have to respect the pride and love the fans as the stadium roars for the Tigers."
225,Date of experience: October 2013,19-Mar-14,ACC,Clemson,4,Better than average,It was better than I expected. Went for a Clemson game where I had no rooting interest but got caught up in the atmosphere.
227,Date of experience: August 2013,30-Jan-14,ACC,Clemson,5,"You've Experienced Nothing Like It, Until You Go!","With a husband and a a son who's graduated from Clemson, including a son who's there now, you can only imagine how many football games we've been to.  We hold seasons tickets and look forward to game days.  The stadium is beautiful with their new addition a few years back.  Large, loud and lively to say the least.  When you leave, even if you're not a Tiger fan, you'll walk away knowing what all the hype's about when people speak of Death Valley at Clemson University.  Seeing the Tigers run down the hill in person, with all of them touching Howard's rock, is nothing like watching it on TV.  The roar of the crowd is just incredible.  And of course, let's not forget a stadium that's dressed in orange."
228,Date of experience: September 2013,29-Jan-14,ACC,Clemson,5,BEST college football experience ever!!,"First, I must say that I'm a Tar Heel born and bred, graduated from UNC and have worked there ever since I graduated.  I have a colleague who is a Clemson alum and loves Clemson as much as I love UNC.  We took an extended weekend and squeezed in two games: UNC at South Carolina and then UGA at Clemson.  I've never attended a game at Clemson before and was thrilled that my first game would be such a big game as that against UGA, especially since it was ESPN College GameDay. I can honestly say that the Clemson fans are among the nicest in college football.  The football team's entrance has to be the greatest in all of college football.  I love how they film their trip from the locker room, loading the bus, driving to the other side of the stadium.  It's incredible.  Seriously, if I didn't already bleed Carolina blue, I would have to be a Clemson fan.  I have never experienced such a thrilling game from beginning to end.  Our seats were on the upper level, but it felt like we were just as much a part of the game as if we had sat on the lower level.  The whole place is crazy during a game!  I could feel the stadium shaking underneath me.  The only thing I don't like about the stadium is that you are only permitted to access the level for which you have a ticket.  Being that our tickets were upper-level, we couldn't access the lower level to rush the field after Clemson beat UGA, which was disappointing.  Also, you're allowed to leave the stadium during halftime and be granted reentry when you're ready to return, which I was a little leery of for safety reasons.  I think reentry shouldn't be an option as in most stadiums.  Overall, seeing a game here is a must for any college football fan.  It will be an experience you never forget!"
229,Date of experience: October 2013,8-Jan-14,ACC,Clemson,5,Loud and Lively!,"Great place for football!  The team buses arriving at the hill, Howard's Rock, the run down the hill, the balloons!  The tiger fans are really great and make a lot of noise."
231,Date of experience: November 2013,14-Dec-13,ACC,Clemson,5,Greatest Game Atmosphere!,"Love the feel, the noise, the orange and purple, and the TIGERS! There is no place like Death Valley!!"
234,Date of experience: October 2013,18-Nov-13,ACC,Clemson,5,Death Valley,Electric atmosphere as long as the Tigers are winning. I have seen two games there and one has been electric start to finish (a tiger win) and the other resulted in fans leaving at the start of the third quarter. They allow fans on the field after the games and that is a great experience because not many places will allow you to do that. You may alost get a chance to touch the famous Howard's Rock.
235,Date of experience: October 2013,6-Nov-13,ACC,Clemson,5,Great Place and Tradition,"Dabo Swinney said it best, if you love college football you need to come to the original death valley one time for a football game.  Great tailgating, beautiful campus, great game day traditions and the fans are passionate about there football."
237,Date of experience: October 2013,21-Oct-13,ACC,Clemson,5,Amazing stadium at the friendliest campus,No way not to get excited when they run the hill and the balloons take off.  Tailgating here is an all day affair and loads of fun.  If you love college football - this is a stadium not to be missed.  Try and get a lower level seat and it is pretty steep in the upper deck - although all of the seats give you a great view of the field.
239,Date of experience: October 2013,14-Oct-13,ACC,Clemson,5,Tigers Roar,I have been to many college stadiums across the Country and this is one of the best. It is sold out for every home game and the fans are fanatical. That being said they will share tailgating with everyone including opponent fans. There are no bad seats but parking can be a headache. I suggest parking at Hendrix Student Center and taking the shuttle bus to the stadium. The team entry after touching Howard's Rock is considered the most exciting 20 seconds in sports.
240,Date of experience: October 2013,12-Oct-13,ACC,Clemson,5,GO TIGERS!!!  CLEMSON IS A MUST SEE!!!,"The traditions at a Clemson football game are second to none.  The Tiger Walk, Running Down the Hill, Tailgating, The Tiger Tailgate Show to shopping drinking and dining downtown....A GREAT place to experience College Football at it's best.  Get to there early & tailgate...a unique experience.  Above all wear your Orange....GO TIGERS...."
241,Date of experience: October 2013,9-Oct-13,ACC,Clemson,5,Best Atmosphere in College Football,Don't miss tiger walk at frontage road behind stadium west end. Happens about 2 hours before kickoff. The run down the hill IS the best entrance in college football. Tailgating traditions vary family to family but would impress any college football fan.
243,Date of experience: August 2013,30-Sep-13,ACC,Clemson,3,Loved it but its no Sanford Stadium :),"Came here for the preseason game against Georgia. Facilities were nice, bathroom cleanliness and concessions weight times was as expected with a large sporting event. Only problem was the ATM actually ran out of money before halftime! Other than the fact that we lost -__- the seating was decent and parking was actually ok for us (we snagged a pass)."
245,Date of experience: August 2013,3-Sep-13,ACC,Clemson,5,Must see college football experience!,"As witnessed on national tv Saturday night for the Clemson-Georgia match up, Clemson is definitely a place you should visit. Get there early and enjoy the tailgaiting experience as well. Clemson's Memorial Stadium, a.k.a. ""Death Valley"" , is one of the top college football experiences in the nation and one that you must see in person to be able to fully appreciate it."
250,Date of experience: October 2012,18-Jan-13,ACC,Clemson,5,One of the top places to see a college football game in the country,"Having been to dozens of college stadiums, this one is at the top.

Amazing atmosphere on college football game days matched by no other school! The fans are cordial to one another. Just prior to the game when the players and coach staff run down ""The Hill"" is a sight to see. Lots of great tailgating all around the stadium."
256,Date of experience: October 2012,23-Oct-12,ACC,Clemson,5,The One and Only,"I've been attending football games in Death valley for nearly 40 years.  It's always a thrill to see the Tigers run down the hill at the start of a game.  Great tailgating and friendly fans, too."

261,Date of experience: November 2011,16-Jul-12,ACC,Clemson,2,Useful about Seven Days per Year,"I guess if you're going to a football game, this is the place to be--after all, it's the only choice.But as a destination, it's just a huge football stadium.  So far as I know, except for special occasions, you can't just walk in and explore, so I would not give this a high rating in terms of ""places to go and things to do in Clemson"" (except, of course, if you're a football fan and the team is at home and you have a ticket).  The other 358 days of the year, it is just a road block. :)I think the high ratings given this place should be under an attraction named ""Clemson Football Games.""So, from that angle, I'll give it a rating based on the one game we attended last year.  It was very hot.  It is very difficult to get way up to the upper deck seats (with 6 and 8 year-old kids).  Food is, as expected, poor and overpriced.  Much better to just check out the box score in the paper the next day."
264,Date of experience: November 2011,30-May-12,ACC,Clemson,5,Greatest College Football Venue,"Clemson's Death Valley is the greatest college football venue in the nation. The traditions are second to none. From the famed Tiger Paw to Running Down the Hill (the most exciting 25 seconds in college football), you will be entertained as you cheer on the Tigers.  The stadium is clean and newly renovated.  The setting is beautiful as the stadium overlooks Lake Hartwell.  Tailgating is awesome before and after the game and during halftime."
266,Date of experience: September 2011,11-May-12,ACC,Clemson,4,Death Valley,"Memorial Stadium;Otherwise known to the Clemson faithful..Death Valley. 99% of the time its used in the fall to accomidate the local university's (Clemson) football games. Its located about 30 miles from Greenville SC, and about 120 miles from Atlanta Ga. While it does mostly host the Clemson football games,it has also seen other events such as pep rallies and concerts.Parking can be very caotic. Most parking lots are wide spread and can be somewhat costly.The stadium seats about 80,000 and most seats are bleacher style,so bring a cushion. Food,drinks etc are also very expensive as well. The stadium consists of 4 major areas- West,East,North and South...the west is the newly contructed side (opposite of the hill) East is the hill...North is the visitor side and the south is the homebound Tigers's side.Once you get inside the stadium,it can be abit of a walk back to your car as I stated above.There really aren't any restraunts within walking distance, so eat before U come.2012 home games consist of...-Sept 8th- Ball St.-Sept 15th- Furman-Oct 6th- Ga tech-Oct 20th- Va tech-Nov 10th- Maryland-Nov 17- Nc State-Nov 24th- S.

276,Date of experience: September 2023,yesterday,ACC,Duke,5,Wallace Wade Stadium,Awesome little stadium. Can??t say I enjoyed the outcome of the game I was at. But the stadium was great. Yes you can purchase Beer if you are 21. Easy entry and exit. Prices were definitely in line with other stadiums that I have visited. Polite staff.
277,Date of experience: October 2022,2-Apr-23,ACC,Duke,5,Duke Blue Devils Get it Done,"Living in South Carolina I've decided I will attend at least 1 home game at every college football stadium.  This was number 5 on the list behind South Carolina,  NC State,  Clemson and  the Citadel.  The campus of Duke is absolutely beautiful and full of amazing architecture.  The football stadium is right next to the other sports fields and Basketball Arena.  Great layout. Small stadium but very enjoyable for football.  Every seat is an awesome view. They really put on a good pre game show and the staff was super cool. Tailgating was a bit different here than I'm use to at other schools.  A much smaller tailgate experience and more controlled by the school.  Plenty of things to see and do when visiting this stadium."

Very nice venue, excellent concession area, wait times were short.  Nice to see the school involve local charities in concessions for fund raising. In-and-out was easy.  40,004 capacity makes for a cozy atmosphere, Duke fans are enthusiastic yet welcoming of visitors."
286,Date of experience: December 2018,16-Dec-18,ACC,Duke,5,Love this stadium!,"This was my first visit to the stadium,  we attended the 4A HS Football Championship. I was very impressed!  No problem with parking, not a bad seat in the place, facilities were clean & attended."
287,Date of experience: November 2018,14-Dec-18,ACC,Duke,5,Good times!,"I went to Duke VT game 31-14 Vt.  I went to Duke UNC and Duke won 42-35!  Nice folks, good food and loud!  Will go again next season!"
288,Date of experience: October 2018,14-Nov-18,ACC,Duke,5,Awesome place to see a football game.,"My family and I having been going to Duke Football games for years.  While the team was beyond bad for years, Coach ""Cut"" has created a winner and Duke is now a competitive and winning program.  The venue has gone through major much needed upgrades in the paste few years.  Restrooms, concessions, field and stadium upgrades have all contributed to a better environment.  Tickets are reasonably priced and parking is free.  Tailgating is strongly recommended in the non-garage parking areas.  Duke has a relatively small student body, which allows for a smaller more personable experience.  Fans are well behaved and even opposing fans are treated with respect.  Go and enjoy."
289,Date of experience: November 2018,12-Nov-18,ACC,Duke,5,Great Football Venue,We were here for the Duke-Carolina Game.   The renovations are well done.  The seats are comfortable. The bathrooms were heated.  Woohoo. Concessions were varied and affordable.  The hot chocolate was tepid.  ??  Everyone was nice and it was a great game. No bags are allowed for security reasons. Parking was free but be prepared for a 20 minute walk.  Don't miss the bookstore- school apparel store.  And take time to visit Duke Chapel.
290,Date of experience: August 2018,25-Sep-18,ACC,Duke,5,Great combination of history and renovation,"No bad seats in the house, as Wallace Wade is not a big stadium.  They did a nice job of retrofitting the suites. Bring your sunglasses and a hat if the sun is going to be out."
292,Date of experience: November 2017,11-Aug-18,ACC,Duke,2,Duke football is back!,"Now that coach Cutcliff has Duke winning again, the fans have driven the crickets out of the stadium. Duke has spent a lot of money renovating the stadium and the did a fine job. The only thing I do not like about Duke football and it's the NCAA's fault, they blast music over the loudspeakers. Annoying music. It's like they think football cannot stand on it's own as entertainment in today's society. They seem to think that fans today need to be constantly bombarded with noise to have a good time. I like football. I like to study the game, watch the linemen, the running backs the defenses and offenses. I do not want to have to listen to all that crummy music. They literally play it until the ball is snapped!!!! I wish they would cancel the music and get back to good old football and let the school bands play they music."
293,Date of experience: September 2017,7-Feb-18,ACC,Duke,5,Lot of History,"Not the largest stadium in the conference has a lot of character. Parking is priemium as most college games. Named for one of Duke's most succesful coaches. The 1938 Iron Dukes are one of only three college teams to go undeated, untied and unscored upon during the regular season."
295,Date of experience: October 2017,17-Oct-17,ACC,Duke,5,Very nice amenities,The new renovations really make this stadium a great place to visit for a football game. There are a lot of food options as well.
296,Date of experience: October 2017,2-Oct-17,ACC,Duke,4,Good place to watch the game,My wife and I recently went to a game here as fans of the away team. The people were all good to us and the stadium really was quite nice if not terribly modern. From our seats it looked like there weren't any spots without a good view of the field.Our biggest issue was with leaving. It doesn't appear there is a preferred lot for taxi or Uber so it was a mess trying to get picked up after the game. We probably waited 40 minutes for our ride and 90 percent of Duke fans left well before the game was over. I can't imagine what a packed crowd would look like.
299,Date of experience: October 2016,26-Dec-16,ACC,Duke,2,Duke hasn't kept up with peers,Took in a game here and was surprised a the lack of amenities.  Food trucks and port a potties!  With such a highly endowed school I was shocked how it compared with other ACC venues.
300,Date of experience: November 2016,22-Nov-16,ACC,Duke,5,Quintessential college football!,Visited Duke to see Virginia Tech play and got two rewards!  Tech won! And we got to be in Wallace Wade Stadium to witness it!  Security was tightest of any (including all major league) sporting event we have ever seen but was efficiently run. Stadium is great size to view play from any area. Bathrooms were large and nice. #GoHokies!
302,Date of experience: October 2016,3-Oct-16,ACC,Duke,4,Footbal UVA vs Duke,"Very nice and good seating. Very strict on entering. Had to go thru all kinds of security. No package larger than 10"". Ladies leave your purses home. Parking is very far away about 1.5 miles. But nice walk thru campus. I will return. BTW UVA won the game....we traveled from Charlottesville."
303,Date of experience: October 2015,23-Dec-15,ACC,Duke,4,Great game day experience,"I decided to take the family here for a college football game.  It was our first, on Halloween and the stadium was a great experience.  The food was very good, although slightly expensive.  The seats were a little firm, bring a cushion.  Overall a great place to see a game, and the ticket packages were really good and affordable."
306,Date of experience: September 2015,25-Sep-15,ACC,Duke,4,Great place to see a college game and rennovation is great,Just went this past weekend to see Duke play.  The recent rennovations to Wallace Wade are great.  I love the actual seats versus the bleacher seats.  The new scoreboard and sound system is incredible.  The crowd has really started to get behind the football team and it is great to see the enthusiasm that only used to be a part of Duke basketball brought to the grid iron.  Will surely try to get to some more games this year.
307,Date of experience: September 2015,23-Sep-15,ACC,Duke,3,The New Wallace Wade Stadium,"The remodeled stadium is a wonderful change to Duke Football, with a ""tower"" for rented suites and press box under construction and to be finished next season. The whole new field, score board and walls to the seating area are completed and are very well done. A parking garage is under construction very near the stadium, that will also completed in 2016 and help with parking for sports events."
308,Date of experience: September 2015,15-Sep-15,ACC,Duke,4,Fun football game,"We attended a Duke-NC Central game. The parking flow was well managed. The food vendors were well staffed. Seating was fine, easy to see the game."
310,Date of experience: August 2015,1-Sep-15,ACC,Duke,5,**Neat Football Stadium**,About .01 mile from Cameron Indoor Stadium.     Located next to Baseball Stadium.   Check it out if you are in the area.
311,Date of experience: September 2014,24-Aug-15,ACC,Duke,5,Good Experience,Got to see the new spread offense installed and loved it> The service was nice and overall great experience
315,Date of experience: October 2014,18-Feb-15,ACC,Duke,5,Day at Wallace Wade Stadium,"Great Atmosphere for a Football game....Most of the Vendor food is very good.   Crowds lively, enthused and LOUD"
316,Date of experience: October 2014,23-Jan-15,ACC,Duke,3,Old School Stadium,"We attended Duke's football game vs Virginia and had a nice time.  The best part of this stadium is its good sightlines from the seats since it is not very large.  We also liked the variety of ethnic foods sold at stands along the concourse about the seating area.  Fans actually walk DOWN to their seats as the stadium stands in a sloped area.  There are few modern conveniences in this stadium, no overhangs for shade, and nowhere to retreat from rain...fortunately we had a gorgeous day for the game we attended.  Despite Duke's winning ways of late the fan base is largely there to socialize as basketball season is what turns Dukies on."
317,Date of experience: January 2015,4-Jan-15,ACC,Duke,3,Under construction,Stopped by for a post season look and field was completely dug up for major reconstruction.   Expect it will be back together soon.
318,Date of experience: November 2014,2-Dec-14,ACC,Duke,4,Wallace Wade Gets A Facelift,"As a regular for Duke Football games, I loved the charm of an older stadium. The stadium will undergo a major renovation in 2015 and 2016. It will be done in phases as not to interfere with the football season. I will miss the concession trailers."
319,Date of experience: November 2014,2-Dec-14,ACC,Duke,5,Nice Stadium,"Though I am not a duke fan, I admit their stadium is nice. Most seats seem to give a good view and the atmosphere is pretty nice. I like that all the concessions are outside, so you are always in the elements which is part of the football experience."
321,Date of experience: September 2014,29-Sep-14,ACC,Duke,4,History Over Modernity,"Wallace-Wade stadium is a good place to take in a college football game. It lacks many of the amenities of modern football stadiums, but it makes up for that with its history. The stadium is the only site outside of Pasadena, CA to host the Rose Bowl. Wallace-Wade hosted the 1942 Rose Bowl game after officials were afraid of a Japanese invasion of California following the attack on Pearl Harbor. The history alone makes taking in a game at this stadium worth it. Duke has also improved a large section of visitor seating, going to chair back seats as opposed to metal bleachers found throughout most of the stadium. Tickets are very affordable, so if you're in the area plan to stop by and catch a game!"
324,Date of experience: October 2013,29-Apr-14,ACC,Duke,4,Nice Family Friendly Low Cost Entertainment,Great venue for inexpensive sports entertainment. Good variety of food...fun entertainment for kids pregame outside of the stadium.Family package general admission season tickets very reasonable.
326,Date of experience: November 2013,19-Nov-13,ACC,Duke,4,Football stadium with a small town feel,"The Wallace Wade Stadium is the home of the University of Duke football team.  The stadium itself is located adjacent to the more famous Cameron Indoor Arena where the basketball teams play.  Given that Duke is a basketball school, it shows in the size and atmosphere of the Wallace Wade Stadium.  It is smaller than most other Division I schools that I've been to with a little less than 34,000 seats.  Seating is in a horseshoe with one end having no seats.Getting to the stadium can be difficult for the general public.  The parking lots are a good distance away and there are no directions on how to get to the stadium.  You will need to follow others and hope that they know where they are going.  However it only costs $10 to park which could always be worse.  You can purchase parking passes for closer lots, but don't know how much or how to obtain one.The atmosphere inside the stadium was good.  Given its small size it never got really that loud.  However the local fans seemed to get into the game, particularly when Duke started pulling away against a ranked team.  I was surprised with the variation of food options for such a small stadium.  I didn't try any, but could find almost everything that would fit my needs.  The funnel cake seemed to be the most popular option amongst the fans.The only minor issue was the usher whose attitude showed that she really didn't want to be there.  She was supposed to be helping people find their seats, but when I asked her only response was a head nod.  I had to press her for which side was best to get to my seat.  This was probably an isolated incident and wouldn't hold it against the stadium.If you are looking for something to do on a Saturday and like football, I would recommend going to the Wallace Wade Stadium.  The fans were into the game and you could feel safe bringing your kids to the game."
327,Date of experience: September 2013,18-Sep-13,ACC,Duke,4,Good Value for the Money,"I pick up tickets from an internet website, such as Stubhub, as I can usually buy them for less than face value.  The visitor parking is a bit of a walk, but it is acceptable.  I try to select certain games where I know Duke will at least be competitive.  Wake Forest, Virginia, and whichever FCS team they are playing, are usually good choices.  The stadium itself is modest, but it is a pleasant place to watch a game.  It is a place where I would feel comfortable taking my family to watch a game."
328,Date of experience: October 2022,29-Oct-22,ACC,Florida State,5,glizzie heaven,Best glizzies ever. Best team ever. Best day ever. Awoild recommend these glizzies to anyone. More relish options tho
329,Date of experience: September 2022,25-Sep-22,ACC,Florida State,1,Soak Campbell debacle!!!,FSU public safety has no clue how to run and manage a large scale event. Their law enforcement agencies had every single street closed in every direction. Had traffic gridlocked on every corner. Zero cops where needed to direct traffic. Super Bowl easier to get out of than how this is run. The stadium was extremely filthy. Some frat girl puked all over patrons and cleared out five square feet. It was disgusting. Clean up crew took an hour to get there. Food vendors were beyond slow and food was in short supply. Some not even cooked. Every single garbage can was overflowing onto ground. Security was non existent at gates and through out. I was in public safety for many decades and this operation is in awful need of serious training. Overall this was one of the worst run venues I??ve ever seen!! It took over an hour to get child back to campus which is a few 100 yards from stadium due to awful traffic control.
330,Date of experience: December 2020,17-Jan-21,ACC,Florida State,5,Huge beautiful stadium,"I'm not a football fan, but since I was visiting my daughter we decided to check out a football game.  I was so very impressed with this stadium.  It was huge and very well maintained.  The staff was also very diligent in making sure everyone was safe and kept their masks on during our time there."
331,Date of experience: December 2019,15-Nov-20,ACC,Florida State,5,Impressive,Great stadium to see a game. No obstructed views whatsoever. The huge scoreboard is great. Sound system is quality.  Concourse has plenty of room for fans.  Concessions are nice and clean with good selections.  Bathrooms were very adequate and clean!  Signage throughout the stadium made it easy to navigate.  The fans were very hospitable as well as all the staff.  Glad I got a chance to experience it. Definitely  one of the best college stadiums I have been too and I have been to many.
332,Date of experience: November 2020,8-Nov-20,ACC,Florida State,3,"ACC College Football Game, parking and pregaming","Visited for an ACC football game 11/2020.  The stadium looks nice enough with the brick exterior.  Inside, it is dated.  We sat in section 9, row 56.  The ramps are steep and so are the steps to the seats, much higher than your usual distances these days.  Exits to the concourses are at rows 10 and 50 so you can figure out how high up or down you have to go when you leave your seats.  Going up was easier than going down for us.   The concourses are dungeon-like with the restrooms located under the seating area in these tin structures.  A very tight fit inside so social distancing was tough washing your hands.  Food in my area consisted of popcorn and candy concession.  I had to walk a few gates to find a concession that sold food- hot dogs.  $15 for 2 hot dogs and a water.  I noticed no one was eating during the game but home team fans might know not to come to a game hungry.  I would imagine on a sunny day, you could get severely sunburned as most of the stadium is without cover.  Same comment for rain. There was no security screening when we entered the stadium.  Our tickets were scanned with an ""enjoy the game"" comment. I had my rain jacket and plastic tote with me too.Parking around the stadium seems to consist of primarily FSU booster reserved parking.  We arrived at the stadium area 4.5 hours before the game and we had to drive around and wait until we found a place with open general parking (must be 4 hours before game time).  We paid $20 to park at the Wesley Foundation on Pensacola St.  It's a small paved parking lot but was about .3 mile from the stadium, so easily walkable for us.  Not many places to pregame that held our interest.  We ended up at Madison Social but it was pricy, $77 for 2 appetizers and a few drinks.  Seems like it is a pregame stop for many fans."
335,Date of experience: October 2018,30-Mar-19,ACC,Florida State,2,Dump,"Bad parking, bad food selections (fats and carbs), overpriced everything. If you want to watch FSU play football- catch an away game."
338,Date of experience: September 2018,16-Sep-18,ACC,Florida State,5,Game Night!,Big time college football at its best..the fans are super fans! Band is great. Many food choices also. Its just fun to see the FSU outfits people have on. Great big stadium thats rockin!
339,Date of experience: September 2018,14-Sep-18,ACC,Florida State,5,Nice stadium,This stadium is nice! There are no bad seats and love the colors! Even on the top seats the players do not look like ants and you don't have the fear of falling. My grandson had room to dance and it was a great time!
348,Date of experience: December 2017,8-Dec-17,ACC,Florida State,5,Go Noles!,The stadium has come a long way since I was a student there in the 80s. The exterior and grounds are great. Lots of food options inside. The score boards are great and sound is also very good.
349,Date of experience: November 2017,4-Nov-17,ACC,Florida State,5,Great college football stadium,"I? have been to many football stadiums. As far as college stadiums go, it is not the best, but I? was still impressed.Most of the seating is bleacher seating and in the sun. You can rent a padded bleacher seat for a fee ($10 I? believe). The bleachers are in the sun for most of the game depending on the position of the sun ??, so use sunscreen.If you have the means and connections there is box seating and a covered area with individual seats ??.Depending on the size of your purse you may be turned away. They require a clear plastic bag if you want to carry a fair amount of stuff in. Security reasons.Food and drinks are overpriced per usual of all sporting events.The opening ceremony is great. The band, majorettes, cheerleaders ??, etc are amazing.Overall a great experience."
350,Date of experience: October 2017,28-Oct-17,ACC,Florida State,2,Pretty Boring and Be Prepared to Pay for Parking!,"The last time I was here the stadium has improved but still pretty poor considering this is supposed to be a top rated program (questionable).  You can bang your feet on the flooring and it sounds like you are at a high school game (like it is built from an erector set).  We walked into the museum at one end of the stadium and it was also very poor.  Just some things written on the wall and a few glass cases.  Not sure what a recruit sees when they come.  Also, parking is a mess, food is below average and here again the alumni give good ratings but obvious have not been to other football stadiums where they could catch a dream of what they should have."
353,Date of experience: September 2017,17-Oct-17,ACC,Florida State,5,Go NOLES,Beautifully renovated.  All seats have great vantage points.  Lots of fun with a lot of school spirit.  Lots of tradition.  Looking forward to a great season.
360,Date of experience: September 2016,20-Jul-17,ACC,Florida State,5,great place to watch the game,Man I love FSU football and the Doak S. Campbell stadium is a great place to watch the game. It is huge and it can get very loud.
361,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Jul-17,ACC,Florida State,5,Huge drama at football games,"This is an awesome experience. Aside from the game the band marching on to the field playing the famous fight song and then the National Anthem followed by Chief Osceola on renegade and planting the flaming spear is a top NCAA experience. The cheers can be deafening. It is a modern day Roman Collesium. Come early, stroll the campus, listen to the band warm up in the baseball stadium and get a parking spot.  Walk entirely around the stadium. If you can eat at the restaurant with a field view. Around the stadium is a circus atmosphere. One caution, hot afternoon games can be brutal."
362,Date of experience: November 2016,11-Jul-17,ACC,Florida State,5,Unconquored!!,"Well, you can feel the positive energy on any game day, but this Stadium and the accompanying University Center have continued to be more than that!!. It is a state of the art College stadium, Tallahassee Landmark, cornerstone to the Florida State campus and so much more!!Having been fortunate enough to grow up playing touch football in the end zones of Doak Campbell Stadium in the 60's as a kid, while watching the games (Doak held about 20,000 fans at the time), I never could have imagined what it is today! What a place and what an experience!!"
370,Date of experience: December 2016,1-Mar-17,ACC,Florida State,5,Beautiful Built Stadium,"One can feel the pride FLorida State University has for their Stadium.  It's an attractive Stadium, built to coincide with the architecture & appearance of FSU."
371,Date of experience: September 2016,14-Feb-17,ACC,Florida State,4,Perhaps the Most Effective Stadium in the USA,"A great place to dine, a great place to visit for FSU sports, and one of the Nation's best places to watch a live football game, Doak S. Campbell is outstanding."
372,Date of experience: October 2016,8-Jan-17,ACC,Florida State,5,Go Seminoles!,Seminoles rock this stadium. All the seats are great! Seminoles fans are the best and really get into the game.
374,Date of experience: November 2016,6-Dec-16,ACC,Florida State,1,Tinker Toy Stadium,"You may think this is a beautiful stadium when you're outside, and it is.  However, when you walk through the gates you get to see the real Doak.  Think of a Tinker Toy with trailers for bathrooms and concession stands.  The bathrooms have walls just like the ones in a bad 7-11, you know, the plastic walls that have tiny bumps all over it.  I'm not kidding.This place is embarrassing and a total dump."
376,Date of experience: November 2016,27-Nov-16,ACC,Florida State,5,Crowded,"Very crowded due to the game, nice scenery. Parking was very difficult and not many places that did not need a sticker or parking pass."
377,Date of experience: November 2016,24-Nov-16,ACC,Florida State,5,Great stadium,The upgrades to the stadium made it more attractive.  The bathrooms were clean and there were plenty of them.
378,Date of experience: November 2016,18-Nov-16,ACC,Florida State,5,The new renovations really make the stadium special,"The stadium has for years had a special feel to it, as it blends in wonderfully with the FSU campus.  From outside, it has a rustic look, but inside it is all modern.  The new Jumbotron is humongous and the clarity is impressive (locals refer to it as a Jimbotron in honor of the FSU coach).  Benches in most of the prime seating areas but there are cushions and private lounges in one recently renovated end zones.Nice sightlines, and when this place is placked, it is quite loud."
381,Date of experience: October 2016,1-Nov-16,ACC,Florida State,5,Not a bad seat in the house!,"I've been to about a dozen or so FSU games and have sat all around the stadium: FSU side, visitor side, end zone, from row 20 to 75 and have never had a bad seat/view.  It's definitely and old school stadium with the focus on being close to the field rather than stacking seats a mile high and stuffing as many people as possible into a small space.  FSU also boasts some of the best traditions in college football such as Chief Osceola planting the flaming spear before the game.  But my favorite is the war chant with the tomahawk chop.  It will make your hair stand up to see 60,000+ people chanting and chopping in unison. The worst thing, by far, is the parking.  You have to get there really early because unless you're a booster, you aren't going to park close to the stadium.  Parking is spread out all over the city, many times you'll park in somebody's yard and pay $20."
383,Date of experience: October 2016,31-Oct-16,ACC,Florida State,5,FSU Game,Had the best time ever. The Clemson game was a nail biter and we loved hanging out and tailgating. We paid extra and got to go up to the box to get a beer.
384,Date of experience: October 2016,31-Oct-16,ACC,Florida State,3,Stadium of contrasts,First visit to Doak Campbell stadium. The surrounding campus and area close to stadium is great - large oak trees and alot of grassy areas. Very pretty. Stadium exterior is very impressive with  brick facade. Interior stadium is like walking into a 1960's stadium - concourses look to have never been pressure washed and concessions small and old. I have been to many college stadiums and this was the most unimpressive interior I have seen.Not a good reflection on the university. Obviously spent all of the $$ on the exterior.
385,Date of experience: October 2016,26-Oct-16,ACC,Florida State,5,FSU vs UNC,"Great experience!  Pregame experience very family friendly.  Great game, especially for a Tar Heel fan!"
390,Date of experience: October 2016,16-Oct-16,ACC,Florida State,4,Scalp em,Haven't been to a game in two years but was very impressed with the additions they made to stadium. Champions club and Jumbotron is a great start. Enjoyed how the fans can choose from many different eaterys during the game. The kids helping out from the local schools is awesome. Need more assistance and catering to seniors and handicap. A place to take kids as fans from fsu are mostly very respectful and professional. Police officers and many and I appreciate all they do.
392,Date of experience: October 2016,3-Oct-16,ACC,Florida State,4,Smoking Doak!,"The Doak is now four times larger than it was when I was a FSU student athlete. Therefore I experience a bit of awe each time I visit and relive memories. I love the buzz of crowd of almost 80,000 'Nole fans cheering on the football team. Recent improvements are mostly good. The food concessions are fairly typical for stadiums in offerings and pricing. The grounds around the stadium with statues and fountains are a big plus and attractive."
394,Date of experience: September 2016,16-Sep-16,ACC,Florida State,5,NOLES RULE!,Come see the best College Football Team in America!  FSU has beautiful grounds.  And Landis Green is great for a quick siesta!
396,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,ACC,Florida State,5,Football Game,Beautiful stadium.  Concessions like in any other sports arena are over priced.  Sportswear shops    and kiosks are compatible with downtown shops.
398,Date of experience: October 2015,27-Aug-16,ACC,Florida State,5,BEST STADIUM!,"Going to a game at this stadium is just the best experience. The outside is just beautiful and so is the inside. They recently just updated the video which will make the experience even better,"
399,Date of experience: August 2016,22-Aug-16,ACC,Florida State,5,Much nicer than spending the afternoon in a swamp,I am already looking forward to the next trip to enjoy a tailgate party and football game. When you walk in the door you automatically become a Noles fan.
400,Date of experience: November 2015,22-Jun-16,ACC,Florida State,4,Good seats,"We have had season tickets to Noles games for several years now. One year we reserved the ""home"" side, but our seats weren't great. We switched back to the visitors side and love our seats.  Since I am recently handicapped, they seated me in a location that requires only two steps and is close to the elevator and bathrooms.  We just ordered our third season in the same space because we are so happy with our view.  We are also surrounded by the same people, so now we have a huge football family.  Finally, if you are handicapped and notify them, they will park you so close to the stadium.  Go 'Noles!"
405,Date of experience: October 2015,26-Mar-16,ACC,Florida State,5,Seminoles Parents Weekend,The absolute best game day experience.  Seeing the facilities and stadium improvements from 30 years ago was a great sight.
413,Date of experience: November 2015,13-Jan-16,ACC,Florida State,5,Center of the Universe,"If you are looking for the ultimate college football experience, head to Doak Campbell Stadium to see Florida State take on Clemson or Florida (in 2016) or Miami (in 2017).  Coach Jimbo Fisher's Seminoles won the 2013 National Championship and will be contenders in 2016 and 2017, thus you will see some of college football's top athletes.  Furthermore, Doak is a special place to watch the game, with 80,000+ screaming fans, the amazing world-renowned Marching Chiefs, cheerleaders, etc., etc. If you get there for a rivalry game, you'll thank me!"
414,Date of experience: November 2015,5-Jan-16,ACC,Florida State,4,Wish they would choose some different pregame music,"Depending on where you sit, the music can be too loud. Also, they tend to choose music for only the younger folks. I have attended probably 10 games so far and always enjoyed it."
416,Date of experience: October 2015,13-Dec-15,ACC,Florida State,5,Home of the FSU Seminoles,"I have attended football games here for forty years.  It has changed throughout the years with the amazing success of the Seminole football team coached by Bobby Bowden and Jimbo Fisher.  I went to the FSU game with Miami in October.  After the games, there was a fireworks display that rivaled a Fourth of July display.  If visiting the FSU campus, stop by to see statues of Bobby Bowden and the ""Uncomquered"" Osceola with the burning spear."
418,Date of experience: November 2015,4-Dec-15,ACC,Florida State,4,Very nice stadium to watch football,Stadium looks nice from the outside and from the stands but beneath the stands you can still see the old honeycomb. Florida State University redid the outside simply by adding a new brick facade all around a number of years back. They have also updated the suites & video board. There are a lot of concessions on every level so you don't have to go far to get something to eat or drink. Parking for visitors is not the easiest. Coming from the east the best thing to do is park at the civic center & ride their shuttles to the stadium. We came in from the west and were lucky enough to find a small grass parking lot that held about 80 cars only a short walk to the stadium. I can only imagine just how hot sitting on the sunny side would be in Sep. Glad we were there in Nov.
421,Date of experience: October 2015,14-Oct-15,ACC,Florida State,5,One of my favorite places on Earth!,"I LOVE attending football games at Florida State University's Bobby Bowden Field at Doak Campbell Stadium! I attend every home game. The facilities are amazing, the fans are friendly, and the traditions are so special including Chief Osceola spearing the field on the horse named Renegade. I have been to many other stadiums for other college and NFL games, but nothing compares to the experience at Doak Campbell. There is no bad seat in the house, though I prefer to sit as close to the 50-yard-line as possible. I usually end up sitting between the 20 and 30 yard lines, and it is fantastic. The Florida State University Marching Chiefs are such an incredible marching band, and they always get the crowds into the music. Performances are enhanced by the fabulous color guard and majorettes with featured baton twirlers; I never miss the half-time show. The atmosphere and energy at Doak Campbell Stadium is too special to fully put into words! The stadium is the home of the 1993, 1999, and 2013 national champions. I really love the traditions including the War Chant. Even outside the stadium, there are several statues and other attractions including the Sod Cemetery, the Sportsmanship statue, the Bobby Bowden statue, and the Unconquered statue that is lit in flames for football games. If you haven't been to a game at Doak Campbell Stadium yet, get a ticket to a football game and enjoy...and GO FSU SEMINOLES! :)"
422,Date of experience: October 2015,14-Oct-15,ACC,Florida State,5,A Seminole fans dream come true!,"I have been a Noles fan for over 30 years now and this was my first visit to Doak.  Thanks to my amazing wife, my dream has finally come true.  Spent the entire day on campus, tailgating with the greatest fans in the NCAA.  Then I got to watch my Noles give ""duh U"" its annual beat down.  Go Noles!  It was a great game.  There is nothing in the world that can compare to 80,000 fans doing the Seminole War Chant in the 4th qtr of a rivalry game.  A truly magical experience and highly recommended!"
427,Date of experience: September 2015,9-Sep-15,ACC,Florida State,5,We love the Florida State Seminoles!,"Beautiful stadium, home of big time college football, and the #2 band in the nation, the Marching Chiefs. We go every year for at least one game and always have a great time!"
428,Date of experience: September 2015,7-Sep-15,ACC,Florida State,4,Do the Chop!,"Take in a game at enjoy the excitement! Stadium is close quarters though. Can hardly move down the isles as seats are so close, its an old college stadium."
429,Date of experience: September 2015,6-Sep-15,ACC,Florida State,5,First FSU game!,"This was my first Florida State game I had ever been to! Beautiful outdoor brick stadium. Just a tip, bring a seat cushion with a back on it for comfort. No alcohol allowed on campus, so pre game before you come. Seemed a lot of people were confused about what section they were in while they were looking for their seats. Parking is a commodity, so be prepared for a little walk unless you're part of the booster club. The game ended with some good fireworks. Great game with the Noles chalking up their first win!"
433,Date of experience: November 2014,1-Sep-15,ACC,Florida State,5,Beautiful!!!!,"This is my favorite stadium!  It's so exhilarating to see 80,000 Seminole fans doing the 'chop! Definitely get to a game!"
435,Date of experience: November 2014,12-Aug-15,ACC,Florida State,5,Always a Seminole,Nothing better than Seminole Football on a Saturday afternoon. The roar of the crowd is like no other. Renegade was voted the number one mascot in college football.
442,Date of experience: November 2014,24-Jun-15,ACC,Florida State,5,A Young stadium steeped in tradition.,"While this stadium is not ""old"" in the big scheme of college football, I've been around to watch it's transformation, and it is now one of the most beautiful stadiums I have visited.  The brick fa??ade and towering spires are steeped in a great tradition, although it continues to grow and adapt.  This stadium holds approximately 85,000 fans, but is usually easy to navigate and find your seats. There is plenty of ""stadium food"" to choose from, and most of it is not bad!"
443,Date of experience: September 2014,24-Jun-15,ACC,Florida State,4,Must see in the fall,"Yes, it is old, but look from the inside out. The atmosphere during game is exhilarating. Great for kids also. The Cief come out of a ""garage"" and there is always Renegade and Osceola. (horse and rider).Take a tour if you can through all the surrounding buildings and University Center."
445,Date of experience: September 2014,12-Apr-15,ACC,Florida State,5,"Football games in the fall, in Tallahassee are the best","Visiting Tallahassee in the fall, and catching a football game is about the most fun as you trip down memory lane to your own college days. There is something timeless about the experience. The one thing that I found to be less than ideal was the limited parking and the expensive fees to park in some areas. The range of m resturants was fine and the pre-game festivities were really fun. Don't miss going to a game, if you're in the area."
447,Date of experience: October 2014,20-Jan-15,ACC,Florida State,3,"Wow, needs to be refurbished!","For many years we have traveled all over the SEC for football games. Other than Tennessee, all of the stadiums are clean, up to date and perfect places to view games. Then we came to Talahassee!! This is a beautiful campus with lovely buildings but the stadium services are really bad. The womens' bathrooms were dirty, damp, and the ceilings were peeling. The concession areas were straight out of a horror film and the people who were working the stadium were like the living dead. It was a dirty, dark and dismal experience. But then, the game started, the sun came out and it was a great victory and a good day. Now, I realize that truthfully, Tennessee's stadium is better and I can't imagine saying that. Come on, clean this place up!!"
450,Date of experience: November 2014,1-Jan-15,ACC,Florida State,5,Impressive,I couldn't get over the size of this stadium!  Coming from a school that did not (and still doesn't) have a great football team it was so surprising to me to see such a large stadium for college ball.  I wish I would have known ahead of time that you could rent bleacher chairs but a lot of the game was viewed standing up so I guess it did not matter.
452,Date of experience: September 2014,29-Dec-14,ACC,Florida State,4,Standard Stadium,"We've watched many games at this stadium. The stadium itself is standard, but the games are interesting and the food is actually pretty good. Bring a cushion for the seat if you need/want one - the seats are metal and very uncomfortable. Also, bring a jacket depending on where you're sitting - people start shivering once the sun starts to dip at a night game. (It gets really cold.) Plenty of parking make getting to the stadium easy."
453,Date of experience: November 2014,7-Dec-14,ACC,Florida State,5,Great place to watch football,"Probably been here 15 times for games and have never been disappointed with the view,  The seats are metal and uncomfortable but you are up and down often cheering so it's not that bad.  I have never gone there without tailgating prior to the game so I'm not sure where Slayridez06 was but they sure were not at Doak.  During game day all the parking lots are full of people tailgating.  I have had traffic stopped by the Police so that I could walk across the road with a drink in my hand."
454,Date of experience: December 2014,5-Dec-14,ACC,Florida State,4,Great Place To Watch FSU Game.......No Alcohol for Sale,"Most of the seats are bleachers with no backs. So bring a cushion if you cant handle sitting on a metal bench. Some of the ""Season Ticket"" seats have a temporary cushioned seat with cushioned back installed for each game. Plenty of food available for purchase, but they do not sell any alcohol in the stadium, and alcohol is NOT permitted in the parking lots either. Bathrooms were the usual mess you find at any stadium. There is NO COVER....so you will be out in whatever the weather for the day. Every seat in the house is great, and the Vibe is amazing. If this review helps your planning, please leave me a helpful vote.......GO NOLES !!!"
455,Date of experience: November 2014,3-Dec-14,ACC,Florida State,4,Fun College Football Experience,"Really enjoyed this trip. It far exceeded my expectations in terms of affordability. Parking was only $10 at the Civic Center, which is within walking distance of the Stadium and also offers a shuttle for $5 round trip. Traffic flow leaving wasn't as bad as I expected. Concessions prices were very fair. All in all a really good place to watch college football."
456,Date of experience: November 2014,2-Dec-14,ACC,Florida State,5,"""BEST PLACE TO WATCH COLLEGE FOOTBALL""","A must if you visit Tallahassee in the fall on Saturday's. Just to see Chief Osceola & his horse renegade ride out on Bobby Bowden's Field & Spike the Flaming Spear !! This is ""the best tradition in College Football"" - Then watch the No 1 Seminole's play Football!!!"
457,Date of experience: November 2014,1-Dec-14,ACC,Florida State,3,It was pretty good,"I am thinking FSU could do a good job on a good day.  However, the weather sucked for the FSU/BC game and once you get past the gorgeous facade, some of the stadiums issues become apparent.  First, many of the concession places don't take credit cards.  Second, the concourse drains poorly.  I have been to lots of stadiums that were better."
458,Date of experience: November 2014,10-Nov-14,ACC,Florida State,5,Travel Tips for First-Timers to Doak Campbell Stadium,"Getting ThereWe drove to Tallahassee from Fort Walton Beach to attend Homecoming 2014 Virginia vs FSU at 6:30PM on a Saturday night. Attended with my adult brother and my teenage son. We elected to not take in the Friday night pre-game activities that we heard were a lot of fun. You might want to consider those if you're intent on staying the night the evening before the game. Hotels are abundant but very pricey (hundreds of dollars per room is typical) for home game weekends, which factored into our decision to drive over on game day. We didn't intend to tailgate so our objective was to get there, get parked, take in some of the pre-game festivities and get to our seats in time for the on-field traditions prior to kick-off. (OK. To be completely honest, we considered stopping by the Publix near FSU and taking a selfie with crab legs in the seafood department. But we elected not to do so.) We left by 12:15PM Central Time and arrived by 3:45 with plenty of time to spare to walk to the stadium and take in the pre-game ambience. We had purchased our tickets months ahead of time in August on StubHub as our game was to be a sell-out because of Homecoming. That being said, I would recommend getting your tickets purchased well in advance of the game although I did encounter a handful of scalpers while walking up to the stadium.ParkingI researched ahead of time and learned that parking would be a challenge around the stadium due to game day traffic. So, I purchased a parking ticket via ParkWhiz.com for Shell Station on West Tennessee Street. $30. Sheesh. We arrived two and a half hours before kick-off to take in the sights. Traffic was already starting to swell in the area but there was ample parking available at the gas station and our car was in full view of the attendant the entire time. Also, when the game was over, getting out was easy because we didn't have to fight traffic.Walking to the StadiumThat being said, it was a bit of a hike from W Tennessee Street down Stadium Drive to the stadium from our parking location. I'm in good shape and didn't mind the walk. But, be prepared to walk, and walk, and walk leisurely 15 minutes through the campus (or for about 15 minutes along the west side of Stadium Drive if you're not inclined to go on campus) to get to Doak Campbell Stadium.BathroomsThey are in abundance in the stadium beneath the bleachers. They facilities I visited mid-way through the game seemed to be adequately maintained, but I wouldn't call them pristine by any measure. LOL. Hand soaps and sinks were readily available.Pre-Game FestivitiesI highly recommend going to the Mike Martin Field at Dick Howser Stadium (the baseball stadium) just adjacent to the north of Doak Campbell Stadium two hours prior to kick-off. It's free and open to the public. Just grab a seat and enjoy the FSU Marching Chiefs band warm up as each section performs briefly (e.g., flutes/woodwinds, brass, tubas, drum corp) and then the entire band plays. It's a great way to tap into the excitement of game day energy and be sure to bring your video camera or smartphone to capture the event. Fans will get their first game day opportunity to participate with the band and other fans in the famous Seminole war chant. Fun and memorable.Taking In the HeritageWander around to the ""north"" side of the stadium (which is actually the northwest side to most people who pay attention to maps) and you'll see a statue of Bobby Bowden and you can peek into the stadium and see all the NCAA championship trophies in clear view. This is also the side of the stadium where the locker rooms are located, so FSU players enter and exit the stadium from this side. We purchased a $5 game day program from a vendor walking aroundFoodAs a first-timer, I was taken in by the smell of food being cooked by the tailgaters all around us. We were told there would be food vendors in abundance. But, we did not see any...until we entered the stadium. The food vendors are underneath the stands inside the stadium building. That's where you'll find the food. Be prepared to pay cash. Prices are in line with most stadium food prices I have experienced. Stadium concession stands are plentiful and redundant all around and there can buy nachos for five dollars, pretzels and drinks for a bit less, popcorn, peanuts, etc. A few name brand vendors (e.g., Sonny's Barbecue, Chick-Fil-A, and Pizza Hut) are located near the south entrance and the fare is limited but familiar if you frequent those places. Late in the game when it started getting very cool, we were able to purchase hot chocolate for $5 near the name brand vendors. Interestingly, hot chocolate was not available for sale at the stadium concession stands.Memorabilia and CollectiblesIf you want to take a remembrance home with you, there were memorabilia vendors selling collectibles near the south entrance. There were also t-shirt vendors in abundance. Their offerings are nothing compared to the motherlode to be found in the souvenir shop that is open throughout the game at the south entrance of the stadium. We spent 30 minutes shopping after the game because the offerings are so abundant. I took home a dog leash for my sister who is a dog lover and FSU fan girl. Pre-Game Events In the StadiumThe pre-game introductions are a high production value event. The band sits in a reserved section above the south end zone. They begin playing well before kick-off. It was Homecoming for our game and they made their way on to the field with an alumni band to play the alma mater and national anthem. They also played the visiting team's fight song, which I thought was a classy gesture. The team introductions are a full-on spectacle with the starter's introductory profile mug shots emblazoned on high-definition TV screens on either end of the stadium. When the team runs out, fireworks go off en masse on the northern perimeter of the stadium. The team forms a line on the west side of the field as the spectacle that is Chief Osceola and Renegade unfolds before war chants. It's unlike anything I've seen at a football game. The energy is indescribable.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osceola_and_RenegadeSeats and the GameOur seats were in Section 30 row 6 which was near between the 5 and 10 yard line. We had a great side view of the goal and the various FSU cheerleader squads rotated throughout the game while performing right in front of us. There was a rolling network camera rig on a track on the perimeter of the field that rolled in and out of  our view during the game. But, it never blocked our view. If you want to tap into the energy and enthusiasm emanating from the field, the first 10-15 rows are the place to be. We were delighted with our seats although we did require the assistance of the high-definition stadium screens to capture the flow of some of the running plays. Even so, I wouldn't change a thing. Our seatmates were polite and pleasant and...fully...fully engaged in the game. Shouts and droning choruses began each time Virginia prepared to snap the ball. We got our own personal hand-held videos of FSU touchdowns and goal-line stops. We were also close enough to the band to enjoy the sights and sounds up close.In SummaryI have traveled the world and seen many sights. But, the spectacle of FSU college football in a meaningful game against a division opponent is unrivaled if you're a sports fan. It will be a lifelong memory for me, my son and my brother. In preparation for my trip, I found it difficult to find information for first-timers that spoke to the game day experience at Doak Campbell Stadium. So, I took the time to write down my impressions here for the benefit of others who will also be attending the first time in the future. I hope that the sharing of our experience has been helpful. And, yes, we will be making a return trip to another game in the future. I don't know why I waited so long. Go 'Noles!"
459,Date of experience: October 2014,22-Oct-14,ACC,Florida State,4,Awesome Game!,"Went to see Notre Dame play FSU this past saturday, it was an awesome game experience! The campus is scenic with a lot of neat areas to check out before the game. The stadium seats pack you in a little tighter than some of the other stadiums which was a slight drawback, but we stood most of the game anyway. Concessions were a tad on the high side, I'm guessing because they just won the national title. Decent selection though and not a lot of waiting. Parking was a bear because we didn't have a pass and it seemed like every single lot required some sort of pass or club membership. We did do this trip last minute though so probably our fault. Any first timers going in the future should get advice on parking and it shouldn't be a problem. Overall awesome time though, especially cool seeing the chief plant the flaming spear into the field before kickoff!"
460,Date of experience: October 2014,21-Oct-14,ACC,Florida State,4,Great place to watch the game even if you are an opposing fan,"This was my first visit to the Seminoles stadium and it did not disappoint relative to the friendliness of the fans and the beauty of the stadium grounds. There are some excellent statues all around the stadium, including Unconquered, Sportsmanship and of course, Bobby Bowden. The Sportsmanship statue was my favorite. Although we almost beat the Seminoles in the last few seconds, there was no insulting comments or jeers from Seminole fans. The tailgate experience was first rate and they truly exude Southern hospitality. Every seat in the stadium provides an excellent view of the game. The only downsides-you could hardly hear the public address system to know what penalty was called during the game and exiting the stadium is definitely an extreme chore. From leaving the stands themselves (even going down huge ramps, we were backed up several times and had to stop and wait--can't they open more exits at the end?!!) and the traffic out of the campus is almost unbearable. However, you can't miss the game day experience at this stadium."
461,Date of experience: October 2014,21-Oct-14,ACC,Florida State,3,Sardine in a sardine can!,"Don't get me wrong..watching the Seminoles play football is always excellent especially at Bobby Bowden Field, but this stadium was not built with the comfort of the fan in mind.  It was built to squeeze in as many fans as cheaply as possible.  The seats are narrow and cramped and the concessions are poor and bathrooms are dated and dirty.  When the stadium is full like it was this past Saturday night (Go Noles!) it is nearly impossible to walk down the aisle and stairs as fans are literally sitting in the aisles and along the ends of the benches. The production is definitely second to none as far as the pre-game with the band, Chief Osceola and Renegade is something really special to watch and the game will go down as an all time classic but I hate the feeling of being a sardine squeezed into a sardine can. If it wasn't for the atmosphere I'd stay home in the comfort of my own home and watch the game on TV."
462,Date of experience: September 2014,12-Sep-14,ACC,Florida State,1,Stadium Salt on Pop Corn,"Just saying....I gave several people around me the opportunity to taste one (1) piece of pop corn I purchased from the concession stand.  EVERY person said, ""no thank you"" to a second piece, because of the amount of salt.  It is really hard to explain, but I would guess it was comparable to eating a piece of rock salt. Me nor my friend that also got a box could eat it all, or even close. I am not saying, 'do not root for your Seminoles', but I am saying, ""do not get any pop corn"".All in All....FSU does a terrible job serving food and concessions.  You may want to use one of the outside vendors that pay a fortune, I am guessing, to even be in the stadium, but most of their food has a good flavor and can be just as filling.p.s. FSU.........the extreme amount of salt did not make us go buy a second $6 soda."
463,Date of experience: September 2014,11-Sep-14,ACC,Florida State,5,What an experience,Even though I'm not a Seminoles fan I had a great time.  To see Chief Osceola and Renegade along with the dedicated fans was worth it.  All the seats at the stadium are good seats.
464,Date of experience: November 2013,2-Sep-14,ACC,Florida State,5,Go Noles,I am a die hard Nole fan and this is my second home! I love the atmosphere and excitement you experience during the football games. Win or lose this is the place to be during football season!

469,Date of experience: September 2021,26-Sep-21,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Great stadium for football,"Great venue for a game anytime of day, but especially at night.  You get a fantastic view of the Atlanta skyline looking to the south.  Excellent sight lines, not a bad seat.  Oldest on campus college stadium in the country."
470,Date of experience: November 2019,8-Dec-19,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Great Stadium Views,Every seat is close to the action. Fantastic skyline views of Atlanta especially at night. More concessions would make it perfect.
471,Date of experience: October 2019,11-Nov-19,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,Great stadium to visit and passionate yellow jackets  fans,"We visited the stadium fir the match against Pittsburgh. Easy stadium to find and gain entrance. Loved the pre match entertainment , and the yellow jackets fans support for their team even though they were having a losing season and lost this match too. Great views across downtown especially after dark. Loved it !!!"
472,Date of experience: September 2019,15-Sep-19,ACC,Georgia Tech,2,Great game - but staff need to back off when it??s 98 degrees and people looking for shade!!,We went to the game 9/7/2019The game was soooo hot! I stepped under a stairwell because I felt faint. This stadium worker came up on me yelling telling meTo move . I asked her to back off as I felt faint. She continued yelling at me. There was only 2 people- who also looked faint- standing or sitting there with me.. it was about the beginning of the second quarter so there wasn??t heavy traffic .. she was relentless so I went to concession area. Your workers need trained on hospitality and just kindness in general!!!!! There was no cold water . I bought 3 bottles bc lines to drinking fountains were so long and I needed hydrated quickly . About 3rd quarterSomeone told me about water tower outside . I got one bottle filled and when I went back it was totally empty.. this huge 7 foot water station empty... so I had to buy 3 more hot water bottles .. this is so poorly laid out... and no shaded areas without getting SCREAMED at by staff...
473,Date of experience: September 2019,15-Sep-19,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Beautiful view of the city,The stadium is old and offers very little protection from the weather but it has a beautiful view of the city
475,Date of experience: September 2018,25-Feb-19,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Good experience,Went for a football game. Location is good- an easy walk from our hotel. Lots of decent food and drink options. Great view of the game as well as the city skyline! Fans were well behaved and we did not see any trouble.
476,Date of experience: November 2018,3-Feb-19,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Awesome Football Venue!!,This is a wonderful Football Stadium. We had great seats and had a wonderful game. We Wish Coach Johnson a fond farewell and seeing the last home game was a thrill.
477,Date of experience: October 2018,28-Jan-19,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,"Really neat old stadium, fans not so much","We came down to Atlanta to see Clemson play Georgia Tech.  We enjoyed the stadium but not the concessions.I waited in line for approximately 45 minutes to get my food an missed most of the 2nd qtr.  We were in the upper deck in the end zone and they don't have enough concessions there or workers.We enjoyed the pre-game activities.  Heard the band play and watched the Clemson players get off the bus.Overall, it was a good experience and I would come again but the concession wait really put a damper on our overall experience."
478,Date of experience: November 2018,14-Jan-19,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,"Great Stadium, Rude Fans","Staff and facilities great & easily walk able/accessible from where we parked; fans in attendance, not so much. We were near the student section but not only did they stand the entire game, they stood ON their seats, making it impossible (even for my 6'2"" brother in law) to see without standing on our own seats. At first I thought it was just me/us but I saw the frustration on the faces of everyone around us attending for the visiting team. Not likely to travel there again."
479,Date of experience: August 2018,5-Jan-19,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,Decent stadium to take in a game,"We??ve been to Bobby Dodd for multiple events from Georgia-Georgia Tech games to Atlanta United games. All the seats in the stadium have a pretty good view of the action on the field. We??ve sat everywhere from the uppers for soccer to the 30 yard line in the 5th row for the Tech-JSU game and have never had an issue with the view. The corridors where concessions are seem really narrow and tight. When Atlanta United played there, you couldn??t get around the lines to move around at all. The concession area has your basic football food for your insane stadium prices. The lines to get into the stadium for big games can also be rough. Not a bad place for a game and close to decent restaurants for before or after an event."
480,Date of experience: December 2018,30-Dec-18,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,Great ACC Stadium with a lot of history,"I haven't gotten to see a game inside the stadium, but have attended a few events with my son (a Tech student), in the club area. The stadium has a wonderful intimate feel, and most certainly comes alive on game day. The stadium is historic, and worth wandering around even if you can't watch a game."
481,Date of experience: October 2018,13-Oct-18,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Great time,This is such an intimate feeling stadium. Super fun. Crowd was great and we truly enjoyed the game. We will be back!
482,Date of experience: September 2018,4-Oct-18,ACC,Georgia Tech,3,Nice stadium...OK atmosphere,"I was here on parents' weekend with my daughter who attends Georgia Tech.  The stadium is nice enough, though it was an 80 degree day and we baked in the sun.  It's not the same atmosphere as you'll find in a Big 10 stadium, where there's 110,000 screaming fans, mostly because the football team is just OK.  We were on bleacher seats in the end zone, but there are a ton of college football stadiums with the same type of seating so it's hard to be critical of that fact.  It's easy access in an out of the stadium and overall a very pleasant experience."
483,Date of experience: September 2018,17-Sep-18,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,Great Stadium to watch football...,"Bobby Dodd stadium is a quaint, historic venue nestled among the skyscrapers in midtown Atlanta.  Sightlines for most seats are excellent and since it's small 90% of seats are relatively close to the field.  Upper deck on the east side of the field is very low, giving a closer-to-field and overhead perspective that is simply awesome.  Tech has great football history-but a student and alumni base of nerds to whom football can not always be the #1 obsession, so really good seats can usually be had.  Amenities are not-so-modern.  However, for 2018 they have upgraded the availability of food and added filtered stations for bottled water (though they need more).  Sports fans should go to at least one game here.  GREAT VALUE."
484,Date of experience: October 2017,22-Aug-18,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,Quintessential College Venue,"I have been to many GT football games and always enjoy my trip.  The crowd can be up and down with the team, but it always retains the traditions that come with on-campus college football.  I love the whistle, 4th quarter tradition, and trips to the Varsity before the game.  I've never tried the huge upper deck in the endzone, but the views of the game are usually pretty good."
485,Date of experience: November 2017,6-Aug-18,ACC,Georgia Tech,3,Dawgs win AGAIN!!!,"I have been to Bobby Dodd quite a few times, and over the years (some 45 or so) The Bumble Bees have won only a sparing few. I guess it is somewhat appropriate we allow them to win occasionally to keep it interesting. I realize Tech is a good school (if you have your slide rule), but my pharmacy degree at UGA is a true academic achievement and has served me well for the length of my practicing career. I look forward to the next drubbing we will give them."
486,Date of experience: November 2017,13-May-18,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,Good college atmosphere,"Attended football game, sat in end zone with students.  This stadium has old school charm, seats are relatively close to the sidelines.  Easy to get in and out.  Drawback, only one jumbotron and it was behind us, had to strain my neck to see reviews."
487,Date of experience: November 2017,8-Apr-18,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Great place to see Jackets play!,Where else can you see the GT Yellow Jackets play at home?  Great sight lines and student band.  BYOB!
488,Date of experience: November 2017,30-Jan-18,ACC,Georgia Tech,2,"If your team is playing here, go","Great views of downtown.  Small stadium so it's easy to get in and out of.  Always easy to get a ticket since GT fans don't really watch football, and if you are the visiting team you are probably going to win.  Take a good book as watching the triple-option is a bit boring.  Take eye protection for the game in case Tech scores and slide-rules fly out of the breast pockets of the GT fans in attendance.  On the bright side, if your electronic device is not functioning properly there will be plenty of people there that can help you, and you can trade Star Wars memorabilia for preferred parking spots, preferably pajamas."
490,Date of experience: October 2017,21-Jan-18,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Our Favorite Stadium,"Bobby Dodd is a smaller, more intimate stadium with a beautiful view of the city.  We have had seats in various locations and never had a bad seat.  The Jumbotron keeps you up on anything you may have missed. The ""walk"" is the best we have seen!  The drum corp, cheerleaders, and dance team are at the end of the street waiting on the buses to arrive.  It is very festive atmosphere, and a fairly long walk for the team and coaches who are met by the band before entering the locker room.  You will have a great college football experience at Bobby Dodd!"
491,Date of experience: November 2017,29-Nov-17,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,Great downtown venue with bit of history,"Well recommended, fairly small stadium but that means you are close to the field, and remnants of an old stand to look at too, easy to reach on public transport, great spot to catch a game and pageantry"
492,Date of experience: November 2017,27-Nov-17,ACC,Georgia Tech,3,Atlanta skyline,"Had the pleasure of watching the Georgia Bulldogs beat the Yellowjackets here 38-7 over Thanksgiving weekend. At a capacity of 55,000, it??s on the smaller side, but more intimate with good sightlines from most every seat. Seats in the north end zone have the Atlanta city skyline as the backdrop for play on the field."
493,Date of experience: October 2017,23-Oct-17,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,Georgia Tech Game,"We took in our first college football game and loved it.It is a very good stadium to see a game in.  It really doesn't matter where your seats are, good views from everywhere.They have concession stands, no alcohol during college games.Lots of events around the stadium and don't miss a hotdog at the ""Varsity"" on your way to a game here!"
497,Date of experience: September 2016,22-May-17,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Americas oldest college stadium,"This downtown on-campus classic is small by todays standards, but makes for a fun ""campus day"" experience for fall football.  Historic Grant Field at Bobby Dodd (great gentleman as well as hall of fame coach (and player)) makes a fun afternoon or sometime evening.  Parking a challenge but adequate"
499,Date of experience: September 2016,21-Apr-17,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,Love this place,Nothing better than a Saturday spent here in the fall.  Easy to get in and out.  Folks are helpful and friendly.  Good views from every seat.
500,Date of experience: October 2016,12-Apr-17,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Go Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets,Home to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jacket football team.  Great game watching venue for fans and visitors.  Good food and drink available.  Join the fans and root the Jackets on to victory!
502,Date of experience: September 2016,4-Mar-17,ACC,Georgia Tech,3,Classic stadium,"Classic stadium. Could use some updates and relabeling of rows/seat numbers. All in all a good, classic ACC football experience...just don't expect it to be like Alabama."
503,Date of experience: October 2016,1-Feb-17,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Great place to see a game,Nice sized stadium and usually tickets aren't too hard.  Games are fun and everything walking distance to Midtown Atlanta
504,Date of experience: September 2016,29-Dec-16,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,Been to many games here,"Have been going to Bobby Dodd for years watching the Jackets.  Relatively small stadium so most seats aren't bad for viewing.  The sun can be miserable in the north seats so bring a brimmed hat.  Food choices are better in the west stands, go before half time or you'll wait in line for a while. The view of the ATL skyline is nice. Parking can be difficult around the stadium, we park across the highway in a deck and walk over, Overall decent stadium to watch football but I prefer Sanford anyday!"
505,Date of experience: November 2016,8-Nov-16,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,Georgia Tech vs Duke,Fun day and really family friendly.  First college game that we attended and it was a lot of fun.  We sat on the Visitor side but entered through the Home side and if you can get tickets on the Home side its much more open and way more vendors.  Either way really enjoyable.
506,Date of experience: October 2016,18-Oct-16,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Went for a game,Attended for a Ga Tech vs Ga Southern game and great atmosphere.  Never a long wait to get drinks and food
507,Date of experience: October 2016,18-Oct-16,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Great family fun!,"Go Jackets!  We had a blast at the game.  This stadium is quite clean and family friendly.  We've been going to games here for years, and I'm totally comfortable bringing our three and five year old children.  The fans are generally surprisingly nice, and the camaraderie can't be beat."
508,Date of experience: October 2016,16-Oct-16,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Tech Football Game,"I took my 4 boys, ages 13, 12, 9, 7 to the Georgia Tech football game on Saturday. This was our 4th annual pilgrimage to ""The Flats"". Great family environment - historic stadium, friendly people, and all the seats have good viewing angles. I recommend not sitting too close with small kids as they won't be able to see all ends of the field. 10 rows up works great for my people. Go Jackets!"
509,Date of experience: October 2016,6-Oct-16,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,Pleasant Game Watching Experience,I liked the stadium. It had a small town feel in the heart of a big city.  Staff was good and kicked out few unruly fans early.  It was a much more enjoyable experience than watching a game at Sunlife Stadium in Miami where I am used to going.  Nobody spilled a beer on me which was a real treat.
510,Date of experience: September 2016,4-Oct-16,ACC,Georgia Tech,3,Historic stadium,Enjoyed our visit for the Clemson game.  We were high up in the endzone but the mass of Clemson fans were around us.  Pleasant and knowledgable staff. Thanks for a good visit.
511,Date of experience: October 2016,2-Oct-16,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,Good Stadium,Went to the Clemson vs GT game last week and got a chance to attend a game there.  Food was decent and somewhat reasonably priced.
512,Date of experience: October 2016,1-Oct-16,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Great vista,There doesn't seem to be a bad seating area.  The field has been easily visible from the three different areas we have watched games from.  But the best part of this stadium is the vista of the Atlanta skyline
513,Date of experience: September 2016,29-Sep-16,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Great Stadium,"A great place to go see the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. West stands is the best area. pretty good food choices. No alcohol. No in-out pass,"
514,Date of experience: September 2016,26-Sep-16,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,THE oldest stadium in college football,"If you love tradition, if you love history, as visit to North Ave with fill you with the sense college football history like no other place. Four National Championships in the 55,000 seat stadium is the right place to be if you love college football the head south to downtown to the college hall of fame!"
515,Date of experience: September 2016,22-Sep-16,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,Tech v. Clemson,Stadium is the oldest stadium in the FBS. Traditional and unique all rolled into one. Easy to get to and parking not a problem.
516,Date of experience: September 2016,22-Sep-16,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Great Environment,"Went to Georgia Tech football game and really enjoy the total experience. I have been to several games in recent years, including with younger children. Rarely encountered overly rowdy, foul mouthed fans. Smaller than most stadiums with nice older style layout. Good to study surrounding area for parking options before first trip."
518,Date of experience: September 2016,9-Sep-16,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Go Jackets,This is the best stadium and the best team. I may be a little biased being a Yellow Jacket/ Tech fan
519,Date of experience: October 2015,23-Aug-16,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Classic American stadium,"Since my Dad took me in the '50s to today's modern stadium, we love to feel the memories of Bobby himself"
520,Date of experience: October 2015,28-Jul-16,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Good place,Good place to see a game. You do not need to drive because public transportation is easy. A stop at the Varsity is a must!
521,Date of experience: November 2015,27-Jul-16,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Fun stadium with a beautiful view of the city.,"The campus is beautiful, with a great atmosphere, really perfect for tailgating. The view of the city is incredible, especially at night."
523,Date of experience: October 2015,9-Jun-16,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,Beautiful venue for a night game,"We visited for a Georgia Tech Thursday night game. The view of the downtown skyline is breathtaking. The seats were set-back pretty far from the field, which is indicative of an older stadium. Overall we really enjoyed the experience."
525,Date of experience: September 2015,28-Apr-16,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,Great View of Atlanta in the West Side Seats,Great for watching Georgia Tech games (obviously). Plenty of parking lots around the area are open for tailgating and thousands of people walk around campus getting to and from the game. If your seats are on the west end of the stadium you'll get great views of Atlanta.
528,Date of experience: October 2015,17-Apr-16,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,Nice stadium,"all seats have good visibility, crowd is more pleasant than the Athens stadium , parking is a challenge (but that's to be expected for any stadium) and the food is not extremely overpriced.  Overall it's a very positive experience to see a game at Bobby Dodd stadium."
529,Date of experience: October 2015,24-Mar-16,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,in the middle of downtown,"I always come for the tech football games. it is a pretty small stadium but it has GREAT views of downtown atlanta. i was there at night and you could see the ferris wheel by centennial. the atmosphere is great, the people are nice, the concessions are efficient. its located right in the middle of the fraternity houses and some dorms so it's not the easiest stadium to just park and come in. You really have to find a safe place to park and walk for 20 minutes before you are even on campus."
530,Date of experience: September 2015,23-Mar-16,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Great place to watch a football game,Been coming here since I was a small child.  Great place to watch a football game.  Good location and easy to get to.  Go Tech.
531,Date of experience: November 2015,3-Mar-16,ACC,Georgia Tech,2,Sat in the new section in the clouds!,"I have been here twice.  Once with a long time GA Tech ticket holder where we sat in a fairly original part of the stadium.  The iron work was covered in decades of thick paint and once was probably attractive.  The facilities were a century old and looked it.The next visit we sat in the new North end.  The incline was horrific!  It seemed as if I was walking straight up.  I felt like I was going to die.  Very Unpleasant!  When we got to out seats I looked at the boys and said ""I'm not moving!  I'm not leaving!  I'm not walking anyone to the bathroom!  When I go down these stairs I am never coming back here again!""Go to a Ga Tech Game!  Enjoy the college atmosphere!  But if you are sitting in the Upper Deck on the North End you Must Be In Marathon Physical Shape Or You May Die!!!!Oh Yes - Parking Is HORRIBLE!!!!!"
533,Date of experience: October 2015,9-Feb-16,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,Good place for Football,"We got GA Tech package season tickets, with upper deck seats. great view. Only problem is people who stand the whole game. If you want to stand to watch the game don't buy a seat!"
534,Date of experience: September 2015,2-Feb-16,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,A great stadium at Tech,"Since I went to Georgia Tech, I have been the stadium for various games. It is always good to catch up on a game if you happen to be in Atlanta."
535,Date of experience: October 2015,10-Jan-16,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,A HELLUVA Stadium!,"I love tailgating at GaTech home games. The school has things well organizied and it is a great experience. The stadium is efficient and safe. Do you homework regarding parking, I wouldn't want to just show up and look for a space."
536,Date of experience: November 2015,28-Nov-15,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,Football Game  Georgia Tech vs Georgia,"Facilities nice, easy access to seats, restrooms clean. Ladies restrooms have the normal long lines. Concession lines also long. Suggest a stroll across very pretty collegiate campus as you will be amazed how pretty Ga Tech is. It's hard to Imagine your'll in the middle of metropolitan Atlanta."
537,Date of experience: November 2015,19-Nov-15,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,University in town experience,"Grant Field at Bobby Dodd Stadium is home to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets.  The view from here to the city of Atlanta is impressive at night. The press box area is fairly basic when compared to larger Universities. The openness of the stadium on the South end gives sight to the city.  This is a smaller stadium when compared to universities in the South, but still a good place to visit when you are in Atlanta."
538,Date of experience: November 2015,16-Nov-15,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,Nice stadium with friendly people,"Visited on a Thursday night and was impressed with the friendliness of everyone that we encountered - from the ushers to the concession stand personnel.  Smiles all around. Not bad sight lines, even though we had seats near the end zone."
539,Date of experience: November 2015,13-Nov-15,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,Tech Football,Very clean. Easy access from anywhere in Atlanta.  Concessions stands are numerous and staffed with very friendly people.  Reasonable prices and a good selection.  Not a bad seat in the house.
540,Date of experience: November 2015,13-Nov-15,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,Great Downtown views- Georgia Tech Football,"Went to a night time game at Georgia Tech.  The stadium can be difficult to get to by driving due to all of the Atlanta traffic but if you are willing to walk, its not a bad place. Great views with nearly any seat in the stadium.  Plenty of restrooms, and CLEAN.  Pretty views of the Atlanta night skyline. Great place- however, I would recommend increasing the height of the railing on the upper decks.  Could be very easy for someone to fall over (especially kids).  Gate 1 and 2 are easy to get in"
541,Date of experience: November 2015,12-Nov-15,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,Georgia Tech-Virginia Tech,Historic Grant Field at Bobby Dodd Stadium is one of the best venues to watch a game. Located in the middle of Atlanta with a beautiful urban campus with friendly students and great tailgate parties.
542,Date of experience: October 2015,1-Nov-15,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,GaTech Beats Florida State!,What a great game to see in such a historic stadium!  It is crowded trying to enter the stadium but that is because of security and sorting out which gate/line you should be in.  Everything else makes for a wonderful event!
543,Date of experience: October 2015,25-Oct-15,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,Great stadium experience,"Visited for the Florida State vs Georgia Tech football game.  Had a good time tailgating by the Student Center before going inside the historic stadium.  Wow, we were impressed.  The staff were professional and friendly, welcoming each customer to the game.  We had great seats in the upper section on the visitors side.  Looked like there were no bad seats in the house.  Sorry to say FSU lost to the Yellow Jackets but we very much enjoyed the experience.  The only negative was the horrible traffic jam after the game.  Took us over an hour to get from the parking lot back to I-75 South.  Kind of expected that since we were in downtown Atlanta.  Thanks to the GT fans enthusiasm, they earned a win."
544,Date of experience: November 2014,21-Oct-15,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,go yellow jackets!,hubby and i worked at georgia tech and rarely missed a game!  the stadium is awesome and the rush you get while in the stands watching the game is priceless.  don't miss a game if you have the chance!
545,Date of experience: October 2015,20-Oct-15,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,Georgia Tech Football Experience,"I have now sat in both the East and West seats for football games.  Perhaps the East is a little easier to get into your seats, depending on where you park.  The game experience highly depends on those seated around you and the performance of the team.  I can say Tech fans are great.  Wish I could still say the same about the team.  There is a lot of famous history associated with Bobby Dodd Stadium !"
546,Date of experience: October 2015,12-Oct-15,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,Picturesque place to view a college football game,"We went to the Ga. Tech - UNC game during Family Weekend and soaked up the festivities. The band marched through campus and led a large contingent to the stadium entrance. Our seats were high up in the end zone with great views of downtown Atlanta. Stadium was not packed at kickoff but slowly filled in (sitll not a sellout). Minor disappointment was the lack of variety of concession food in our end of the stadium. Every stadium is different and people around us seemed pleasant, even though it was raining and Ga. Tech eventually lost the game. As with many college campuses, game day parking is very expensive. We paid $25 to park on the far end of campus."
548,Date of experience: September 2015,17-Sep-15,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Another great Tech victory,"We attended our second game of the season and watched Tech win over Tulane. It was a great experience and a great game. We could used some more fans watch the Jackets move up the AP poll. It is a wonderful experience at Bobby Dodd Stadium. Although the everything is dated - bathrooms, etc., it is definitely worth going to see this impressive college team and all of the fans."
549,Date of experience: August 2015,15-Sep-15,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,nice stadium,"enjoyable stadium, with a good college vibe. not  large, but a good size to capture the college football experience. nice to see the buildings of Atlanta in the background."
550,Date of experience: September 2015,15-Sep-15,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Great football venue,"A great stadium at a great university.  Set in the city of Atlanta on the campus of Georgia Tech University in a beautiful setting.  Make sure you see the very ""green"" campus in the middle of a great city."
551,Date of experience: October 2014,11-Sep-15,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Fun place to watch a fun college football game - Go Jackets!,"Go Jackets!  This is a great stadium to watch a college football game, not a bad seat in the house and the energy is high.  It's not that easy to get in and out, and finding a place to park close by is impossible.  There are parking garages near Spring Street so it's a bit of a walk. There are typically lots of tailgaters to see along the way, but no tailgating allowed in the parking garages."
552,Date of experience: September 2015,5-Sep-15,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Best CFB Stadium Atmosphere,"Bobby Dodd is just fun. It's not too loud or raucous and the students aren't too drunk or obnoxious. The location in central Atlanta creates a unique game-day atmosphere that can't be missed (although you want to leave the car at home, if possible). Definitely one of CFB's great stadiums."
553,Date of experience: October 2014,30-Aug-15,ACC,Georgia Tech,3,"Nice stadium, too many people",It's a beautiful area but TONS of people and that means big crowds we couldn't find anything. Not to mention we had trouble finding parking. But in the end it was a good trip.
556,Date of experience: November 2014,27-May-15,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Where football was meant to be played,"The oldest Division I stadium in the country, Bobby Dodd Stadium is my favorite place to watch a game. With only 55,000 seats, the stadium is large enough to really feel the excitement but no so big that you are too far away from the action. Under the towering skyline of Atlanta, the night games are better than anywhere in America. Go to a game and see for yourself. Go Jackets!"
558,Date of experience: October 2014,21-Dec-14,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Duke @ Georgia Tech veterans Day,"this was my first ever college football game, wonderful atmosphere before the game, some veterans invited me to join there tailgating and even upgraded my tickets for me which was amazing, had a brilliant time just a shame they lost and the random lightning storm interrupting the game. would definitely watch georgia tech here again the next time i visit atlanta!"
559,Date of experience: November 2014,6-Dec-14,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Great Seats Everywhere,love this stadium. We sat in the endzone and still enjoyed the game.  Not really a bad seat anywhere.  nice Atlanta skyline in the background. Easy access from several locations around Atlanta and the school. historic and well maintained
560,Date of experience: October 2014,9-Oct-14,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Great college atmosphere,"My daughter is a senior at Tech and a member of the marching band. We've been coming to all the games for four years. This past Saturday (10/4/14) was a night game versus Miami. Big game, great crowd, fantastic time. No bad seats in this stadium. Great tradition with over 100 years of playing football here."
561,Date of experience: October 2013,4-May-14,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,History,Great place to watch a game. Get there early if it's the Ga/Ga Tech game. Had to have my tickets validated once to prove I had the valid tickets and remove several people who had bought counterfeit tickets. Small venue but cool with the Atlanta skyline all around you.
562,Date of experience: November 2013,2-Jan-14,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Nothing but good views from Bobby Dodd stadium.,"We loved the atmosphere and the sight lines from this stadium.  There isn't a bad seat in the house.  The concessions are nothing to write home about and they don't serve alcohol (unless you're in the club section or a suite).  The fans around us were all nice and very into the game, which helped the viewing experience.   The stadium only seats 55,000 so the action is really close.  There are great views of Atlanta from the West or North stands, and it's very pretty during a night game.  I also think it's the oldest FBS on college campus stadium in the USA.  Parking can be scarce but Marta is an easy walk to the stadium."
563,Date of experience: November 2013,13-Nov-13,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,Easy Access for a Major College Stadium,"I saw my first game in Bobby Dodd after living in the Atlanta area for 30 years.  I did not attend Tech so I am totally impartial.  The stadium is a short walk from the North Ave MARTA station, and I discovered there is a walking tunnel that goes under the highway and right to the stadium.There are great views of downtown Atlanta from the stadium and its even better at night. The fans were more respectful than most other college venues I've been to.  After the game it was quite easy to exit - good flow from all the exits and a short walk back to the MARTA station."
564,Date of experience: November 2013,3-Nov-13,ACC,Georgia Tech,4,Awesome skyline views,"Home of the Jackets, BDS is unique for major college football stadiums as it is located right in the middle of the city, offering great views of Atlanta from the upper decks.  Grab your gold and cheer on the Jackets for a great Atlanta experience"
565,Date of experience: November 2012,16-Aug-13,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Great Location to Watch College Football!,"I'll start by saying that I am a little partial since I am a GT grad.  However, my review can be backed up by non GT fans.  Bobby Dodd stadium is neat place to watch a college football game.  It is located right in the middle of Atlanta.  You can see the Atlanta skyline while watching a Tech game at Bobby Dodd stadium.  It has a very intimate feel when watching a game.  I have friends that currently go to Tech games just to watch a college football game since their school or team is miles away.  There is nothing special about the concessions that sets this stadium apart from other stadiums, but the game watching experience is great!"
566,Date of experience: September 2012,6-Jun-13,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,"Go, Jackets!","Be sure to see a game at the Bobby Dodd stadium.  School spirit is strong, and the stadium is both comfortable and has great field visibility from every seat."
567,Date of experience: November 2012,22-May-13,ACC,Georgia Tech,3,The smallish size is the best part!,"This is an older stadium without many of the ammenities of the newer stadiums.  That said, it's small size makes up for it's shortcomings as there really isn't a bad seat in the house.  It almost never sells out, you can buy tix on the street for most games at below face value."
569,Date of experience: October 2012,22-Mar-13,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Yellow Jackets Rule,"This is a great place to attend a college football game. Try to arrive early, parking can be a problem. Plan to eat at the Varsity on game day."
570,Date of experience: November 2012,25-Feb-13,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,YELLOW JACKET HEAVEN,Great place to watch a game. Not too big. Not a bad seat in the house. Concessions very reasonable. Rest rooms were clean. Had a wonderful time.
571,Date of experience: November 2012,13-Feb-13,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Greatest stadium in America,"Where do we start? Oldest D1 stadium in America. Rich in history, tradition and integrity. On the campus of Georgia Tech which is the top school for students from all over the world."
572,Date of experience: October 2012,11-Feb-13,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Yellow Jackets,If you are into college football this is a must.  Home of the Tech Yellow Jackets.  The team isn't that great but the stadium is awesome.
573,Date of experience: September 2012,11-Dec-12,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Best Place to See a College Football Game,Not too big to get a real feel for the action!!  At night you can see all the lights of Atlanta and there is not a bad seat in the whole stadium.
575,Date of experience: September 2012,30-Oct-12,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Fun Afternoon of Football,"I took the family earlier this fall to watch the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets battle the Miami (FLA) Hurricanes. Bobby Dodd Stadium is an EXCELLENT place to watch football...so much so, I'd bet even a Georgia fan would admit to this!Prior to the game, we grabbed a bite to eat close to the stadium, then strolled through the tailgates towards the stadium. The atmosphere was safe and family friendly and the fans were well behaved while having fun.Inside the stadium, we sat in the east upper deck. I quickly realized there's not a bad seat in the house considering how close the stands are to the field. For those of you who've seen a game at Notre Dame, you'll know what I mean.Please note: The east stands receive the brunt of the afternoon sun. So if you prefer shady seats, look to the west stands or the south end zone. Regarding seats, Georgia Tech football tickets  are pretty easy to come by. First, try Stub Hub for the best deals.Give the Jackets a try. I bet you'll have a great time, even if the team on the field isn't the greatest."
578,Date of experience: September 2012,20-Sep-12,ACC,Georgia Tech,3,Saturday afternoon GT football game,"We visited Bobby Dodd field for the GT football game vs. Virginia. Spoiler alert- Tech won. The stadium is much smaller than I am used to (roughly 55,000 seats vs. 80,000+). That is not to say that it is bad, just much smaller. This makes for a more intimate experience. Our seats were in the upper deck, but the view of the field was good, and we were able to see all of the action with no problems.They serve standard stadium fare, including Papa Johns pizza (mediocre), nachos, pretzels, popcorn, sandwiches, etc. They also have Sonny's BBQ, pulled pork and pulled chicken, and a few specialty dining options, including some outstanding Mexican that are made to order. Alcohol is not served in the main part of the stadium (it may be served in the suite areas). Soda's run $4.00 for a small. The pizza was $8.00. A burrito was around $7.00 or $8.00. Prices are comparable to other college stadium venues.Two complaints, first the ramps to access the upper level seating area are at an extreme angel. Seniors or people with disabilities may find the walk extremely cumbersome.My second complaint involves the security at the venue. When escorting coaches to the elevators, security runs through the concourse yelling at people to move. In fact we saw one gentlemen get shoved out of the way and into a concrete pole. This occurred toward the end of halftime.One final though, the view from the stadium is outstanding. The Atlanta skyline is in the distance, and you have a great view of the surrounding buildings, both on campus and off campus."

582,Date of experience: November 2011,5-Apr-12,ACC,Georgia Tech,3,Cold and Windy,"We saw a Georgia Tech game and the game and the show was very good, however it was very windy and cold this day and we could not stay until the end."
587,Date of experience: November 2011,2-Jan-12,ACC,Georgia Tech,1,Old and Nasty,"Nasty old stadium with crowded corridors and fire trap regress. Horrific restroom facilities, and generic ball park food that doesn't change from vendor to vendor. Never again."
589,Date of experience: October 2011,15-Nov-11,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Lots of History: great football,"worth a stop and look even if your not a Yellow Jacket.  Oldest campus stadium in DI.  Second oldest in all college football.  lots of famous feet have trod the grass down below, including John Heisman as a coach for years.  Right in middle of campus.  across street from Tech's newest diner.  Spend a half day or full day.  Get some cheap tickets and spend the weekend.  Might fall in love with one of the best academic institutions in the world."
590,Date of experience: September 2010,12-Feb-11,ACC,Georgia Tech,5,Great Stadium,Great historical Stadium.  Not like the cookie cutter stadiums at other places.  beautiful views of downtown.
599,Date of experience: January 2023,15-Jan-23,ACC,Miami,3,Had Good Food Choices,"I am trying to make my way to all of the NFL stadiums. This is my 9th stadium visited. I would say this one doesn??t rate high on that list. This is because outside of the stadium is pretty bland and once you enter the stadium it is pretty bland. As you walk around to find food, it is lots of concrete and not much color or other fan activities. Once inside the actual bowl of the stadium it is pretty. Bright teal seats, big tvs in the corners, and a good view from about anywhere."
600,Date of experience: January 2023,9-Jan-23,ACC,Miami,4,Nice modern stadium,"Very cool stadium . Lots of food and beverage choices . 200 level had great views . Unless you want sun , don??t sit on visitors side . Same goes for 100s. Park in yellow 13,14 for quick exit."
601,Date of experience: December 2022,26-Dec-22,ACC,Miami,5,Nice stadium,Parking was easy but a walk. Stadium was nice and partially covered. Even on level 300 end zone had a good view of the game.
602,Date of experience: November 2022,5-Dec-22,ACC,Miami,2,"Terrible transportation pickups, signage, and stadium personell customer service","The location of this stadium is terrible. We hired a driver to pick us up after the Pitt-Miami game after hearing there is no location to have a ride-share pick you up. The driver told us a crossroads of two streets to pick us up. The signage in this stadium is awful! Not only that, but we asked at least 5 different employees how to get to this location and every one of them gave us opposite directions. We walked, and walked, and walked so much we all had blisters. Finally, we saw a police car and walked across a parking lot and asked her where the location was, she didn't know and flagged down another cop car and he didn't either! It was bizarre, finally someone walking by showed us it was around the corner of where the cop cars were parked! This was all after midnight and if I were by myself or with just one other person I would feel very unsafe."
603,Date of experience: November 2022,29-Nov-22,ACC,Miami,5,Awesome time,"The stadium is clean , variety of food. The fans are friendly. Very up beat stadium. The only issue is ride share. It is a walk."
605,Date of experience: October 2022,24-Oct-22,ACC,Miami,2,Nice stadium. Horrible rideshare organization.,"Amenities in the stadium were very nice. They did a great job with the renovation. Aweaome place to watch a football game. My main issue is with their rideshare organization. There is absolutely 0. You would figure such a large stadium would have dedicated signage and a lot for drop off and for people to get an uber or lyft after the event. This is not the case. Plan to wait two hours after your event to get a ride home. Because of this, I will most likely not return to this venue."
606,Date of experience: December 2021,20-Oct-22,ACC,Miami,5,Wonderful Orange Bowl Experience,"Went on New Years Eve with my 14 year old daughter to see Michgan play n the Orangle Bowl. Although the game didn't go our way, the stadium is spectacular.The open air concept is wonderful as the weather was perfect in late December. Yes like all stadiums the food and drink are expensive. The food was better than most stadiums I have been to so take some comfort in the prices you are paying. Restrooms were clean and stocked. Escalators and elevators are available if you don't want to walk up the ramp to get to the top. We parked at a local casino down the road and there are free shuttles taking you to the stadium. We actually walked to the game and it was under 15 minutes and very safe. Rode the shutlle back as it was getting late. Plenty of buses so a very short wait."
607,Date of experience: October 2022,17-Oct-22,ACC,Miami,5,Home of my Dolphins,"First time at ""The Rock"", first Dolphins home game for us. It was easy to get to the stadium from our hotel in Hollywood. There was also a quick and easy get in/out from Parking Lot 14.The stadium looks amazing, outside and inside. Seats are comfortable and even if you are on the high seating sections, you can clearly see the game.I must say that every employee that we met or interacted with, treated us with a smile, were attentive, and cordial.Prices at the team store are higher than online stores. Concession prices are as expected on a venue like this. I must say that I enjoyed going to the game and I can't wait to come back."
608,Date of experience: October 2022,17-Oct-22,ACC,Miami,2,Awful Parking!,"The parking experience was a mess!  We bought the online parking with is apparently required, and ending up parking in a lot at least a mile away. It was gravel, dirty, and getting out was the worst I've ever seen. We even saw one idiot run into another and they got into a fight. Terrible experience!!"
609,Date of experience: October 2022,11-Oct-22,ACC,Miami,5,dolphins game,amazing experience watching football.  staff was great and the food and rinks were amazingly good.  seats were incredible
611,Date of experience: September 2022,26-Sep-22,ACC,Miami,3,Brutally Hot,Not having a dome or playing early games at night is unfair to fans. I felt faint and had to go to concession area several times to go under fans. They don??t even sell Gatorade or Powerade- only water in an aluminum bottle. Yuk!  I don??t plan to go to a game here again.
612,Date of experience: September 2022,26-Sep-22,ACC,Miami,4,Needs a roof,"The stadium recently had a major renovation but missed probably the most important thing, a retractable roof. Miami's weather is very likely to get rain, lightning, and other storms that can affect the ongoing event which can lead to a long pause or a full cancelation. Besides that there are good food and beverage options, comfortable seating and nice decoration."
615,Date of experience: September 2022,21-Sep-22,ACC,Miami,4,Hard rock stadium,The stadium is well located and accessible. The activity flew organized and the place looks safe. I noted parking rate higher than similar arenas .
616,Date of experience: September 2022,18-Sep-22,ACC,Miami,1,Trashy venue with very trashy and abusive security,"Tragically terrible venue for anything outside of sporting events. Extremely unprofessional and devastatingly poorly-trained security. I was manhandled instead of being told I was walking the wrong way. An emergency was announced and we were instructed to take cover due to lightning. Lightning began crashing down extremely close to the venue. While seeking my nearest exit, this ??security guard?? tried putting his hands on me instead of using words to direct me. Never in my life had I been touched like that. Shame on Hard Rock Stadium for their abusive security. It seemed like this man was wanting to get physical. It was shocking! I don??t know if he targeted me since I??m a smaller woman but he didn??t do so with another man who also had gone the wrong way and was adjacent to me trying to seek cover. Aside from that traumatic experience, I paid $500+ for seats where during the show there was no order. Anyone could stand anywhere. Aisles were not clear. Security guards were inconsistent with policies. A beverage concession set up in front of our floor seats. Our front row view became a line of people waiting for alcohol in front of us. Unsafe conditions with exit routes being blocked and not being able to safely move guests. Truly the worst venue I've ever seen a show at. Their least concern is the safety of their guests. You couldn't pay me enough to come back."
617,Date of experience: September 2022,12-Sep-22,ACC,Miami,4,Dolphins Game,"I went to the Dolphins home opener yesterday and tailgated for a couple hours before the game.  The atmosphere is very welcoming, there's people offering food and throwing footballs to you.  The shaded seats are also pretty nice since it is very hot in Florida.  The only thing bad about the stadium is that leaving the parking lot can take a long time, About an hour or two.  Worth themoney."
618,Date of experience: September 2022,11-Sep-22,ACC,Miami,2,Why oh why....never again!!!!!!,"Why, oh why, isn't this parking lot 42.. moving after 2 hrs...why!!!!!!!!!!!!Sitting here after a fun day of football in parking lot 42 for hours.Noone is moving.Noone is moving.Noone is moving.Why,why,why.Watch the game on tv!!!!!!"
619,Date of experience: August 2022,1-Sep-22,ACC,Miami,4,Very helpful staff,The staff I encountered were all very helpful. The drinks were reasonably priced and there were lots of locations so not too long of lineups. There is at least one phone charging station for a fee but you still have to have juice left in your phone 'cause you need an app. The bathroom line moved fast which means they have several. The trek to get to Uber at the Walmart is way too far and needs to be brought in closer which is also for safety reasons.
620,Date of experience: August 2022,27-Aug-22,ACC,Miami,1,"Horrible parking experience, never again","Total chaos in and out of the parking, one and an half hours to get in and crazy 2 and an half to get out. I will never come back. Worst than third world, never saw this before, absolutely no organization, simply chaos, unbelievable, cars in all directions, never, never again."
622,Date of experience: October 2021,30-Dec-21,ACC,Miami,5,Great venue to catch the games,"This was a no frills, game day experience. We were warned ahead of time that transportation to/from the stadium would be difficult. We ended up reserving a ride ahead of time, which worked out well. We ended up getting dropped off a quick walk from the stadium. Miami has their share of eclectic fans, which was a fun experience. Walking through the tailgates wasn't as contentious as you would have expected - their fans truly go all-out.There wasn't really anything about the stadium that stood out, it was easy to get drinks/food whenever you needed. The weather was amazing and had pretty good seats for a decent price."
623,Date of experience: December 2021,9-Dec-21,ACC,Miami,4,"First NFL game, great time!","First time ever to an NFL game, had a blast! The stadium looks great. Easy to get in and find our seats. Friendly staff. People should keep it clean taking their trash after the game. Only downside, had to walk long distance to parking, but it was free."
624,Date of experience: December 2020,16-Nov-21,ACC,Miami,3,Fun Time!,"Fun stadium, easy to get too. Coming from a visiting team, the atmosphere was still a good time. Worth making a vacation out of"
625,Date of experience: November 2021,13-Nov-21,ACC,Miami,1,Too much alcohol. People drink outside and enter the stadium WASTED.,"Went to a Dolphins game Nov 11, 2021. Drunk fans just behind us, were EXTREMELY loud screaming their lungs out. We had to leave at midgame. They reeked of alcohol. Unacceptable behavior and security did not address that. Not  a place to take my kids. Parking and food overpriced."
626,Date of experience: November 2021,12-Nov-21,ACC,Miami,4,Visitor for ftbl game,I haven't been to Hard Rock Stadium in about 5 years. The upgrade is noticeable.  No problem with the lines to get in. The staff made sure everyone was informed before going in regarding rules.  Food variety is ok. The quickest woman bathroom line in all my nfl stadium visits across the USA.
627,Date of experience: November 2021,12-Nov-21,ACC,Miami,4,Get an early start getting here,"Get club seats if you happen to attend a football game here.  The seat was reasonably comfortable and there??s easy access to bathrooms and food.  The food is INCREDIBLY expensive for ballpark food.  I had a burger, fries, and Pepsi for $35.  It was good but not that good.  Head to the stadium early, parking is hell here due to the construction."
628,Date of experience: October 2021,29-Oct-21,ACC,Miami,5,What a sports venue,Had club seats for a Dolphins game. What a great stadium. Easy to get in and out of. Comfortable seats and great views.
629,Date of experience: September 2021,25-Sep-21,ACC,Miami,1,Chaotic experience!,Unfortunately this stadium used to be easy to get to and to park safely and a fun stress free experience! . I went by charter bus prior to the Covid lockdown and it took us almost 2 hours to get out of the parking lot. I have friends who attended games this year and it was an absolute nightmare! Having Fans walk 20 minutes in the dark to try to get a ride share/ Uber /Lyft shows the new management doesn??t care about their fans. It??s dangerous with the traffic and you would think the stadium/ Dolphins would promote safe driving. Unfortunately they don??t care. It??s become the most chaotic Stadium in the Country . It??s so sad when profit outweighs safety protocols for loyal fans!
630,Date of experience: September 2021,25-Sep-21,ACC,Miami,1,"Hopeless , Mean spirited , stupidly over priced .",Train staff to know where lyft and Uber pick up points are. They knew nothing. Make more pick-up  locations  available. It's 90 degrees and one shouldn't have to walk 0.5 Miles to meet a car outside the stadium.
631,Date of experience: September 2021,22-Sep-21,ACC,Miami,3,Even the 300s where good,"We were recently here from out of town to check out the Miami Dolphins game. The parking here was pretty easy. We had bought a Yellow Parking Lot pass and that worked out really nicely. The fans we ran into all seemed good and were their for a fun time. The walk from the lot to the stadium was only about 10 minutes. You could fly through security, they really had things streamlined. The stadium was clean and decently updated. What I was very surprised with was the great view we had from our seats in 303. The atmosphere in the stadium was average, I wouldn't put it at the top of the stadiums I've visited, but it was a friendly place for us neutral fans."
632,Date of experience: September 2021,21-Sep-21,ACC,Miami,3,No more standing room only,The standing room only sections in the corners of the end zones on the upper deck have been taken away we never went to our seats we always stayed there now they are gone what a huge disappointment
633,Date of experience: September 2021,20-Sep-21,ACC,Miami,4,Worth a visit,Very nice and clean stadium.  We were on the Club level and had an incredible array of food options to choose from.  Only complaint is the prices were exorbitant!!Parking was easy and we were surprised how quickly we were able to leave after the game.
634,Date of experience: September 2021,12-Sep-21,ACC,Miami,5,Great Stadium,We go here often for Canes games and continue to be impressed. We were worried the construction would make parking/entry more difficult but we were pleasantly surprised to find that this wasn??t the case. Clean bathrooms and relatively reasonable concession prices (for a stadium). We refilled our water bottles with the water fountains and the water was pretty good - no metallic or dirty taste that you frequently get from water fountains. Every stadium employee we??ve encountered is pleasant and friendly. Can??t wait for our next visit to watch our Canes!
638,Date of experience: January 2021,19-Jan-21,ACC,Miami,5,Football Championship,Even with Covid this was a terrific trip. The crowd was amazing as well as the staff and the process of getting everyone in and out safely. Overall terrific venue.
639,Date of experience: January 2021,3-Jan-21,ACC,Miami,5,Spectacular Orange Bowl - A shout-out to Floridians,"Our experience at the Orange Bowl was one that deserves a shout-out to the workers, stadium staff, and Gov DeSantis for allowing the public to enjoy the game, safely.  The stadium staff were so friendly and welcoming - from the security guards, ticket takers, concession workers, restroom attendants, and ushers. They monitored and enforced the wearing of masks, social distancing and the stadium was immaculate.  There was a good variety of food choices, and it wasn??t all fried foods. Kudos to Florida and your hospitality."
640,Date of experience: December 2020,18-Dec-20,ACC,Miami,5,Great experience!,"Always a great place to go. Been there for several events, this was the first time for a Dolphin game (during a pandemic). Felt safe and welcome from the start. Everyone was so helpful and friendly. The seat spacing is perfect, they make sure is everyone is wearing their masks. All areas were clean. I can't say enough about what a great job they all do and thanks for a great experience! Can't wait to go back."
641,Date of experience: October 2020,6-Oct-20,ACC,Miami,4,Dolphins Game,Recently attended a Dolphins game. Impressed with the Covid protocols put in place for all. Very pleasant experience considering.
643,Date of experience: August 2019,20-Jul-20,ACC,Miami,5,Miami Dolphins versus Atlanta Falcons,"Went twice in one week and the place is great.  All the entertainment was superb and the kids loved being there.  The shop is superb and worth a visit, and the food halls have fantastic variety."
647,Date of experience: December 2019,16-Feb-20,ACC,Miami,4,Battle for Burrow,"The stadium was easy to find. I recommend that if you search for directions, make sure your settings are on to avoid tolls because there are many tolls in Miami. The stadium staff was incredibly nice. I look forward to returning."
648,Date of experience: January 2020,14-Feb-20,ACC,Miami,5,Attended Super Bowl 54,"This stadium is user-friendly. Food concessions and toilets are convenient. Food and drink options are better than most ""stadium food"" options. The employees were very friendly and helpful."
656,Date of experience: December 2019,22-Jan-20,ACC,Miami,3,Orange Bowl,Loved being able to come to a college football bowl game!  It had been on our bucket list.  The stadium was very nice but we had a few hiccups.  First we bought the unlimited popcorn about half way through the game and when we went to fill...still a lot of time left they told us they were out of popcorn??? how does that happen.  Second I ordered a wine and he told me he had no glasses so I said I would drink it out of a glass like my daughter received for her mixed drink but apparently those are only for mixed drinks so I said I will take any glass but he said he had none and handed me my little bottle of wine.  Haha Good think I am not a classy gal!
657,Date of experience: December 2019,22-Jan-20,ACC,Miami,4,Way Cool!!,"My son & I made the trip for the Eagles--Dolphins game (Ugh, the Eagles lost.) and we came away thinking that the stadium was WAY Cool!!  On first sight, the stadium was bathed in Awesome colors and it was very easy to get around on the concourse.  The overhang was a nice plus because You could see it coming into play for certain weather conditions.  The stadium was clean, our seats were comfortable, for a stadium, and our sight lines were good.  We Ubered there and so we didn't have to pay for parking, a good thing, but getting to a convenient Uber pick-up was a hassle.  We would recommend a game visit to the Hard Rock Stadium."
658,Date of experience: December 2019,7-Jan-20,ACC,Miami,3,Ms,"Whoa, parking was $50.00 for the Dolphins game. Other than that,  had a great time. Easy to get around the stadium. Clean."
659,Date of experience: December 2019,2-Jan-20,ACC,Miami,4,Beautiful Stadium,"Went there for the Orange Bowl.  Loved everything about the stadium except the cost of the concessions and parking for buses.  Was a member of a group with multiple buses that required a 20 minute walk to the stadium which was difficult for the elderly and disabled fans in our group.  Loved the pregame tailgate party set up for the Teams at the stadium.  The bathrooms were clean, sound system/video board was good, and seats were comfortable."
660,Date of experience: December 2019,2-Jan-20,ACC,Miami,5,Nice Venue,Nice venue. We went to a Bengals - Dolphins game and of course it rained and we stayed dry due to the overhang.
662,Date of experience: December 2019,3-Dec-19,ACC,Miami,5,Great day out,Visited on day the Eagles were in town. Great atmosphere in the stadium and a fantastic game. The whole place is geared to giving you a fantastic day out and plenty to eat and drink. Had a fantastic day.
663,Date of experience: December 2019,1-Dec-19,ACC,Miami,2,Dolphins need to control fans,I went to the Miami Dolphins Game vs. Philadelphia Eagles game at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. We had 10 seats in section 129. Paid about $200.00 per seat. The family came in from Philadelphia for the game so we decided to get good seats. Fans in front of us standing up and holding signs the entire game. Ended up watching the game on the jumbo screens vs the players on the screen......next time will stay home!
664,Date of experience: November 2019,27-Nov-19,ACC,Miami,4,Impressive,"Having never been to a major football stadium, we wanted to have a look at this one.  It was impressive from the outside, but otherwise they don't let you see much.  We did find a place we could drive in, but were given strict instructions that we could only go to the team store.  It would be nice if they had a place you could see more without having to buy something."
665,Date of experience: November 2019,25-Nov-19,ACC,Miami,4,Dolphins v Jets football game,"Nice stadium. I was carrying a straw purse, not super small but smaller than average. I thought they would just open the bag, rifle through the contents at the entry point, and passe through but they wouldn't allow me to bring the purse into the stadium. They gave me a plastic bag, into which I had to empty the contents of my purse, and the purse was thrown out! The only choice was to walk somewhere in the distance and check it and then retrieve it after the game.  This over the top security policy dampened our enjoyment and seemed somewhat unreasonable. So,warning to future attendees, keep your necessary item either in your pockets or in a tiny pouch or else it will be taken from you."
666,Date of experience: November 2019,23-Nov-19,ACC,Miami,3,The Good and The Bad,"The Good:The upper bowl is covered by an overhang which came in handy when it rained during the game. The price for a burger and fries was around 11 dollars, which was a very good price for stadium food.The stadium was very clean and looks like they put some work into making it look nice. The Bad:Parking cost $50 and we werent even parked on pavement. They charged $50 dollars for parking and then parked us near the canal in the dirt. They don't allow drawstring bags in. I have never been to a sporting event that did not allow drawstring bags in. Every other venue would search the bag and you would be good to go. They did not have the prices or menus displayed for the food stands and when I tried to order a po'boy they said they didn't have the ingredients. Overall it was a decent experience but they could make some improvements."
667,Date of experience: November 2019,21-Nov-19,ACC,Miami,5,Enjoy the game!!,"This is the first time we attended a Dolphins game at the Hard Rock stadium. It was easy to find, parking was good, the stadium was clean and the staff helpful. The beer was cold too!Too bad the Dolphins did not win the game. Maybe next time!"
668,Date of experience: November 2019,19-Nov-19,ACC,Miami,5,Great Experience,"Want to give a shout out to the Hard Rock and there dedicate staff for a wonderfully first class experience watching Miami Dolphins play the Buffalo Bills.Very easy to negotiate everything from parking to seating and exiting.Very nice staff all around and the fans were alot of fun ,jingeling with each other no matter what team you were rooting for.A delight to see.Love Florida s laid back attitude"
669,Date of experience: October 2019,27-Oct-19,ACC,Miami,5,AWESOME!,"We visited Hard Rock Stadium twice. Once for a NFL game and once to watch the Miami Hurricans in the NCAA. Both were great experiences. They differ a bit; the good seats are a lot cheaper for the college games, and also the atmosphere, pregame show and such were better. The level of football was waaay better in the NFL game though."
672,Date of experience: October 2019,13-Oct-19,ACC,Miami,5,Best stadium in Collegiate and Professional Athletics,"Ok, maybe I am a bit biased as I am a die hard Miami Hurricanes and Miami Dolphins fan but this stadium is incredible. From the beauty of it when you first see it appear in the distance to the amenities when you're cheering your team on it's hard to beat. Easily the best food and drink options out of any stadium (though very expensive) and the covered seating is clutch in the brutal South Florida heat. 4 giant big screens around the stadium make missing the action darn near impossible. With new walkways, bridges and tunnels for fans its safer than ever and plenty of merchandise and interactive zones make this the best game day experience."
673,Date of experience: October 2019,11-Oct-19,ACC,Miami,2,Ride sharing difficulties = many drunk drivers,"Although the stadium is quite modern and full of amenities, the management of Hard Rock Stadium did a huge disservice to it??s patrons by making ride-sharing services a pain in the neck (or rather feet) to partake in. To take an Uber or Lyft, one must walk blocks to a local elementary school. In the meantime, the taxis are located at the SE gate and attempt to cheat passengers with ??flat fares??, cash only, and unwillingness to use their meters. Expect to encounter plenty of drunk drivers with the parameters put in place."
674,Date of experience: October 2019,9-Oct-19,ACC,Miami,5,Great Stadium,"Saw the Hurricanes on 10/5/19.  Stadium was clean, new, safe, easy to get in and out of and we never stood in line more than 5 min for anything we needed.  West side tailgate scene was great.  It's just a really nice stadium.  Wish the score line was different, but had a great time."
675,Date of experience: October 2019,9-Oct-19,ACC,Miami,5,Beautiful Stadium,"Bring a clear purse to get through security. Section 223 is at the club level, which is really nice but is in the sun for a 3:30 game and gets really hot, so wear your sunscreen!"
676,Date of experience: September 2019,7-Oct-19,ACC,Miami,5,One of best stadiums I've been to,"We went to the Dolphins vs Chargers game (Dolphins lost) When we arrived the car park as shown in the picture was full of pickup trucks and people had set up gazebos. It looked like a car boot sale with food and drink. A local fan explained this was the ""Tail Gate Party"" they arrived at family atmosphere, kids played games and everyone was friendly. The stadium was one of the best I have ever been to. Plenty of toilets no queues. Loads of food outlets, helpful staff. It is not a cheap day, tickets cost $50 dollars in the ""Gods"" to $500 plus. As the stadium is hosting the SuperBowl next year tickets will be between $5,000 50 over $20,000. Thoroughly enjoyed it."
677,Date of experience: September 2019,6-Oct-19,ACC,Miami,2,Disorganised,"So we arrived and I had to get rid of my bag as it was too big. You can only take in a bag the size of your hand... nowhere to get any shade outside and no stands for people who don't have their own vehicles and tailgate parties. Pretty easy getting through security and beers being sold for 11 dollars each. Expensive! Food also over priced but good portions and quite tasty. Game was good although hard to hear the commentary at times. I've marked this down badly as after the match it was really disorganised. We got told different things by several different people about where to get uber's and taxis from so were walking around for ages. Found a taxi sign and got into the queue but there was no shade and it was 40 degrees. We saw three people keel over. We queued for about half hour then a police woman came and said no taxis would come there so we were fuming. We had to walk for half hour in the baking sun to Walmart where we just happened to stumble across a taxi and jumpped in it but there were loads of other people still waiting so God knows how they got home. It was a real shambles. The need to sort it out, put up proper signage and have a taxi or uber system."
678,Date of experience: August 2019,29-Sep-19,ACC,Miami,1,Almost a joke,"They sell handicap parking on line with numbered spaces, but when you arrive there is no such thing. Really? Security is run by children, what a joke. Really! They are suppose to have gourmet food, its not, its just gourmet prices. Crowd control is stupid, well no its not, there just isn't any. And when you leave........you can be out of the parking lot in less than 2 hours! Never again!"
679,Date of experience: September 2019,29-Sep-19,ACC,Miami,5,Miami Dolphins Game,Such a great experience!  Get seats on the home side so you are in the shade. Arrive early so you and the kids get to have fun in the Family Fun Zone before you even head into the stadium!  It is truly and experience not just watching a game. Buy your parking in advance to help you take the stress out of arriving.
681,Date of experience: September 2019,26-Sep-19,ACC,Miami,5,Miami Dolphins,"We loved this placein the UK we are rugby league fans but this experience was something else!the pre-match 'tailgate party' was crazy, people pitch up in the car park with gazebos, BBQ s, pop up bars, beer pong, games, musicthere is also entertainment and bars before you enter with your ticketonce inside there are so many bars and places to eat including craft beers/ales etc (didn't have cider though) the only downside was everything closes before the end of the game so you cant really hang around for longthe game was the first in the season v Baltimore Ravens who won by a mileas there is literally NO public transport here we took taxis which worked out at ??45 versus the Uber we used to get there which was half the price"
682,Date of experience: September 2019,22-Sep-19,ACC,Miami,4,"Nice Stadium, roomy and lots of food options!","Awesome stadium, great food, parking is a nightmere though only downside... :(....review is only of an NFL game as well..."
683,Date of experience: September 2019,18-Sep-19,ACC,Miami,4,Excellent stadium,"We came here for recent Patriots Dolphins game and very impressed, comfortable stadium with decent access (we came in by taxi) and simple security with no real waits. We had seats in club level which was honestly fantastic with nice bathrooms, great food options and more. Shame they were very limited with wine selection but we did get to meet Jonathon Kraft wandering around the lounge :)Temperature inside wasn't too bad even with roof open as sides allow for reasonable breeze.We left a bit early as blowout to get Uber but no signs and conflicting information about where the lot really is, we never found it as hit busy road and were able to get a taxi."
684,Date of experience: September 2019,16-Sep-19,ACC,Miami,5,Beautiful stadium!,"The hubby and I came for the Dolphins vs. Patriots game.  The stadium was really nice!  Even though it wasn't a complete dome, the temperature wasn't bad at all for a 1:00 pm game.  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves!"
685,Date of experience: September 2019,11-Sep-19,ACC,Miami,4,Gameday / Event tips,"The recently renovated stadium offers a fantastic experience for all budgets. The typical ??standard type?? of concessions are well prepared and offer a good variety of choice selections. On every level, within short distance you??ll find specialized boutique style food and drink vendors  from some quality brands. There??s literally too many to list. Explore and your sure to find something you??ll love. On the NW ??72 club?? 100 level side you??ll find premium eats and a sports bar with lots of screens if you want to take a break from the action at your seats. Depending on the event, keep weather in mind. It gets hot in south Florida. There are several seating selection choices at various price levels that offer air conditioned ??club lounges?? inclusive with the seat, which can be a lifesaver at an afternoon football game, for example. The stadium is pretty clean and the staff is very polite, helpful and ready to answer questions. I gave four stars because leaving the venue can be a hassle, but that??s typical of any event with a large crowd. From what I understand the venue is continually working on  parking and egress related issues to find ways to better flow the exiting folks safely. Uber or car service is a good option to get in and out quickly."
686,Date of experience: September 2019,10-Sep-19,ACC,Miami,5,Game On!,"I went at the Hard Rock Stadium to watch a football game, which team I was cheer for lose, but still had a great time. The Stadium provided a lot of security and guest service assistance, which I did not need but all around (Thank You). The pre-game shows and activities before the game was good. The seat location (Lower Level) was a good view for me and staff in the area was helpful, excited and happy."
689,Date of experience: August 2019,4-Sep-19,ACC,Miami,5,NIce Venue!,Lots of food and drink options! The golf cart rides from the parking areas saved my experience! Great call!
690,Date of experience: August 2019,3-Sep-19,ACC,Miami,4,Great Venue with Excellent Staff and Support!!,"I just had the sublime pleasure of seeing The Rolling Stones at this venue. Entry was easy and things were reasonably well-marked but the excellent event staff made it a breeze to get our wristbands and get to our seats. The sound quality was excellent, likely due to the production staff of The Stones and our excellent seats (section D, floor), but I??ve been to plenty of other shows and had similar seats and the sound quality was crap. I??m giving the venue four stars because 1) I??m still elated from the show and 2) the event staff really was stellar. The one thing that wasn??t: the post-show transportation arrangements. We had to walk nearly five miles, mostly in a circle, for over two hours to get an Uber back to our hotel. It??s not necessarily the venue??s fault for that but the event planners really could have made more robust arrangements to handle the sheer amount of people who needed transportation home. Both my mum and I currently are dealing with mobility issues and absolutely no one from the staff was able to/did offer any assistance. I??ll definitely go to more shows there but now I know to pre-plan all transportation."
692,Date of experience: December 2018,2-Jul-19,ACC,Miami,4,It's Finally Approaching the Fun of the Old Orange Bowl,"When the stadium was first built, those of us who are old time Canes and Fins fans lamented its sterility -- the crowd was too far from the field. But the renovations have changed that, and a few years ago, when the Canes trounced Notre Dame, the venue showed it can be AS electric as the Orange Bowl on a Saturday night."
694,Date of experience: December 2018,24-Jun-19,ACC,Miami,5,Party Stadium,Beautiful Stadium in an up-and-coming community. Many places to shop and grab a quick bite to eat. Walmart is conveniently across the street too.
695,Date of experience: October 2018,7-Jun-19,ACC,Miami,5,Great Stadium!,We went to see the Peru-Chile game... and our tickets were upgraded to the suites... the restaurant inside... just great... great game... great location....
697,Date of experience: September 2018,30-Apr-19,ACC,Miami,5,The BEST stadium located in my Front Yard,"The first time I've ever visited this stadium was in September 2018 when my stepmom and I got invited by a friend of ours who is a professor at the university of Miami to this stadium to see the University of Miami Hurricanes play against FIU Panthers in september 2018, and after the renovations were completed, it is a lot cooler than I thoght. It is so modern on the inside and it has a food court with a huge all-glass window looking outside and offered bottles of water and good food that I didn't eat. The stadium seemed to have 5K TVs which were really cool. The best part is the fact that this is right by my house. I live just 10 minutes from the Hard Rock Stadium It may not be in the best location since it is located in Miami Gardens, but was the best sporting experience I've had since I went with the Miami Lighthouse for the Blind to the Marlin's Park in Little Havana back in 2016 to see the Florida Marlins."
700,Date of experience: November 2018,13-Apr-19,ACC,Miami,5,Very easy in and out stadium,"Still an easy stadiu, to get in and out of and the stadium may be a bit dated but it is fun to see sports the old fashion opened air expereince."
717,Date of experience: December 2018,19-Mar-19,ACC,Miami,3,Miami vs. Jacksonville,"Bought tickets to the Miami vs. Dolphins game for my boyfriend for his birthday. We came in December for Christmas and attended a football game. It was our first NFL live experience. I bought tickets online via ticket master and got the email the day before game day stating everyone in our group had to have e-tickets and to email the tickets to each person in my group. I emailed my boyfriends to him but it did not work correctly and he could not accept it. I could not bring up the bar code for his tickets after emailing it to him. We had a heck of a time trying to get into the game with that issue. Next, I had a small Kate Spade cross body purse big enough for a wallet that was just the size of the paper they go by to judge if you can bring your purse in or not. One employee told me I was not allowed to bring it in. I was not impressed as I had all my ID's and passport in this bag. I was not informed there was a bag check area outside of the field ( I discovered this after the game myself) and almost left to return to our hotel because of all the issues. Thankfully one lady came over and said my purse was fine. It was the most stressful hour trying to work out all the issues but once we got inside we had a great time.They had a lot of merch. to pick from and the staff inside were great. No matter where your seat was I bet the view would be fine. They had people spread out all of the arena aside from the concession stands to get beer quickly. Overall, the experience wasn't bad for our first game."
722,Date of experience: November 2018,27-Jan-19,ACC,Miami,4,Great stadium,Its a nice stadium that hosts lots of games and events. But its far away from the city. You will need a car or uber but it will be expensive one. Its at around 30 minutes on the highway.
724,Date of experience: December 2018,16-Jan-19,ACC,Miami,5,Hard Rock,Recent upgrades to the stadium has made it a great venue to watch a game.  Always look forward to attending a game there!  Great food!  Great sight lines.  Great video boards.
725,Date of experience: December 2018,16-Jan-19,ACC,Miami,5,Amazing experience,"First of all the atmosphere was super! Great people, good beer, friendliness all the way through. There was not a boring minute of the NFL game. I should also mention that the parking (although rather expensive) was super with very easy exit in and out."
726,Date of experience: December 2018,15-Jan-19,ACC,Miami,3,"Very cool venue, poor event execution","I went to Hard Rock Stadium for the Orange Bowl. The stadium itself is awesome. Its big and clean and well branded. We were in the upper deck and still had an awesome view of the field so i think its safe to say there isnt a bad seat in that place. The 'party decks' are tickets that are supposed to come with all inclusive beverages. We bought our tickets directly from the Orange Bowl committee, who confirmed this feature, yet when we got there the attendants at the party deck said they weren't honoring the all inclusive packages. That was half the reason we bought those specific tickets! The other reason I took away a point from the 5 star review was the total lack of visual directions posted when leaving the game. We had to rely on ushers the whole way around the stadium asking where we could get an uber. they directed us to a specific parking lot, when we got there the attendants in the lot directed us to an elementary school nearby, when we got there they directed us back to the lot. We walked for almost 40 minutes until we connected with an uber driver that was willing to wait for us to walk and called us to give step by step directions of where we could be picked up. Thank god for him!!"
728,Date of experience: December 2018,15-Jan-19,ACC,Miami,4,Cool Stadium,"I attended the Orange Bowl between Alabama and Oklahoma. The stadium is very nice, and although my seats were up high, I was still able to have a great time. The bathrooms are plentiful and clean."

Everything here was neat.I went for a game and we had an amazing time. The sound system, the seats, and the prices we got were great. I'm definitely going back and I hope I can take my kids to so they can enjoy because this time I only took my daughter."
732,Date of experience: December 2018,9-Jan-19,ACC,Miami,5,Nice & Relaxing!,"Easy access in and out of the Orange Bowl. Vendors and restrooms well located, great parking and plenty of folks available to help. The only ding was having to go pick up the parking pass at an out of the way location and it did not make it clear when ordering, had to call to find out. Otherwise, great experience!"
733,Date of experience: December 2018,2-Jan-19,ACC,Miami,4,Orange bowl,"A Great stadium to watch a football game, the seats were chair type and good views. They had a lot of good restaurants inside stadium."
734,Date of experience: December 2018,2-Jan-19,ACC,Miami,5,we had a good time in this facility,We attended the 2018 Orange Bowl game. Parking was easy with excellent access for handicapped. The stadium itself is modern and seating areas are covered and offer good views. Concessions are varied and prices not too extreme (we pay more at Redskins games FEDEX field)
735,Date of experience: December 2018,31-Dec-18,ACC,Miami,2,Orange Bowl Catstrophe,"Before I get to the bad stuff, I want to point out the positive.The pregame and game experience was excellent. All stadium employees we encountered during those period were some of the. most helpful and friendly people we have found at a football game.Food and drink selections were also great and diverse. Although whoever there were a few mistakes on the digital boards, for the most part the game experience was solid.However, the postgame experience was unbelievable in a ridiculously bad way.We asked the staff for the best method of transportation back to our hotel. We were told taxi was the best option followed by Uber or Lyft. We chose the taxi line, where we stood for two hours. When we finally got to the front of the line we were told no more taxi were coming. Even worse, we found out most of the people on front of us walked away because they void not get taxis either. So we stood in line for two hours for nothing.Then we walked to a retail center about half a mile away to find hundreds (maybe more) for an opportunity to get an Uber. However, the police had all points of entry into the stadium and surrounding area blocked off. They offered no help for people wandering the area looking for a way home. We encountered screaming, fights, watched drivers threaten each other and more. Eventually we were able to find an Uber driver...four hours after the game ended. Terrible, horrible planning and execution on behalf of be stadium and the city. Of course,If you read other reviews you will find the same. But there is no way to describe the level of disorganization and under disrespect for those who attends the event by whoever is in charge."
736,Date of experience: December 2018,30-Dec-18,ACC,Miami,5,"Great facility, easy to get in and out","I attended 2018 college football semi final. I??m impressed with how easy to park, getting in and out and variety of foods. Foods are quite expensive but good."
737,Date of experience: December 2018,30-Dec-18,ACC,Miami,1,Totally Unprepared for Orange Bowl,"The stadium has the potential to be one of the best, but they were totally unprepared for the Orange Bowl. Parking - I highly recommend paying the extra to park in the black lot. It??s easy in and easy out. We stayed til the end of the game and we??re out of the lot in less than 10 mins. Food - it was absolutely terrible. We went to a private event catered by the stadium and the food wasn??t edible. I didn??t know you could ruin a hot dog but they perfected that. We tried other items in the game and it was equally awful. Avoid the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich at all costs. Drinks - how the heck can the majority of the drink machines be out of soda in the first quarter. Don??t bother buying the refillable drink since they didn??t have soda available for a refill. The mixed drinks were the highest I??ve even seen. $20 for a double of basic alcohol!Security - totally unprepared and beyond confused. Gates opened at 6 and they didn??t even have the metal detectors in place. One metal detector at the club level entrance. Took more than half an out and they were processing about one person per minute. Bathroom - be ready to wait. Not enough restrooms. Stadium video and replay - screens were great but the in game experience was awful. They rarely showed replays and didn??t even have the game playing on the sound system in the common areas, restrooms, etc."
738,Date of experience: December 2018,27-Dec-18,ACC,Miami,4,Easy,"Nice stadium, easy parking. Great views from almost everywhere. The parking was not overpriced, the beer was cold. A great place to see a football game. Oh sit on the home team side for shade."
739,Date of experience: December 2018,21-Dec-18,ACC,Miami,5,Awesome Fan Experience!,"Nice stadium, lots of tailgating. Employees are very friendly and helpful. Security lines moved quickly. Be sure to read stadium rules (which are NFL-wide) of what is and isn't allowed in, such as regulation-size clear bags, etc. Visit Guest Services Headquarters on your level to get a ""First Game"" certificate, and also sign up as a designated driver if you're not planning to drink alcohol, to get a token for a free soda or water. Our seats were very high up, but still had a great view, but quite windy (glad I had a scarf for my neck). There is a partial roof with a big hole in the middle and open sides. So depending on where your seats are, you could still get soaked if it rains, so bring ponchos.  If you don't want to bake in the hot Florida sun, be sure to get tickets on the home side, as visitor side is in full sun for afternoon games."
740,Date of experience: December 2018,12-Dec-18,ACC,Miami,5,Impressive!,My husband and I were in Miami for the Dolphins vs. Bills game. We have never been to a Dolphins game in Miami. We were so impressed with the stadium. It is a beautiful stadium. Statues of the greats around the outside of the stadium. A beautiful garden in front of the stadium. Murals on the walls inside the stadium. So much fun to be had at the stadium before and after the game. We will definitely be going back for more games.
741,Date of experience: December 2018,10-Dec-18,ACC,Miami,1,"Great Stadium, but hard to get out","I surprised my wife for our anniversary, after our cruise, with tickets to watch her favorite football team, the Patriots vs the Dolphins.  The game was played at the Hard Rock Stadium.  It is a great venue, but the employees there need more training in location of there amenities.  We were looking for the ""main"" Dolphins store to purchase souvenirs.  The problem with that is we asked several employees how to get to it and were given the wrong location several times and a couple of employees did not know where it was located.  After doing a lap around the stadium and checking some of the smaller team shops, finally we found a younger Male employee who knew how to get to the main store.  After purchasing our souvenirs we proceeded to ""TRY"" and leave the stadium and make our way back to our hotel.  Again we asked employees where to go to catch a ride.  We were informed it is a 20mins walk to the end of the stadium in the ""ride share"" area.  We walked to this area then after talking to other spectators and finally being informed by an employee that we had to walk down the street and make a left turn as only taxis were allowed access to this location.  We started walking with other spectators to this location. After getting to this location and seeing that it was also blocked off by police/security.  Security officer told us we needed to walk farther just past an underpass then cross the street and wait by a school.  So now 1 hour after leaving the stadium and waiting and walking, we arrived at the school and saw at least 50 other people waiting for rides Lyft or Uber. Both companies increased their rates by up to 150%, very nice of them!!!  The first driver we called did not speak English very well, so after calling him several times and not being able to communicate with him, he decided not to show up because he could not find the pick up point.  This happened to several other people.  We had to call for another driver.  It is now dark out and this is not the best/safest area to be waiting.  A couple of guys came up to us and offered to drive us back to our hotel, we politely declined as they were not in a vehicle at the time.  A taxi driver offered to drive us for $100, over 3x times the cost of a Lyft or Uber.  Our driver finally showed up and we made it back to our hotel over 3 hours after the game had ended.  What should have been a fun experience was ruined by employees who need more training, the need for a ""marked"" and ""designated"" area for Lyft/Uber rides and ride share companies not raising prices by 150%.  Will not being going back to this stadium any time soon.  In hindsight, it might have been a better idea to drive to the game and pay the $33 parking fee, at least we would be in a vehicle and not waiting in a seedy neighborhood that is not well lite and hard to find for ride share drivers.  Would have taken pictures to submit, but I was on my phone..."
742,Date of experience: December 2018,3-Dec-18,ACC,Miami,5,Bills vs Dolphins,"Very well organized stadium, not the newest but very comfortable, Very nice people helping you find your way."
743,Date of experience: December 2018,2-Dec-18,ACC,Miami,5,Bills at Dolphins game,"We had a great time today even though sadly our Bills didn??t get the W, I want to share that the parking was easy, tailgating was fun and the fans all were nice regardless of which team. The stadium staff was friendly and helpful. As Bills fans we will definitely be going again next year! If you are sensitive to heat be aware that the sun blazes on the visitors side- the stadium provides lightweight sun shields which are definitely helpful. One of my friends on the other side snuck a pic of me melting and using it to cover my head (not its intended use ??). ??"
744,Date of experience: November 2018,29-Nov-18,ACC,Miami,5,Stadium is very nice and easy to get around in.,If you are going get a parking pass ahead of time and it is simple once you are in to find a spot. The stadium is very nice with plenty of bathrooms and food places. It's not cheap but it's comparable to other stadiums as well. The seats are all good just be ready for the sun! The club level is good and you can usually find someone willing to part with their upgraded tickets to allow you to get up there.
745,Date of experience: October 2018,15-Nov-18,ACC,Miami,4,Lions v. Dolphins,"Nice stadium.  We had access to the bars at ground level that we highly recommend.  One word of caution.  If you do not want to bake in the hot southern Florida sun, buy your seats on the Dolphins side of the field."

747,Date of experience: August 2018,28-Oct-18,ACC,Miami,5,Love,I love the renovations . It is really nice there now . Traffic sucks on 199th st when it??s a big event or game and Walmart doesn??t like for you to use the parking . But I love the new stadium
748,Date of experience: October 2018,25-Oct-18,ACC,Miami,5,Dolphins Game,"Can't fault the stadium!! Parking was really easy, we were worried because hadn't booked but police directed us politely to cash parking and was easy to find. Loads of tailgating which is cool. Loads of food and drink options inside the stadium but service is really slow at half time. We missed a touchdown whilst waiting for drinks in the 3rd Q. Great family atmosphere with loads of entertainment throughout the game. Only complaint is traffic leaving the stadium. Took about 45 minutes to leave and they'd shut the main route out to the highway so we ended up crawling through back streets. Would go again for sure."
750,Date of experience: October 2018,21-Oct-18,ACC,Miami,5,Game Day,Detroit v Dolphins weekend!Great place lots of action-especially from fans.Hubs is a die hard Dolphin fan.Everyone was great staff super nice.Our tickets were $745.00 and at half time we had many seat hoppers coming to our area.  It was pretty disruptive with the up down in out but all in all a fun day!
751,Date of experience: October 2018,21-Oct-18,ACC,Miami,3,Lions bs Dolphins,Stadium was great. Too a lift in and had to make a short walk. Problem and I do mean BS the directions to ride share are confusing and not correct. Police stop Uber and lift drivers for the benefit of cabs. Who takes a cab anymore really. Had to walk at least a mile to get access to a lift. What a away to wreck a good day we had at the game. Simply stated worst experience ever getting out of a stadium!
752,Date of experience: October 2018,21-Oct-18,ACC,Miami,5,"Love it, Fins Up!","My goodness, the Dolphins sure do know how to put on a football game.  Nothing compares, it's a total party and everyone is cool and laid back."
753,Date of experience: October 2018,20-Oct-18,ACC,Miami,5,Pre-buy parking,"The staff at Hard Rock Stadium is very very friendly and helpful. Even if there is no game, the Shop is open. If attending a Dolphins game, you should drive to the stadium a day before to buy a parking ticket, cause it's about half the price (25 $) than on gameday (40 $)."
754,Date of experience: October 2018,17-Oct-18,ACC,Miami,4,Pretty Good Stadium For Its Age.,"Arrived at the G cash parking lot at about $10:30 by taking the Turnpike down from Lauderdale. Parking is $40. but if you have a Sunpass the fee is only $25 charged to the Sunpass. Very easy getting in and tail gating was going strong in the very hot parking lot. Decided to head in 11:30 ish. There are  2 roads in between the parking lot and the stadium which caused minor delays getting to the other side of the road. Why there aren't pedestrian bridges are tunnels to ease the vehicle and people traffic is kinda stupid. Once at the NorthEast Gate things went smooth. The bag checks were smooth and fast. The actual ticket takers are turnstile machines with code readers.  All the levels have escalators to make the trip up easy. Once up on the 300 Level there was a spacious breezy deck due to the recent  rehab job.   Sitting in Section 218 was great and the whole stadium appeared to have great sight lines.  Overall  I thought the place was great. Now the minuses. There are not nearly enough monitors in the areas under the stands. The lines at the concessions and restrooms were pretty long. It also seems that a lot of the locals buy the cheapest tickets they can and then sit in better seats until the valid ticket holder show ups. This is very annoying and reminds me of a game of musical chairs. Finally, I'll mention  that they sell the souvenir cup for soda with unlimited refills, just like Tampa."
755,Date of experience: October 2018,16-Oct-18,ACC,Miami,5,Fantastic venue for home or away fans,"The Dolphins Hard Rock Stadium has a great atmosphere for any NFL fan. All the staff go out of their way to ensure all fans feel that they are special customers. We bought seats from Ticket Master.Com. midway along close to the halfway line but up near the top of the stand. We were surprised how good the view we had. Both sets of fans intermingled right around the stadium, without any issues and with great fan banter between them, even in the closely fought game. Sadly the Bears lost in overtime with 3 seconds to go. I??d recommend a trip to any NFL game at this amazing stadium."

759,Date of experience: September 2018,14-Oct-18,ACC,Miami,5,Very nice,This was a very nice and clean stadium.  Every thing was clean including the restrooms.

760,Date of experience: October 2018,8-Oct-18,ACC,Miami,5,Beautiful Stadium,We watched the University of Miami Hurricanes play Florida State Univeristy.  We sat in the 120 section.  Great seats.  Concessions and bathrooms were plentiful.  Only down side is there is not rapid transit.  Would recommend driving since the location for ride share pick up is over a mile away.
761,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Oct-18,ACC,Miami,2,this sucks for college games,"the way the stadium sets up for college is totally wrong they amplify the sound of music constantly and it takes away from the college experience for the fans , they forget we are not there to hear guns and roses or hip hop we want to hear the sounds of the bands the student the refs the mascot etc.. also the pricing for food and beverages is the same as the pro games, exp 5 dollars for bottle water is ridiculous 12 dollars or more for a beer is also sick not to mention the price of food"
762,Date of experience: September 2018,28-Sep-18,ACC,Miami,5,What an experience,I watched he Miami Dolphins play the Raiders (28-20 to the fins). The stadium is so good. Staff so helpful and friendly and loads of food and drink to choose from. Amazing venue.
764,Date of experience: September 2018,26-Sep-18,ACC,Miami,4,Great Stadium,"Caught a Dolphin game on their home turn for the first time and it was great. We had seats on the corner of the end zone with a great view of the field. Plenty of food options in the stadium, but I didn't see much outside due to the residential area. Parking looked like a mess, but we Ubered in and out without much hassle. I hope to get back there soon."
765,Date of experience: September 2018,22-Sep-18,ACC,Miami,5,"Loving the new ""Rock"" to enjoy the Canes' games","As season ticket holders see have seen the transformation of..Joe Robie, Pro Player, Land Shark...lost count. Hope it stays as the Hard Rock for years to come. They have  greatly improved the seats, concessions & club level seats. The staff it s very friendly with everyone and helpful to guide folks around."
766,Date of experience: November 2017,17-Sep-18,ACC,Miami,4,Bucs Vs. Fins. Bucs Win!,First time at the stadium since renovations. Great stadium with lots to do. We tailgated for the first time and it was a success. Got there early and got a great spot. Went to the game with my family and friends. Bucs Won! It is south florida and even in November it can get hot. Make sure to pack shade and stay hydrated.
767,Date of experience: September 2018,13-Sep-18,ACC,Miami,4,OTR II,"Jay and B rocked the house, comfortable seating. I was easy to locate my seat, a lot of walking. They just need to designate an area for Uber drop off and pick up"
771,Date of experience: September 2018,4-Sep-18,ACC,Miami,5,Very good place to go,Very good place to go to see a very nice showVery good parkingVery good organization of events .Different types of foods inside of stadium
773,Date of experience: September 2018,31-Aug-18,ACC,Miami,4,Dolphin pre season game,"I have visited all of the professional stadiums in Florida and this was the best. Parking was $25 with a sun pass and right across the street. Food was normal stadium prices, refillable cup was slightly smaller then Bucs or Jags.  Jacksonville has the best food. The addition of the roof is fantastic, night game in summer so was warm but not unbearable. Rained before the game but didn??t get wet because of the roof. Navigating around the stadium was a breeze. Everyone was polite and didn??t have any drunks around me which I always get in Tampa."
774,Date of experience: August 2018,29-Aug-18,ACC,Miami,5,NFL Dolphins Pre season game,The stadium is very nice.  The seats have a covering over them which helps with sun and rain.  The restrooms are clean.  The food stands have very nice workers.

776,Date of experience: August 2018,27-Aug-18,ACC,Miami,2,Lyft/Uber at Hard Rock Stadium,"I recently went to a Dolphin football game at Hard Rock Stadium?? The stadium is beautiful, the concession stand and bathrooms are great but do not take Lyft or Uber to the game and less you want to walk a mile to pick up your ride after the game?? It is at the elementary school and is totally disorganized and frustrating...It took an hour for them to pick us up because of the traffic"
784,Date of experience: August 2018,13-Aug-18,ACC,Miami,5,Great Upgrades from Old Joe Robbie,Went to a Dolphin Game and the New Stadium is WOW. The Hard Rock upgraded everything. The Food is a little out of hand in price but i had eaten before i went expecting that. The best thing was i was given the tickets so i didnt have to pay for a thing. Get there early so you could walk around and see all the new things.
787,Date of experience: August 2018,5-Aug-18,ACC,Miami,4,Great stadium,Fantastic stadium - took a while to get out with all the traffic but a great experience on the whole
789,Date of experience: August 2018,1-Aug-18,ACC,Miami,1,Organising a piss up in a brewery!,"We went to the stadium for the Manchester Utd V Real Madrid soccer match.Accessing the stadium was straightforward enough and let me say the stadium is pretty impressive and our seats had excellent views.We arrived 45 minutes beforehand so that we could get some food to eat. Having joined the queue with 5 people in front of us we left 40 minutes later not having been served as we didn??t want to miss the match starting. Shortly before half time I left my seat to try and food for the boys. Surprisingly extra concessions had opened up and only2 people in front of me. So tried for hot dogs, none available, cheeseburger delayed so ordered chicken tenders, only took 10 minutes!! Surely to goodness management can do a better job of organising food operations? The negativity being expressed by other attendees was clear for all to hear.When the match was over we then had the nightmare of trying to leave the car park. Absolutely minimal organisation and it took us over 90 minutes to exit the ground.Overall experience was so negative because of these factors that it ruined an otherwise exciting evening. I definitely won??t be back and management have a lot of questions to answer."
794,Date of experience: November 2017,26-Jul-18,ACC,Miami,4,Nothing like an NFL game !!,"Good stadium with good concessions. You have to go early for tailgate, it is unique to the US and is a lot of fun with nice people!"
806,Date of experience: December 2017,5-Apr-18,ACC,Miami,5,HIghly recommend attending a University of MIami Hurricanes game!,"This stadium is absolutely beautiful in the evening for night games.  Food is good, beer is expensive (like most pro stadiums).  Plentiful restrooms and parking.  Love the ""Richter"" scale on the four corner big screens."
812,Date of experience: December 2017,5-Mar-18,ACC,Miami,4,upgrades in place,I love the upgraded shaded area which covers most seats. Id say almost the whole 2 and third levels. It makes the place cooler with this SOFLO heat. Food and drinks are decent but not great.
813,Date of experience: December 2017,19-Feb-18,ACC,Miami,5,Great renovations,"This stadium has undergone many renovations making it well worth the experience of going to games and other events held here. In addition to a few dolphins games, I went to the Orange Bowl and had a great experience. Restrooms are kept clean, seats are comfortable and the club level is so luxurious. Super Bowl 2020 here I come!"
814,Date of experience: December 2017,5-Feb-18,ACC,Miami,5,Good stadium & even got to see the Dolphins beat the Patriots,It has been so long since I was here & I picked a good day.  The Dolphins beating the Patriots was great to watch.  We even got down to pitch side & met Don Shula.  The food & drink is on the expensive side but that is the same in most stadiums. All in all a good day
816,Date of experience: January 2018,28-Jan-18,ACC,Miami,5,Great rennovation / Good meeting spaces,"We attended a business event on the stadium, Spaces are clean and modern. It was a great experience to be able to walk on the field where all these great athletes play. We had a meeting at the exclusive club ""The Nine"" and it was everything we expected to be."
817,Date of experience: January 2018,17-Jan-18,ACC,Miami,5,Great Improvement,Went for the Orange Bowl game and was quite impressed with the new construction. Seats are more comfortable and most seats are covered from the elements. Definitely a great improvement over the past structure.
818,Date of experience: January 2018,15-Jan-18,ACC,Miami,4,"Excellent in-game experience, terrible parking exits","Sitting with access to the Hyundai Club was great, with many food/beverage options very near our seats. The view was great, and there were several large jumbotrons to accent. The overhangs and covering created a cool atmosphere, probably louder than it would??ve been otherwise."
819,Date of experience: December 2017,10-Jan-18,ACC,Miami,4,Home of the Miami Dolphins,Love the renovations that have been made to the stadium. Ample seating both club and multi level. Plenty of parking as well as Uber/Lyft pickup/drop off locations. Great concession selection. Bars and team store. Definitely a great place to watch your favorite college or professional team.
820,Date of experience: December 2017,10-Jan-18,ACC,Miami,5,Excellent stadium with many dining/drinking options,Sat in Section 120 on the Miami side for the Dolphins win over the Pats. Great game at a a top notch stadium. Craft beers galore on offer as well many fantastic eating options throughout the stadium.Tip - we picked up and inexpensive blue parking pass prior to the game and we basically park right in front of the stadium - easy in & out.
821,Date of experience: January 2018,6-Jan-18,ACC,Miami,5,Excellent club level,"This was my first time seeing an NFL game, and being a non football fan, I still had a great time. The atmosphere was great and the cleanliness and comfort was better then most other stadiums I??ve been to. The club level offered free soft drinks, pretzels and popcorn. The variety of restaurants (not free) included BBQ, burgers, Mexican etc. There was enough choice to keep our group happy. The seating was great. The new roof means no one will get wet if it rains. Loved the aqua marine seats. The giant screens were cool and there was was so much entertainment besides the game. Get there early to enjoy the facilities and avoid parking troubles."
822,Date of experience: December 2017,4-Jan-18,ACC,Miami,5,Awesome experience!,"My husband and I had 3rd row seats in the visitors section for the Miami-Bills game on New Year's eve.  We arrived very early without any parking pass, and were able to park in the yellow section for $40 using a credit card.  There are plenty of police and attendants all around the stadium, even off the highway exit ramp, ready to assist and very friendly.  You cannot carry anything larger than a clutch wallet into the venue; so if you have more, put it in a ziplock bag or purchase a see-through tote outside the venue.There is plenty to do besides tailgate outside the stadium - games, drinks, and music, plus plenty of picture taking opportunities.  The stadium itself has many food options and places to sit on every level.  We enjoyed Shula burgers and Haute Dogs.  The restrooms are spotless and huge.As Bills fans, the game was awesome!  We did not encounter much difficulty leaving the stadium as everything was clearly marked for departure."
823,Date of experience: December 2017,4-Jan-18,ACC,Miami,4,Dolphins Game Club Level,"The upgrades on this stadium are beautiful and we??re def needed from the previous- leave early for games if your not tailgating traffic backs up to enter. Plenty of onsite parking but runs $40 unless you use SunPass Discount only $20. Sat club level which gave us padded outdoor seating, indoors seating if needed, and plenty of food options. There??s also a LIV Club inside- very Miami! Found personnel to be nice and helpful even though we were fans of the opposing team!"
824,Date of experience: January 2018,1-Jan-18,ACC,Miami,5,Orange Bowl game,"A great stadium with comfortable seating. Very clean, good design with plenty of concession options. Enjoyed the Hyundai Club which featured full bar, carved meat sandwiches, tables and booths, souvenir shop. I think most seats had great views for football. We parked in the yellow parking lot and were on the freeway a few minutes after the game ended. Lots of room for tailgaters. Parking was $40.  Can only carry in very small purse."
825,Date of experience: December 2017,1-Jan-18,ACC,Miami,5,Wonderful Orange Bowl experience,We were pleasantly surprised to find out that our tickets to the Orange Bowl were located in a section that gave us access to the Hyundai Club. It was nice to have a place to go where you knew lines would be short and the bathrooms would be clean. We took advantage of this before the game and at halftime. All the employees we encountered were wonderful and very kind. We very much enjoyed the game and the stadium.
826,Date of experience: January 2018,1-Jan-18,ACC,Miami,3,Orange Bowl Game,"What a poor excuse for a stadium as a season ticket holder at Lambeau Field, we are very spoiled.  It was amazing how far the fans are from the field even with tickets in the 15th row at the 45 yard line.  The local police are absolutely clueless in getting traffic moving after the game and we saw several lines not even move one hour after the game.  Actually, we feel sorry for Dolphins and Hurricanes fans as they have no idea how poor this stadium compares to other venues."
827,Date of experience: January 2018,1-Jan-18,ACC,Miami,5,"Football, food and fun","I was given a free ticket to the Miami Dolphins and Buffalo game. Whoa, really awesome! I did a little homework and the newly named Hard Rock stadium has done some upgrades the last few years. First, parking. You need a parking pass or cash. Unless you have a Florida Sun pass. You can use your sun pass at the Yellow gate to park for only $25. Parking is 45 cash only. If you are going to Uber in then there is a special spot for pick up and drop off. Everything is clearly marked and people are happy to answer questions. I suggest getting there a couple of hours pregame to wander around the tailgaters and all the fun outside the stadium. Per NFL guidelines you can only carry in clear plastic bags. Women can carry a small wallet/wristlet. Luckily you can purchase such a bag outside the stadium. Once inside you walk up/ride the escalator to your level. You can find menus posted to columns. There are several places to get local food and craft beers.  Make sure you try the local food. Of course, it's pricey as expected. Bathrooms are frequent on each level and clean. There are a lot of employees & security wandering around. I found the seats in the stadium kinda small and tight in the rows. It's rather uncomfortable.  Depending on where you are, you could be in the sun with a horrible glare.  There are several large monitors for you to watch. If you get a chance to go see a game,I would!"
828,Date of experience: December 2017,1-Jan-18,ACC,Miami,5,Great stadium,"My wife and I went to the Orange Bowl. Our seats were in section 322 almost to the top row and we still had a clear and good view of the field. Mr. Ross and others did a great job with the renovation, there isn't a bad seat in the house."
829,Date of experience: December 2017,1-Jan-18,ACC,Miami,5,Last game of season,This is one of the best venues I have been to. Ample concessions no long lines and exceptionally clean.  Prices were very reasonable for an event. Plenty of security. Would definitely recommend and go again.
830,Date of experience: December 2017,31-Dec-17,ACC,Miami,5,Wonderful Orange Bowl experience,"The Orange Bowl has just been recently renovated and is beautiful. Many food and drink choices.they have 4 video screens hat make watching replays and other events during the game clear. The sound is amazing, not with an echo. The only negative was after the game trying to get an UBER. We waited 1 1/2 hours to get a car. Many Iver cars were there but you had to confirm with your driver have them find a spot with a number then let you know where that is. Such a mess. They need to improve this greatly. I would never take an UBER home from any event at the Orange Bowl. Other than that a fun experience."
831,Date of experience: December 2017,28-Dec-17,ACC,Miami,4,Very good Football Experience,Watched the Dolphins defeat the Broncos here. It is an excellent stadium with a huge score board. The shade over nearly the entire seating was great on a hot day.
832,Date of experience: December 2017,21-Dec-17,ACC,Miami,5,Gorgeous new stadium,"Visited the stadium for a monday night football game. The new stadium is beautiful. Traffic in and out is a nightmare, but the parking lot tailgating is a great experience."
833,Date of experience: December 2017,17-Dec-17,ACC,Miami,4,Remodeled stadium,"I was at Hard Rock Stadium years ago and it doesn't even look like the same place.  We splurged on Club seats and it was a great experience - live music, comfortable seats, fancy bathrooms, decent food and craft beer.  Compared to Boston, the prices seemed reasonable to me. I had to mark down one star though for that obnoxious ""First Down"" cheer that I heard way too often."
834,Date of experience: December 2017,17-Dec-17,ACC,Miami,5,Great Stadium,"First time here since the renovations. They did a very nice job and it??s looks great. Larger video screens, new roof overhang and glass everywhere on the outside really do make this place feel new.Food is good and reasonable for an NFL stadium. Friendly tailgating crowd but not as many as if you were in Gillette. Patriots lost which was an upset but overall enjoyed the stadium."
835,Date of experience: December 2017,15-Dec-17,ACC,Miami,5,Beautiful Stadium,Went here for the New England Patriots Game and alas we did not win but what a great place. Very clean and very well run. We ate at the stadium with a group buffet and the food was delicious. Took pictures with Dolphins fans and everyone was having a great time. Loved how organized the stadium was getting in and out. Nice job Miami !!
836,Date of experience: December 2017,12-Dec-17,ACC,Miami,5,New England Patriots Game,"Amazing stadium. Tons of room, lots of bathrooms, great food. The seats were good. Rarely waited in line for beer. Great experience!"
839,Date of experience: December 2017,6-Dec-17,ACC,Miami,5,Great way to watch football,"If you haven't been to the remodeled stadium, Check It Out! It's amazing and fits South Florida so well. Plenty of shade and protection from the rain in an outdoor stadium!  Food has been upgraded, a great place to tailgate and spend a day watching football."
840,Date of experience: December 2017,5-Dec-17,ACC,Miami,5,So beautiful,"Tho the results of the game wasn't to my liking, the improvements to the stadium are great. No more sweating profusely from the Florida sun. The roof design is a blessing allowing a nice breeze. The restrooms and concessions much nicer too."
841,Date of experience: December 2017,4-Dec-17,ACC,Miami,4,Great stadium,"Fairly easy to get in and out of.  I would suggest using Uber as they have set up a spot to get dropped off, tailgate, and then get out of dodge."
842,Date of experience: November 2017,19-Nov-17,ACC,Miami,5,Amazing new set up,Love the new improved stadium. Entrance and parking. Food vendors are getting better but not there yet
843,Date of experience: November 2017,14-Nov-17,ACC,Miami,1,Loudest stadium I have ever been in!,We were at the Notre Dame vs Miami hurricanes game.   The game was amazing for the hurricanes and not so great for the Irish.  But that wasn??t the biggest problem at the stadium.   The fans were very abusive and very threatening.  Dozen of ND fans left the stands in our area do to verbal abuse and actual physical abuse by the hands of the hurricane fans.  I can tell you that the police are very quick to stop the problem. Fans we saw 3 fans arrested from our section alone.   Hindsight we should have taken note of the warning signs posted on every light post outside tailgating.  Report any bad behavior and it gives you a number to text.
844,Date of experience: November 2017,14-Nov-17,ACC,Miami,5,Safest Stadium I've ever seen,Great Football stadium with the best food choices i have ever experienced.Security was everywhere for the biggest game of the season...and even in the parking lots watching for tailgator issuesPrices are cheaper than most and none of the concessions seemed like highway robbery by any means... Easy in and easy out... 1- Negative... they haven't figured out how to get big crowds who use Uber/ Lyft out very timely... traffic is still bad
845,Date of experience: November 2017,14-Nov-17,ACC,Miami,1,Bad policy prime for Abuse,"On Saturday, November 11, 2017, along with several colleagues I attended the University of Miami Hurricanes homecoming football game against Notre Dame at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fl.  We purchased four great seats from StubHub ?? section 126; row 2 ?? they were about $450 for each ticket.  We were mostly surrounded by UM fans except for four Notre Dame fans in the row behind us and a father and son sitting to my left.  As I have done for as long as I can remember, we cheered along with my colleagues with fervor and excitement as the Hurricanes pulled ahead in the 4th quarter by several touchdowns to a commanding lead and the game seemed all but won.  Seemingly, out of nowhere, I and one of my colleagues ?? the only 2 black men in the entire section ?? were approached by a contingent of 10-12 police officers and embarrassingly and forcefully escorted from the game and out of the stadium.  Of course, both my colleague and I were completely shocked that the police officers were coming to remove us from the game since we had done nothing wrong. Apparently, the Notre Dame fans sitting behind us falsely reported that I and my other black colleague were spitting at them, throwing things, and being otherwise disruptive.  Suffice it to say that nothing could be further from the truth.  In fact, other than the color of our skin we were completely indistinguishable from every other UM fan in the section.  Clearly, these particular Notre Dame fans?? frustration with the game bled over into some brooding, underlying bigotry and they decided to take that frustration out on the only 2 people of color around.  What is far worse is the police officers?? apparent presumption of guilt over innocence applied to my colleague and me due to our race.  While trying to explain to the officers that we had done nothing wrong, and even though multiple independent bystanders came to our defense and corroborated our innocence when the police approached, telling them unequivocally that we had done nothing wrong and were merely cheering like everyone else, we were nonetheless forcibly removed from the stadium in front of our friends and were indeed told that we were lucky that we were not being handcuffed or arrested.  This kind of police abuse and racial bias is in stark violation of this country??s fundamental precept that ??all men are created equal.??  My colleague and I suffered an injustice that nobody else, our white colleagues included, were forced to endure.  Whether it was the particular police officers?? inherent prejudice that catalyzed our forceful removal or some blanket corporate policy at Hard Rock stadium, the injustice is unacceptable all the same.Not only was this incident embarrassing in and of itself, but my colleague and I were walked out of the game by 10-12 uniformed police officers in front of tens of thousands of other fans.  What??s more, this happened in front of my work colleagues and could have a negative effect on my career.I am neither a thug nor a criminal, neither a convict nor a gangster.  I am a Fortune 1,000 executive and I am a black man; and this past Saturday while attending a college football game, I was the victim of racial intolerance and hate perpetrated by the very people tasked with preventing it.  The notion that the color of our skin subjected my colleague and me to embarrassment and possible arrest because of another team??s fans?? intolerance and profiling is indefensible.  That Hard Rock Stadium allowed it to happen is appalling, and the Miami-Dade Police Department??s handling of the situation is nauseating.This was, hands down and without equivocation, one of the worst experiences of my life.  It is made worse because it was the result of a completely falsified report that was unambiguously racially charged.  We were never really given the opportunity to share our side nor were the police willing to hear the other fans in the section.Thankfully, we left the stadium without further incident but the events of this past Saturday will live in my mind forever.  In hindsight I suppose I am lucky that I didn??t suffer any broken bones or other lasting physical reminders of the day but we need to do something to work towards a day when a man truly is judged not by the color of his skin but by the content of his character."
846,Date of experience: November 2017,12-Nov-17,ACC,Miami,2,Football game,"Beautiful facilities...but don't go to a game here if you are not a Hurricane or Dolphins fan. Little security...violent crowds...very unsafe atmosphere. I've attended games all over this country, this was the only place that I truly feared for my safety."
847,Date of experience: November 2017,12-Nov-17,ACC,Miami,4,Extremely loud,"I have attended many college and pro football games, but this stadium ranks among the loudest. The music was extremely loud leading up to the snap for the opposing team??s offensive play yet was quiet during the home team??s offensive series. I was impressed with ingress and egress that was quite simple and fast. Having escalators that go directly to each level is very efficient in getting to and from your seats. This reminded me of the old Giants stadium.We sat in the club level which had its own private bar and assigned covered outdoor seating and random indoor seating.Overall I was very impressed with this stadium with the exception of the extremely loud music. In my opinion it was just too loud to the point it was hard to hold a conversation with the person sitting next to you."
848,Date of experience: October 2017,9-Nov-17,ACC,Miami,4,"Improved service, fan experience and excellent eateries in the Club level","As an avid football fan, I've attended many games here and over the past year, the level of service has increased dramatically.  The attendants are nicer...even friendlier. The hiring and training shows it.  The seats (seem) more comfortable.  The food choices are much better than expected and the restrooms are impeccable.  Thanks to the folks at the Hard Rock for making the game experiences this year alot more memorable.  Keep up the good work!"
849,Date of experience: November 2017,8-Nov-17,ACC,Miami,4,"Great stadium, great crews!","From the front gate throughout the stadium and all the food & beverage staff- the personnel who represent are professional,  helpful & hospitable! We went for a Sunday night game- Dolphins vs Raiders- the stadium is really pretty at night. Tons of food & beverage choices. Would have given 5 stars but for these 2 cons: 1. We had seats at 116, paid $1500 for 4 tix- we would've expected there to be a tiny bit more room , but were all but in each others laps 2. Food & bev's are a bit on the pricey sideOtherwise, a very nice venue ?"
850,Date of experience: November 2017,6-Nov-17,ACC,Miami,5,"Great facilities, comfortable seating","Went to see a Dolphins game and was not disappointed with the facilities. Well organised parking lots and entry gates with plenty of attendants on hand if you needed extra guidance. Entertainment outside of the stadium in the run up to the game was available along with food and drink stations. Tailgate parties were in abundance and I have to say most folks did a great job of clearing up after as trash was at a minimum after the game. Plenty of security and police around helped to reassure the slight anxiety I have with large events like this. Inside the stadium everywhere was really clean, again plenty of attendants/security. Great selection of food and drink available, priced higher than usual as you would expect. Seating was comfortable and good view from section 353. Would recommend arriving early to allow for traffic and make sure if you need to take a purse it??s really small as there are security restrictions in place. Great experience at a well organised stadium with staff that really care."
851,Date of experience: November 2017,6-Nov-17,ACC,Miami,5,Awesome time,Awesome game and it was a great experience.  The uber lot is forever away and hard to find.  Luckily we left with sufficient time and didn't have a long delay.  Food and drinks are pricey but it was still a good time.
852,Date of experience: November 2017,5-Nov-17,ACC,Miami,1,Uber Zone is a FAIL,"The Uber Drop Zone at stadium is FAIL.  This great idea is just an executional mess.  Consider last night after Miami/VT game:- 5 drops from drivers- Almost 90 minute way for rodeAnd the picture from Uber Mosh Pit says it all.Pro Tips:- Go to 199th Street Directly for pick Up, or - Go to South Side of stadium- Do NOT go to the pit until the figure this out"
853,Date of experience: November 2017,5-Nov-17,ACC,Miami,4,Great place to experience a football game,In town on business and happen to be weekend Virginia Tech and Miami were playing. Great venue to watch football. Good food choices and beer selections. A lot of security and helpful staff. Make sure you read restrictions on what's allowed into stadium. My wife had what I call a small purse. IT was NOT allowed into stadium. We had to place the contents into a plastic bag then check her purse into a guest services station before going to game. We retrieved it afterwards and all was good. We both appreciate the security measures in this day and time but make sure you know the rules when you attend an event.
854,Date of experience: October 2017,31-Oct-17,ACC,Miami,5,"Miami Hurricanes Game, Awesome Experience!","I recently went to my first Miami Hurricanes football game two weeks ago when we played Georgia Tech. Parking was fairly quick getting into the game and only cost 20 dollars which wasn't to bad. Getting into the stadium was smooth and quick. We sat on the Northeast side of the end zone and it was a 3;30 game so we got a fairly decent amount of sun. At halftime the sun went below the stadium and we started to experience rain. Where we sat, we were under a canopy and did not get wet at all. The crowd was awesome as the game was close. I had a blast! Tickets were fairly cheap to sit low, I advice going and checking out a game at this venue."
855,Date of experience: October 2017,23-Oct-17,ACC,Miami,5,Great Stadium with friendly staff,"I went to a Miami Hurricanes game.  This was the first time I have been to the Stadium since Hard Rock bought it.  Great improvement.  Well marked, easy to get around, comfortable seating, well staffed with friendly people.  I couldn't find my car upon leaving and a gentleman drove me around in a golf cart until we found it.  Class Act."
856,Date of experience: October 2017,19-Oct-17,ACC,Miami,3,"Don't let the ""roof"" fool you","The new additions and cool design are a big improvement over the older stadium. However the partial roof does hold back the heat or sun. Sun comes from an angle so it's on the one side most of a game. If it rains, and when doesn't it, you will get wet. The wind blows the rain to most seats and the more expensive seats close to the field aren't covered by any roof. The scoreboards for football just plane s___! They flash everything on the scoreboard and you can't keep track of down and distance and time left because they are busy flashing player stats all game. Very frustrating gotta fix that!  Staff is really nice, a big plus."
857,Date of experience: October 2017,17-Oct-17,ACC,Miami,5,Not the Orange Bowl...but close enough,Not quite the Orange Bowl but close enough. After all the renovations this stadium went from lifeless to one of the best in the nation. There are plenty of delivious food options and various bars that serve specialty beers. The jumbotrons on each corner ensure you wont miss a beat. You will have a great view from any seat and the roof covers majority off the seats from the rain. During daytime games avoid the away side as the sun is unblocked on that side of the stadium.
858,Date of experience: October 2017,16-Oct-17,ACC,Miami,4,Ga. Tech vs. Miami Hurricanes,"Make sure your shuttle driver drops you off near your seating area.  We were dropped off at the NW gate and our entrance was on the South side (home side for the Hurricanes).  its a hefty walk when you are trying to see the Canes Walk which is at the SW Gate. Stadium personnel on the outside are inept with directions.  You have to do your homework.  The Club level tickets are pricey but worth it. Cushioned seats, shade, AC lounge with great drinks and food.  Really nice.  Although it poured during a 4th quarter thunderstorm we didn't get wet.  Great game.  Go Canes!"
859,Date of experience: October 2017,9-Oct-17,ACC,Miami,5,Club level awesome,This was the first time we have been available to use our season tickets. The stadium is fantastic. The remodel beautiful. And the Dolphins WON! You can??t ask for a better day.
860,Date of experience: September 2017,24-Sep-17,ACC,Miami,4,Beautiful stadium and helpful and courteous staff,I was a visitor for the opposing team. The stadium is beautiful. The staff was very helpful and courteous. The sun on the visitor's side was brutal.  So if you have a choice sit on the home side. The parking was fine. We parked in lot 18 which was just across the street and an easy access to the turnpike and I-95.  It was also easy to tailgate and had a mix of home and visiting teams.
866,Date of experience: August 2017,24-Aug-17,ACC,Miami,5,great opportunity to watch a game,"a really great experience. Even for pre season you need to get there early ( we missed the start) and parking is an outrageous $40!! You can't get anything larger than a very small handbag into the stadium.Once inside the views are great, the TVs fantastic and the overall experience was excellent. Even the game felt a little quicker than when watching on TV.Prices fro food/drink are the usual shocking amounts but those multi million $ contracts don't pay themselves!!Would go again tomorrow - great event.Pre season tickets cheap - we paid $11 on Stubhub. Sound in the stadium is fantastic - it must be bouncing when its a real game."
867,Date of experience: August 2017,17-Aug-17,ACC,Miami,4,Pre season,"Great time at  the game. The new stadium is excellent, plenty of food choice. Although security is tight and baby bag are no allowed, great seat of the dolphins players. We definitely come back."
868,Date of experience: August 2017,12-Aug-17,ACC,Miami,4,Dolphins Preseason Game,My wife and I really enjoyed our trip to see the Dolphins play in their first preseason game for 2017. We found the stadium easily accessible with more than adequate parking. Everything was well lit and there was plenty of security before and after the game. Free wifi is available inside along with a ton of choices for food and drinks. The open roof provided for a wonderful evening in South Florida. Ushers were plentiful and helpful during the evening. Free refills on soft drinks with a souvenir cup was nice.
869,Date of experience: August 2017,11-Aug-17,ACC,Miami,1,Worst live football experience in 60 years!,"Went to Dolphins game for the first time with friends.  While the company was good, the stadium experience is a mess.  The traffic is so fouled up going into the stadium by Police who stand around and block lanes, that we didn't get to our seats until the end of the first quarter.  Thousands of others came streaming in afterwards, because they were also delayed.  The new scoreboards have much smaller print, and are very hard to read.  The public address system was completely unintelligible, keeping us in the dark about what was happening.  The jumbo-trons spent 90% of their time oogling the cheerleaders and fans acting stupid, rather than focusing on the field action.  The legroom in the seating rows are much tighter than Marlins Park - uncomfortable.  Signage is sparse and hard to find parking entrances and gates once inside the stadium.  $50 million of renovation wasted for a bad experience.  Suggest traffic control go to Indiana and see how traffic is moved to and from Notre Dame games and Indy 500.  We will not return -- ever!"
946,Date of experience: October 2022,29-Mar-23,ACC,North Carolina,4,ACC needs better tailgating,"I'm a big football fan and living in South Carolina there's lots of that. Duke, NC State, North Carolina,  South Carolina,  Wake Forest,  Coastal Carolina,  Clemson and more.  I enjoy going to different stadiums to experience college football from different views.  Chapel Hill was a great Experience.  Wasn't a lot of areas for tailgating but they did have lots of areas for tent parties.  Parking was a few blocks away in one of several parking garages and wasn't expensive. Inside the stadium was about the same.  Concessions and snacks all around.  The fans were loud and the game was awesome.  I'm use to South Carolina and William Brice Stadium where we have lots of tailgating before,  During and After the game.  This Stadium was smaller and had little reserved tailgating."
947,Date of experience: October 2022,29-Oct-22,ACC,North Carolina,2,Mediocre,"Let me say that this is a TINY stadium.  If you are over 6 feet tall you will be in serious pain before the game is over as the rows of fold down seats are so close together you literally can??t sit straight without kneeing the person in front of you. Bench seats are almost better at least you aren??t pressed up against the back Kroger another seat.  The sight lines are good for the most part except on the end zone opposite the student section with the brick wall. The stadium is right in the heart of campus and chapel hill which is great for the students and general access.  The stadium concourses on the other hand are a total nightmare and make no sense.  You are constantly weeving in and out of the stadium shell as you walk from gate to gate and you are dodging over head concrete stairs, walls, etc.  To be honest the stadium needs to be torn down completely and rebuilt.  The bathrooms are like porta potties."
948,Date of experience: September 2019,1-Oct-19,ACC,North Carolina,5,"Kenan Memorial Stadium......You can't see it, but its there.","Always a great visit to Kenan.  Holds approximately 60,000 and you can't see it from ground level as it is built in a valley.  2 major hints....1.  Always try to get tickets on the West side of the stadium if a day game.  You will watch it in the shade.  East side gets hammered with the setting sun.  2...Always buy the bottle of water outside the stadium because when you get it the stadium you can refill your bottle free with the big blue cooler.  Just ask...its there."
949,Date of experience: September 2019,30-Sep-19,ACC,North Carolina,3,"Average, UNC is behind the facilities curve","Attended the UNC v. Clemson game as a Tiger fan this week.  This wasn't my first time but it's been a while and it felt like little has changed which in the world of sports generally is not a good thing.  The display boards on both ends in particular need updating badly.  From our seats (about the goal line on the visitors side), the boards were not clear.  I hadn't read about the installation of field turf and while I understand the economics and the need in colder climates, I think turf fields overall take away stadium aesthetics.  Kenan is used for other sports as well including some high school events so that adds to the practical side of it.  I'm not critical of the decision but from an optics standpoint, I don't like it.The one thing I do like and have always liked is how Kenan is nestled on campus in the trees and you really don't have much of a sense there's a stadium at all until you enter.  It would cost some money but if the facade and facilities could be improved some, it has great potential to be a premiere venue even if it is a little small.  What appeared to be ""club"" spaces at the top level of all 4 sides also looked very nice and well done.There are seatbacks too.  They aren't the most comfortable but they are a lot better than bleacher seats and carrying your own seatbacks like we have to do at Clemson.I still recommend though.  It's a fun place to see a game and it's an older stadium which adds to the experience."
951,Date of experience: November 2018,2-Dec-18,ACC,North Carolina,3,Easily in the lower half of ACC Stadiums,"UNC-CH recently reduced the number of seats from a little over 60,000 to approx. 51,000. The new individual seats are far better than the old ones but attendance by the home team fans is still absurdly low. Based on the new seating capacity there couldn't have been more than 20,000 fans. We were there for the last game of the year and NC State fans easily out numbered UNC-CH fans. In the last few minutes of the game most of the UNC-CH fans had already left while they actually had a chance of winning the game before they lost in overtime. It was a cold and rainy game. Restrooms are terrible. Crowded and filthy dirty. Concession stands don't have much of a variety and what they have isn't very good and is definitely overpriced. Parking close enough to the stadium to walk to the game is horrible. For visitors the best option is to park at the Friday Center on Hy 54 and ride a shuttle bus for $5 to the game. It's still a long walk to the stadium from where you are dropped off."
952,Date of experience: October 2018,15-Oct-18,ACC,North Carolina,4,Good night of football,The stadium is a little old but the seats were comfortable. I thought the food was somewhat uninspiring but the students seemed to love their Bojangle boxes...We took advantage of the park and ride. For $5.00 round trip (each) we were transported to the stadium and back. We used the 103 Airport Dr. lot which was pretty close to I40.
953,Date of experience: September 2018,23-Sep-18,ACC,North Carolina,4,Fun Experience,"Kenan is an older stadium that has recent updates. While it holds 66,000 it doesn't appear that large when compared to Carter Finely in Raleigh which holds 54,000 thousand.  You will be surrounded by a sea of Tar Heel Blue as it should be. The crowd is engaged and not drunk and obnoxious as there is no drinking. The ushers and staff are incredibly kind and attentive. One man offered to help me carry my drinks and food to my seat, I overheard another offer to get a cane for an older patron who appeared to be struggling some with the stairs. We were fortunate enough to have seats in one the recently renovated areas -- they were incredibly comfortable -- cushioned on the back and seat. Food is available -- and while a little pricey not terrible. It was an extremely hot day -- all the ushers reminded folks to hang on to their bottles and cups so they could refill at the ""hydrating stations"" set up. Get to the area early as parking is a challenge and traffic builds up. A really nice experience -- Go Tar Heels!"
958,Date of experience: November 2017,25-Nov-17,ACC,North Carolina,4,Good family venue for college football,"In full disclosure, I have been a volunteer usher here for many, many years. Overall, the venue is picturesque and the staff work hard to maintain a family atmosphere. I understand at other college football stadiums around the country, the percentage of drunk and obnoxious fans can be quite high. In recent years the stadium has not always been packed and I do wish the fans would be more engaged at times, but this is a good place to take visitors or families to see a football game. We've invited friends here and they always seem to enjoy it -- win or lose. The marching band is fun and there's usually a lot going on on the video boards and PA system."
959,Date of experience: November 2017,18-Nov-17,ACC,North Carolina,3,Relic on lovely campus,"Attended as a visitor.  This stadium has some dead viewing spots and the seats are not comfortable.  It reminds me of some high school stadiums. Bathrooms are old and outdated.   Most ACC schools have spent money updating their stadiums, but I guess all the money at UNC has gone to basketball...."
961,Date of experience: October 2017,30-Oct-17,ACC,North Carolina,4,Great game day,"This is a great place to watch a game even if  you are not UNC fan and from the visiting team. Good seating all around but caution if you are down in the first 8 rows behind the benches. Good selection of food for purchase as no food can be brought into the stadium. Helpful staff on hand to guide you to the seats with backs - always a plus . Home team on the 100 seat side . Parking can be a challenge if not pre paid locations .Some outer parking has shuttles buses , so do some research. Friendly fans maybe the most I have ever encountered at any university stadium."
962,Date of experience: October 2017,29-Oct-17,ACC,North Carolina,1,"Visibility, ZERO...   :(","Kenan Memorial Stadium is a nice stadium however the one rating has to do with undisclosed dead spots.  Purchased tickets to the Miami Hurricanes vs Carolina Tar Heels game held at Kenan Memorial Stadium online via Vivid Seats.  I sat in row A....     Game visibility was zero.  Even standing I could not see the game.  My view was obstructed by the medical tent, home players and Camera men.  Avoid row A if your intent is to WATCH the game live.  I had to watch on the jumbo screen..  Folks I could have watched TV at home.  I called Vivid Seats to complain only to be told by Dago, the Customer Care Supervisor that I should have known better and that all football stadiums have dead spots in row A.  Really Dago?  Yes, I'll get over it while taking my future business elsewhere."

965,Date of experience: October 2017,15-Oct-17,ACC,North Carolina,3,UVA GAME,"Nice stadium experience as the seats are aluminum with backs which is a plus over most stadiums who have just the benches unless you pay a premium price. Wish the boards at both ends of the field showed stats, score, downs and time like most instead of all this info being on video boards around stadium. Huge waste to just utilize boards for video of game and replays. The concourse area where concessions are is a menagerie. Up, down and around describes making your way around. This area needs to be updated to match the inside of the stadium. Make sure whether your a UNC fan or a visitor get your tickets on UNC side if the game is not a night game as the afternoon sun is directly in your eyes and on warm days it's miserable."
966,Date of experience: September 2017,8-Sep-17,ACC,North Carolina,3,A Funkadelic Relic,"I attended the University of California vs, North Carolina football game at Kenan Stadium.  This place needs to be replaced.  The rows of seats are so close together that my 6??5?? frame couldn??t fit on my row.  That is actually my only complaint of the stadium, but if you cannot fit into your seat, that??s huge in my opinion.  The food was sustenance, chicken sandwiches with no fixings, the drinks served in Souvenir cups.  It was hotter than we southern Californians were accustomed to.  We were happy to get out of there with a victory!  If you are 6ft or shorter, I would recommend you see a football game at the relic of a stadium!"
967,Date of experience: September 2017,5-Sep-17,ACC,North Carolina,2,Dreadful Stadium on a Lovely Campus,"I suppose if you're in the Blue Zone, or in the Art Pope seats at the top of the stadium, Kenan might offer you a comfortable experience (though the BZ is in the end zone). But if you're doomed to the aluminum bench seats in the lower and upper seating bowls, prepare for serious discomfort (by all means, rent a seatback for $8, but there's no way to acquire additional legroom; unless you are small, you will feel very cramped). Clearly, UNC has put a few bucks into the stadium in recent years, but every single upgrade was reserved for the well-heeled paying $100 and up per ticket; students and regular fans were ignored. The capper on Saturday (9/2/17) was sitting in the lower deck beneath the overhang (Row TT), and having a steady drip from the upper deck directly onto my seat throughout a game during which no rain fell. I was aware that parking was challenging, and prepared accordingly, but had no warning about the poor seating. Sorry, but for this fan Kenan Stadium pretty much sucks."
968,Date of experience: October 2016,18-Aug-17,ACC,North Carolina,5,Bigger and Better,"Recent upgrades to the stadium and the addition of the Blue End in the last decade have made Kenan an even better place to watch a game than it was when I was growing up. Night games are excellent, especially in the autumn months when the air is crisp."
969,Date of experience: November 2016,3-Jul-17,ACC,North Carolina,3,One of the worst stadiums in the ACC,"It's old. There have been additions and renovations but basically they benefited the high dollar donors. For visiting fans it is terrible. If you are 5 ft tall and weigh 100 lbs you can fit the bench seats. Otherwise be prepared to be crowded and have no leg room. The benches are too close together. The location is good for students who live on campus since it is located right in the middle of campus but for most of their fans and for visitors you have to park at least 5 miles away and ride a shuttle bus that still drops you off at least 1/2 mile from the stadium. Bathrooms are small and outdated resulting in long lines. There is not a very good selection of food and drinks for sale and the concession stands are not very well placed. try not to get seats in the 1s few rows. If you do forget about seeing the game. Those seats are not high enough to see over the bushes and people on the sidelines. If UNC-CH is losing in the 3rd quarter most of the fans leave. Often there are more visiting team fans left at the end of the game than home team fans. While the stadium holds around 60,000, for most games there will be on the order of 40-45,000 fans. They also turn the scoreboard off as soon as the game is over when they lose."
970,Date of experience: September 2016,7-Mar-17,ACC,North Carolina,4,Kenan,"Thsi stadium is in the middle of campus, which helps it in some ways (proximity to other places to visit, scenery, etc) but hurts it in others (tailgating for ex). Many improvements have been made over the years. Be careful in choosing sides to sit on. The sun can be a big factor. Also, be prepared for aluminum bench seating and long restroom lines."
971,Date of experience: October 2016,1-Mar-17,ACC,North Carolina,3,"For a college stadium, not bad",The stadium has some age although there have been some recent renovations for the bigger contributors. Seats are primarily aluminum bleachers and you want to be careful not to get seats too low as you will not be able to see the field over the players. Parking near the stadium is almost non-existent so tailgating is a challenge.
972,Date of experience: September 2016,16-Jan-17,ACC,North Carolina,2,Not worthy of a Div 1 school,"Kenan Stadium is not a great place to watch a game. While I recognize the stadium is on a college campus, any tailgating is almost non-existent . As for the stadium itself, The Kenan Center in the West End zone is a complete waste of space. The stadium has strange architecture in the concourse, so trying to dodge the concrete obstacles while navigating through the narrow concourse is more difficult than running through the defensive line. When you finally get to your seats, you have the luxury of sitting in the hot sun on metal bleachers. One tip, make sure you know where the shade starts for games in Sept/Oct."

Kenan isn't the biggest or the most high tech, but none of them match the setting, seating, and feeling you get when you're in the Tar Heels house. There isn't a bad seat, the surrounding campus says ""university"" like no other, and even the concessions are great. I do miss the ""wall"" in the men's rest rooms though. Basically, when you've seen a game here, whichever team wins, you've been part of what college football is all about; you've experienced a classic."
989,Date of experience: November 2015,10-Nov-15,ACC,North Carolina,5,One of the best football stadiums in America!,"The stadium has been renovated nicely over the years and is a great college venue to watch football. Even though I went in a torrential deluge, the place was packed and the food hit the spot. Its a true college stadium where seats are a little compacted, but this means fans are packed in much closer to the action and not overly spread. I highly recommend watching a game here, especially one wher the Tar Heels crush rival Duke, as they did."

It was very hot the day we were there and were glad to see that there were water fountains and jugs of water available for one to re-fill their water bottle instead of having to buy a new bottle each time.  We didn't see them, but others told us that the stadium also had iced towels that they were giving out to people to help with the heat. the hedges of plants separating the seats and the field add a nice touch."
993,Date of experience: September 2014,6-Aug-15,ACC,North Carolina,3,Nice stadium,Kenan Memorial Stadium is where the UNC Tarheels play their home football games. The stadium isnt huge like some SEC or Big 10 stadiums but not a bad seat to be had.

Seats can be tight if large people are seated next to you, but isn't that at any stadium??  If you bring bags they will be checked by secruity before you enter. Many areas to park and ride to the stadium. Just go to Tarheel Express website to find locations to park and catch the bus! $5.00 a head for round trip. Well worth the $5.00 to me This does require a little hike up and down some hills once you are dropped off, so ladies wear comfy shoes. Food/ drinks are always over priced, but again isn't that at any stadium??  Lots of places to go before a game if you want to arrive early. Local restaurants coffee shops etc. Cute little town to go before the game if times allows about 15minutes away. Downtown Hillsbourgh. A historic town with really cool places to eat and lots of them have outdoor seating! If in the area that would be worth the drive. GO HEELS!!!"

1001,Date of experience: September 2013,10-Jul-14,ACC,North Carolina,1,What a dump.,"Worst footballl stadium i have ever been in. The seats were made for midgets, the sight lines are horrible, and if you sit in the first 15 rows, you cant see anything going on on the field!"
1002,Date of experience: September 2013,15-Jun-14,ACC,North Carolina,5,beautiful stadium,the stadium surroundings are in the middle of the unc grounds.  the university is well known about the small town university.  the students enjoy the restaurants and bars being in walking distance to their dormitories.  athletics and arts are a integral part of the university system.  the stadium continues to be remodeled to increase the size and promote more deluxe boxes.
1005,Date of experience: September 2013,24-Apr-14,ACC,North Carolina,5,The Gameday Experience for the Family,I enjoy taking my whole family to enjoy the UNC football gameday experience. The stadium has been redone to really promote a state of excellence in the air. The new big screen is just awesome. Highly recommend bringing the whole family.
1007,Date of experience: November 2013,2-Dec-13,ACC,North Carolina,3,Needs More Leg Room,This stadium was built for little people seats are too close and at 6' my knees were in the back of the person in front of me. Forget trying to get out if your in the middle of a row. The food was ok the service staff polite and the field and jumbotrons nice to view when people stand up.
1008,Date of experience: October 2013,5-Nov-13,ACC,North Carolina,5,We love UNC so we are biased.,"What a gorgeous stadium!   Of course, we are Tar Heel fans so we would think so.  There are plenty of bathrooms and lots of food and product outlets, too.   The only issue is parking.  But that's an issue no matter what you are doing in Chapel Hill.  It's a small college town with a huge amount of students.   Hence, tough parking.  Kenan is beautiful."
1012,Date of experience: November 2012,23-Jan-13,ACC,North Carolina,3,"Lots of fun, avoid parking",This is a great stadium with awesome facilities and signage.  A word of warning: the atrocious parking at UNC is not a myth.  Spend $5 for round-trip transport from the University Mall to save a headache.
1015,Date of experience: November 2012,2-Dec-12,ACC,North Carolina,4,Not taller than the trees,Hidden in the tall trees by design. Fits so nicely in the campus   A real treat even when the Tarheels don't manage to win.
1016,Date of experience: November 2012,19-Nov-12,ACC,North Carolina,5,Great place to see a game,"I love how this stadium is surrounded by trees. It's beautiful. The food is pretty good, and the stadium is clean. Student seating isn't very comfortable, but the price is right (it's free)!"
1017,Date of experience: November 2012,12-Nov-12,ACC,North Carolina,4,Not a bad seat to be found,"Given the fact that the University of North Carolina is known more for basketball than football, I didn't come in expecting too much of the stadium.  However it is larger than expected, and having sat at different areas throughout the stadium there really is not a bad seat to be found.  Like most stadiums the concessions were overpriced and bland.  I would've liked to see some more variety highlighting local specialties as you find at other stadiums.There are bathrooms throughout the stadium and plenty of concession stands available.  It would've been nice to see more fan support, as there were a lot of empty seats at all of the games except against NC State.  For the most part, the fans were well behaved so it is a good atmosphere to bring your kids to a game.  Make sure to bring a raincoat (umbrellas are not allowed inside) or warm clothing when the weather gets bad.  There is some seats with overhead cover, but most of the stadium is open to the elements.As with most college marching bands today, the halftime show will put you to sleep.  I would recommend using this time to get something to eat or just walk around the grounds.  If you are looking at going to a UNC Football game, Kenan Stadium is a good stadium to watch the game from.  It is also conveniently located to the shuttle bus stops.  I would recommend parking at the University Mall and taking the shuttle to the game.  It only costs $5 per person and you beat the traffic and get to/from the stadium quickly.  The University Mall location is also the shortest line of the various shuttle bus locations."
1020,Date of experience: September 2022,13-Sep-22,ACC,NC State,5,NC State Game,"I am not an NC State fan, but I figured since I lived in the area I should check out a game. All I can say is WOW. Great experience, atmosphere, and venue!"
1021,Date of experience: September 2022,13-Sep-22,ACC,NC State,4,Great place for football!! Go Pack!!,Been here several times throughout the years! Stadium is several miles away from downtown Raleigh and the NCSU campus so there is plenty of space for parking and the shuttles are provided to the Westchase lots. The stadium is always full of energy on game day with plenty of food options. Beer is now served in the stadium which is nice. There are metal detectors when you enter and I did see plenty of security and Raleigh police officers on site during games
1023,Date of experience: November 2019,23-Dec-19,ACC,NC State,5,Wolfpack football,"This was my first game in years. The stadium is very nice! I sat with the students in the end zone that used to be a grassy hill when I went to school there. Great view of the field from there and just about anywhere. Nice large screens with replays and other info. The bathroom lines moved quickly. Parking without a pass meant parking at a business down the road and still paying $20, but getting out wasn't too bad. Be warned that many people stand up for most of the game, so you might have to stand up on your seat to see over others."
1024,Date of experience: September 2019,13-Nov-19,ACC,NC State,5,great spot to watch a game,"very nice stadium.  good site-lines, everyone is close to the field.   plenty of amenities, restrooms, concession stands, etc.   parking is easily accessible."
1025,Date of experience: September 2019,9-Oct-19,ACC,NC State,5,NC State Football,Great place to watch college football. Plenty of options for concessions and prices are about the average for stadium food.
1026,Date of experience: August 2019,4-Sep-19,ACC,NC State,5,Great Stadium with Awesome Tailgating,"Carter Finley seats 60,000 plus.  All the seats on the sidelines are good  and the end zones are as good as any end zone seats.  Excellent concessions.  Prices not bad for sporting event.  You can leave the stadium at half time and come back in for the second half.  Wolfpack Fans are very passionate and supportive.  Bathrooms ... well it is a sporting event."
1027,Date of experience: November 2018,6-Nov-18,ACC,NC State,5,Attended NC State homecoming.  Stadium is easy to navigate.  The game was great because NC State beat Florida State.,"If you are a Wolfpack fan you will love Carter Finley Stadium.  And if you are a visitor, the Wolfpack fans will treat you kindly."
1028,Date of experience: November 2018,5-Nov-18,ACC,NC State,5,Gorgeous facility,"While the old Carter-Findley Stadium was cozy and unique, this stadium is first class all the way! Just gorgeous."
1029,Date of experience: October 2018,21-Oct-18,ACC,NC State,3,Go Pack,"Nice collegiate stadium.   Limited food, but good.  Get the pulled pork sandwich!  Clean and adequate restrooms.  Parking is terrible.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  Clear bags only. Bring your own stadium chair or rent one.  Binoculars recommended.  Go Pack!"
1030,Date of experience: September 2018,3-Oct-18,ACC,NC State,5,Best Stadium in North Carolina for Football,"Hot, sunny early fall day in Carter Finley for a NC State Football Game is easily the best place to be for football fans. Not a bad seat anywhere in the Stadium. Tailgating before & after the game is outstanding with over 10,000 numbered parking spots for Wolfpack fans around the stadium and the next door PNC Arena for NC State Basketball. Visitors who arrive at the last minute can still find a parking place within a few minutes walk. Concession stands are everywhere and have good prices."
1031,Date of experience: September 2018,9-Sep-18,ACC,NC State,5,HEAVEN ON EARTH 4 WOLFPACK FANS,Carter finely is an amazing stadium. The seating is laid out and there isn't a bar seat in the house.  The fans are the best.  I took my 10 yr olds daughter to get 1st WOLFPACK game AnD she loved it. Parking can be found about a 10 min walk away for free but there is plenty of closet parking if you want to pay $20. Great place to bring the family.
1032,Date of experience: November 2017,20-Aug-18,ACC,NC State,5,Great Venue for Exciting College Football Action,"Great North Carolina State University football action in a stadium with a good game atmosphere.  Concession items are standard game fare, prices are reasonable."
1033,Date of experience: November 2017,21-Jul-18,ACC,NC State,5,Fantastic Football Spot,This is a great place to go tailgating and watch a football game with the fireworks and the crowd noise this is a fantastic arena or stadium this is also a wonderful place to go see an outdoor concert when they have that I've seen you to in Rolling Stones
1035,Date of experience: August 2017,4-Feb-18,ACC,NC State,5,Football game with the family,My son goes to college here and we came down to watch Syracuse versus NC State. The stadium was very nice and it was easy to get into and out of.
1036,Date of experience: August 2017,12-Dec-17,ACC,NC State,4,It's the ACC,I'm personally a SEC fan so I'm all about football. The stadium was nice. When I went the Wolfpack won their game. Traditions are alive and well.
1038,Date of experience: September 2017,28-Nov-17,ACC,NC State,4,First Visit To Stadium,"Visited this stadium on Saturday Sept. 30,17 to see the Wolfpack  take on the Orangemen of Syracuse. Sat in the opponent  player comp section of the stadium in row U. Seat numbers seem not to matter as I saw so many people move about in the same row. Good sight lines parallel to the goal line. The higher level seats in this area offer some protection from the sun. Closer to the end zone scoreboard as well. Don't expect to see replays of touchdowns or great plays by the opposing team on the score boaard. Parking seems to be an issue around almost any large size stadium. I was able to drop off my passengers and attempt to park close. Overall a good experience."
1039,Date of experience: November 2017,25-Nov-17,ACC,NC State,4,Really good stadium really good atmosphere,After living in the area for 15 years. This was the first time in attendance for a NC State football game. It was a cool experience. State fans are loyal. It was a rivalry game against UNC. We were in the last row. The seats didn??t feel like the nose bleed section. The site lines were very good. The players didn??t look like ants. The stadium production kept the game fun. There were very few lulls in the action. Getting in and out of the stadium was easier than I thought. BTW state won. Yeah I??d see a game there again.
1040,Date of experience: November 2017,10-Nov-17,ACC,NC State,5,Great affordable food options!,"Love how hot chocolate is offered when the weather turns cold. Has great affordable food options: Papa Johns Personal Pizza $5, Pork Sandwich was $4 or $5."
1041,Date of experience: October 2017,7-Nov-17,ACC,NC State,4,Brilliant American football stadium to visit,My son and I visited this stadium while in Raleigh . It's the home of North Carolina and is a great facility. We were fortunate to be offered access by a staff member on a non match day -but this is not guaranteed. If you are interested in American football = this is worth a visit
1042,Date of experience: October 2017,17-Oct-17,ACC,NC State,5,Very loud and lots of parking,This stadium is a great place for football. The atmosphere is so full and when this stadium is packed it is very loud.
1043,Date of experience: September 2017,11-Oct-17,ACC,NC State,5,Beautiful facility,There was no game when we came by but we still had to see it and loved the wolfpack statue(s) before one of the entrances to the stadium. Each of the six wolves stand for something and it's nice to have that kind of guidepost for daily life.
1044,Date of experience: October 2017,7-Oct-17,ACC,NC State,5,Football!,"Our first college football game and WOW!!! The school spirit is overwhelming and really gets you involved. Beautiful, gigantic stadium. Easy to navigate, well marked and many friendly helpful workers. They put on quite a show on football night. Loved the wolf howling!"
1045,Date of experience: November 2016,27-Sep-17,ACC,NC State,5,Home of the Wolfpack,This is the beautiful stadium-home of NC State's Wolfpack.  It has ample seating for a huge crowd and tailgating there is so much fun!  Wear your red & white for a day of fun!
1046,Date of experience: September 2017,15-Sep-17,ACC,NC State,4,Go see State paly football in a nice stadium  :),"Our family has been able to have season tickets to State football this year as our youngest child is a Freshman at NCSU.  Enjoyed the State vs. Marshall game last weekend and will be attending the State vs. Furman this weekend.  Everything about the stadium is good.  Getting there is not too bad.  Getting out can take a while just due to traffic but everyone works to make it go as smoothly as possible.  The stadium is well maintained and easy to navigate.  Restroom are kept clean, and there are multiple food, drink, and snack choices are available once you are in the stadium.  Go State!!!"
1047,Date of experience: September 2017,11-Sep-17,ACC,NC State,5,Great game!,We thoroughly enjoyed our experience at Carter-Finley.  Staff was helpful and courteous and we are always glad to be with our fellow wolfpackers cheering on the pack.
1048,Date of experience: October 2016,25-May-17,ACC,NC State,5,Outstanding Football Atmosphere,"Easily the best College Football Atmosphere in North Carolina and one of the best in the South. The stadium sits on University property along with the PNC Center next to the NC State Fairgrounds in West Raleigh and in surrounded by about 10,000 numbered parking spots. There are no bad seats in the entire facility. Quick and easy to get into and out of. Tailgating is outstanding and only a few stadiums in the country surpass it."
1049,Date of experience: September 2016,6-Apr-17,ACC,NC State,5,Wolfpack IN the House!,"My alma mater. What can I say about Carter Finley? It was built in in 1966 and now has a seating capacity of 57,583. All I can say is if you are ever in Raleigh on a warm fall day try tailgating with the friendlist people in the South. We will offer you some Bojangles chicken and a beer to wash it down with"
1050,Date of experience: November 2016,9-Dec-16,ACC,NC State,4,Good Stadium,"We had season tickets to NC State Football Games this year and really enjoyed our time at Carter Finley.  It's an older stadium, but it's well kept and always fun on game day.  We're lucky to have such great facilities in our area that people can enjoy.  Our seats were the second row from the very top, but even from up there the views are great."
1051,Date of experience: November 2016,24-Nov-16,ACC,NC State,4,Great atmosphere!,"The stadium is clean and spacious and the field is well-maintained. The weather was unpredictable when we went, but it was totally worth the game. My only complaint is that the rows and seat numbers need to be clearly labeled. We sat in seats that we thought were ours because we couldn't really read the numbers or letters on the seats. Turns out, we were way further up in the middle of the row. Also, the bleachers are extremely uncomfortable and I highly recommend getting seats or choosing the sections with chairs available. Other than that, the stadium was great and the game was even better!"
1052,Date of experience: November 2016,20-Nov-16,ACC,NC State,2,Needs help and a few hundred signs,"Football game- Parking and directions for football was confusing with no signs. Directions to gates were vague. Then try to find you seats in the upper deck.   Wow, sections have the  seat numbers start in the middle from the stairs. Yea go figure how the decided to do it that way. Then on top of it the numbers of the seats are basically invisible as they have been rubbed off by the 10000 behinds. Don't expect any usher to help you, there aren't any, and security guards don't know anything about the seating arrangements.  Obviously not happy with the organization, but the game was fun."
1053,Date of experience: November 2016,11-Nov-16,ACC,NC State,4,Game Night!,"Went to the FSU/NCS game and we really enjoyed the halftime show for veterans, all the students were great."
1054,Date of experience: October 2016,2-Nov-16,ACC,NC State,5,GREAT EXPERIENCE,"Just returned from a football game - everyone was very friendly and helpful, stadium was very nice and all seats seemed to have good views.  Just a reminder that they do have a limit on the size of your purse so use a clear bag for anything that you would like to bring into the game."
1055,Date of experience: October 2016,31-Oct-16,ACC,NC State,1,Poor Organization,"The seating is so poorly labeled we had to ask for directions, and even the ushers had difficulty.  They also do not let Uber drivers ANYWHERE near the stadium.  It was insane that we had to walk over a mile to find our driver given the whole point is that we are driven.  It was absolutely ridiculous. Terrible organization of everything at this stadium."
1056,Date of experience: September 2016,8-Sep-16,ACC,NC State,5,WOLFPACK FOOTBALL!,This is one of THE BEST experiences you could have in Raleigh!  The Wolfpack football experience is so exciting.  Game days are filled with fun and fellowship!  You'll meet tons of new people and get to see one of the best teams in college football!   GO WOLFPACK!
1057,Date of experience: September 2016,4-Sep-16,ACC,NC State,4,Visitor to an NC State football game,"Here to see NC State football on a dreary Thursday night game.  Unless you are a season ticket holder, be prepared to walk up to a mile on uneven surfaces to get to the stadium.  Walk includes route through rowdy students tailgating; if you are wearing the opposing team's color, be prepared for some foul language from drunks. Once at the stadium, however, I was very impressed with the beautiful and modern interior.  Helpful staff. Good signage. Modern and clean bathrooms.  No bad seats in the house."
1058,Date of experience: November 2015,20-Aug-16,ACC,NC State,3,"Average college football stadium, but there is always tailgating!","The food is mediocre, but you can bring a grill and cook your own at your parking space. No alcohol is allowed, but discreet folks rarely get grief. The food inside is a very small selection, so at least take your own sandwiches. You cannot take any food or drink in to the stadium, so do get there early and tailgate, the way NCSU has been playing, that's more fun than the game."
1060,Date of experience: November 2015,19-Jul-16,ACC,NC State,5,My Favorite Place - Go PACK,"This place is very special to Wolfpack fans.  The stadium has really grown over the years and I am forturnate to have been there to grow with it.  It now seats close to 60,000 and when we have Florida State, Miami, ECU or UNC in the house it is LOUD.  The Wolfpack nation is not fair weather - we support in good and bad.  It is a great Saturday or Thursday night event."
1065,Date of experience: December 2015,29-Dec-15,ACC,NC State,5,Go Wolfpack,"Great facility. Easy access, right off interstate 40. Lots of food venues. Home of the Hurricanes complete with a retail store. Nice restrooms.  All seats are good."
1066,Date of experience: November 2015,31-Oct-15,ACC,NC State,3,Football,Fall college football is big thing in the south every time we can go to a game we doNice stadium  it has had some updates but could use more seats and the ones that are there are very close together better lighting for night games and events that accrue here
1067,Date of experience: August 2015,14-Oct-15,ACC,NC State,5,Go Wolfpack,Large area with lots of parking. Hosts many football events. Has area hotels nearby. Many nice eating places in the area. Close to downtown Raleigh
1069,Date of experience: September 2015,15-Sep-15,ACC,NC State,4,GREAT PLACE FOR A FOOTBALL GAME,"I'm an NC State alum and hadn't been to the stadium since it was revamped. It's really beautiful and a great place to watch football, just wish I could've had a beer."
1077,Date of experience: November 2014,3-Jul-15,ACC,NC State,5,Football and Tailgating,Carter Finely is very lively on Game Day. NC STATE Football is huge in Raleigh and everyone should catch a game of they can.  There is plenty of seating and Tailgating on game day is a sight to see.
1081,Date of experience: October 2014,29-Jun-15,ACC,NC State,4,Fantastic seats,"It is always fun to go and watch the Wolfpack play.  Very professional. Variety of food, easy access, plenty of parking and tailgating. It's a good time."
1082,Date of experience: December 2014,3-Jun-15,ACC,NC State,5,Whats not to like?,tailgating is great at this place for Wolfpack games. TONS of fun  most seats are good in the stadium the pre game show is great jets fly over ahead over all a  great time even if you don't ;like footall.  Sometimes the team is actually good too...
1087,Date of experience: December 2014,8-Mar-15,ACC,NC State,5,The Upgrades Are Awesome!!!!!,"When I walked into Carter Finley after the upgrades were complete, I almost hyperventilated it was so awesome. It is one of the top facilities in the country from the sky boxes to the field house.  The architects did a great job of keeping the old and blending it with the new. It is beautiful. Putting the PNC Arena close to Carter-Finley only adds to the beauty of the property and takes advantage of joint parking."
1089,Date of experience: October 2014,18-Feb-15,ACC,NC State,4,Great stadium Great Crowd.,"I have watched many NCSU Football games here and it's a great stadium. Staff is very friendly and food is good although  very limited. Seats are good but a bit tight. Being there with all those great college students is a great experience.Evacuating the entire stadium for a severe t-storm was a bit weird, wet and inconvenient."
1090,Date of experience: November 2014,31-Jan-15,ACC,NC State,5,Outstanding football experience,"The game day experience at Carter Finley is by far the best in North Carolina and one of the best in the country. Not a bad seat in the stadium makes for a great place to watch a football game. Sure at just under 60,000 seats it's not as big as a lot of other stadiums but it definitely is as loud as those larger ones. Plenty of concession stands and bathrooms. CF looks smaller then it is from the outside because the entire lower bowl is below ground. That means no super long climbs to get to even the top rows. Parking in the immediate vicinity surrounding CF & the PNC Arena is for season ticket holders and all 10,000 spots are numbered. You have the same sport all year. This means you can show up at game time and your spot will be open. Students park across Trinity Rd in the State Fairgrounds parking lots. Visitors can easily find cheap or even free parking with no more than 1/4 mile walk to the stadium. There is not another stadium in the ACC that has the same amount of close in parking. Tailgating is huge and very friendly. I have been to college football games all around the country and the atmosphere at CF is right there with the best of them."
1091,Date of experience: September 2014,17-Nov-14,ACC,NC State,5,AWESOME!,Lovely experience! Good ambiance! Good food / drinks!Good seats for a good deal!Loved it and definitely would do it over again!
1092,Date of experience: November 2014,10-Nov-14,ACC,NC State,3,Nice small stadium,"We go to all the UGA and Ga Tech games. Came here for GT vs NC St. Parking was easy. Easy access to our seats. Concessions looked good and very organized. But the large screen was used for public serve announcements and advertisements during timeouts and breaks. Always blasting out music and not allowing the Wolfpack Marching Band to play. Frankly, it was a little boring. At Ga Tech the band plays anytime there is not a play being executed. At UGA, they show scores from around the nation on the BIG board along with lookins from other games during timeouts. The Marching Bands entertain the crowds in the state of Georgia. One other thing, WHERE DID YOU GET THAT PUBLIC ADDRESS ANNOUNCER, HE'S AWFUL."
1094,Date of experience: October 2013,9-Sep-14,ACC,NC State,4,Even if you don't root for NC State; a game here is an experience!!,"Even if you don't root for NC State; a game here is an experience!!The place usually packs 60,0000 plus here.Concessions are affordable and available in mass.Parking is $10-20 per game with plenty of free parking options nearby -- if you are willing to walk a little. Clean venue, safe for families and children.Helpful staff.Amazing energy!!"
1095,Date of experience: August 2014,3-Sep-14,ACC,NC State,5,A Nice Hometown Venue,"The beauty of Carter Finley, much like the PNC Center next door, is that although you are there to watch major college sports, it has a great hometown feel. The facility staff and concessioneers are all very hospitable. Parking and traffic is really pretty good for a sports stadium. Seats are good and fans are courteous.For NC State Creamery ice cream, go to a concession stand along the brick wall on the South side of the stadium. Yum!"
1096,Date of experience: November 2013,15-Mar-14,ACC,NC State,4,Best Football Stadium in the Triangle,"I am partial on this one but NC State has a significantly better atmosphere for football than any of its rivals in the Triangle.  The tailgating and in game experience is much more lively at Carter Finley.  If you get a chance to catch a fall football game while in town, it is well worth the trip."
1097,Date of experience: November 2013,29-Jan-14,ACC,NC State,3,"Nice folks, but couldn't hear the PA!","My first visit to this stadium was back in November when my beloved Tar Heels played the Wolfpack.  I was actually quite impressed with the facility.  There didn't seem to be a bad seat in the house.  We were on the top level and had a great view.  I loved the huge scoreboard and all the displays that were easily viewed from our seats.  However, the announcing system was terrible!  Sometimes it was so quiet when the crowd got loud that you couldn't hear a thing, which was frustrating!  I know stadiums get loud, but when I'm at a UNC home game, we can certainly still hear our announcer over any crowd noise.  I felt like I couldn't hear penalties, subs, or plays for half the game.  It seemed to go in and out as well, so even when we could hear, it seemed to cut in and out.  My little section consulted each other to figure out what was going on since we couldn't hear the announcing.Despite such a heated matchup, I found the NCSU folks to be quite nice.  I was impressed with the wide variety of concessions and, as a previous review said, I liked how they give you a separate cup of ice with your drink so you're not paying for a soda and getting half a cup of ice for the money you paid.  This stadium is certainly a placed I'd visit again for a game and would recommend to others as well.  Just please fix the PA system!"
1098,Date of experience: November 2013,5-Jan-14,ACC,NC State,4,Very nice facility.,We attended a UNC-NCSU football game and we pleased to find the staff very helpful. Lots of law enforcement to prevent any potential rivalry flare ups. Like the use of cups of ice and 1/2 liter drinks. Allows you to pour as you need refills.
1099,Date of experience: November 2013,30-Nov-13,ACC,NC State,5,Awesome venue!,"Kids of all ages!  Check out the Wolfpack and get here early.  Lots of tailgating going on...translates into a lot of traffic, but with a little planning & patience, its a good time!"
1100,Date of experience: September 2013,24-Sep-13,ACC,NC State,5,Great Experience,"Went to my first NC State game the other week and it happened to be verse Clemson. Even though the refs screwed the Wolfpack on many occasion, they couldnt screw my Wife and I out of a great experience. We got tickets on StubHub that came with a parking pass close to the stadium. Seats right on the 40 on the upper east side. Fantastic seats. Once inside the stadium, we realized we were in a special place. Outside reminds me of Jack Trice in Ames as I am a Cyclone fan. Im talking about the concourse and the parking area. Great place to tailgate and great location. Parking took awhile afterwards, but what do you expect when you have 63k+. Cant wait to go back."
1101,Date of experience: September 2013,19-Sep-13,ACC,NC State,5,Quality stadium,"This stadium is well organized, easy to get in and out and a fun environment also. The NC State football office is in front of it and there is a gorgeous Wolfpack waterfall to view at the entry."
1104,Date of experience: November 2012,6-Dec-12,ACC,NC State,5,"Aside from a lousy game, this is a great stadium!",we had seats with a back to them so it was very comfortable. The game we came to see was lousy but you can't blame the stadium for that. i think this is a very nice stadium and enjoy going to games here
1105,Date of experience: September 2023,5 days ago,ACC,Syracuse,4,Smoothly Run,"My wife, I and my friend went to the Dome for a football game.  The game itself wasn't very competitive but this is a review of the Dome.  There was a typo on the website for the directions to the parking at Skytop lot.  That is the lot that you are directed to if you don't have a season pass.  Traveling from the south, the website says you want to take W. Brighton but you really want E. Brighton.  I had looked on Google map before we got there but otherwise that could have been confusing.  The shuttle bus from the lot to the dome was pretty smooth.  You do walk a pretty good distance from the bus drop off to the dome, it felt much shorter when we left.  Not sure if that was true or if was an illusion.  You definitely walk a good distance though.  We arrived at the parking lot about 75 minutes before the game and with potty stops and the walks we ended up arriving at our seats about 30 minutes before the game.  Entry is a little tricky into the seat.  You definitely want to check on your ticket to make sure you enter the right gate.  With that it was pretty easy but I could see that if you just enter a gate it could be challenging.  You go through a metal detector.  I got buzzed for keys and phone and then again for eye glass case.  That seemed maybe a little too sensitive but I guess better safe then sorry.Departure after the game was a little tricky but as long as you followed the crowd and remember which lot you were in, it wasn't too bad.  I think they could have had a few markers to help you find your car in the lot.  We got there after probably more then half the cars had left and it was still a little tricky.  Inside the seats were pretty good and reasonably priced, at least in our case.   Concessions were a little high but I sadly think that is true now.  I know it is a college atmosphere but it did seem artificially boosted a little.Overall it was much simpler and enjoyable experience then I was expecting."
1108,Date of experience: August 2023,4 weeks ago,ACC,Syracuse,2,Our First And Last Visit,"Our experience here last weekend was pretty much exactly what other reviewers have written. We went to see two of three bands there last Saturday (had to stay to the end b/c the band we didn't care for was second) and I was pretty stiff by the time the final band came out. As others have described, the seats in this place are steel, seating and the backs, so if you buy a seat you may also want to bring a really good cushion.Also, by the time they came on, something was done to the sound system for their performance and it sounded like crap. Others have described this as well. After all that garbage to get in there, we ended up leaving early.  Even the experience getting into this place was difficult. And warm and/or fuzzy? Not here! I was turned away from the first ""gate"" by a rent-a-guard who told me that ""my bag is too big to come in here."" I purposely brought a small bag to this event; I needed to keep track of their phone, keys, and ID and needed something to carry them in! Mr. Rent-a-guard also informed me that they allowed ""clear bags only."" Upon looking around at others going in, I saw exactly one clear bag that whole night, and plenty of women with backpacks or cross body bags the same size OR LARGER than the one I had. So, we were sent around to ""Gate D "" where Mr. Rental told me that ""I could get a locker"". We walked almost around that entire building (which is huge) trying to find this Gate D. Never did see it. Hubby told me to try getting in at Gate N, which had much kindlier people staffing it. An older gentleman only looked in my bag before allowing us entry. And, when I had another problem trying to get the mobile app on my phone to open (it never did) to produce their ""mobile entry only tickets,"" I was then only steps away from the box office, where he eventually printed the magical tickets for me. So despite all of the warnings and restrictions that you have to read before (and after) making your overpriced purchase for this place, ""mobile entry only"" isn't strictly true. With all of the garbage fees these venues and their third party partners charge for the privilege of spending your hard earned money on, they should be practically kissing your feet when you visit there (and pay inflated prices to park as well). Count me out for every visiting again. Not worth my time, gas, nor aggravation!"
1109,Date of experience: August 2023,4 weeks ago,ACC,Syracuse,4,Worth a visit,"The acoustics aren??t great but what can you expect from a football field? The seats aren??t comfortable, they??re bleacher benches but if you get lucky you??ll end up with one of the padded seats from season ticket holders. This place is very well run with professional employees and capable security including many police officers on standby."
1113,Date of experience: September 2022,26-Sep-22,ACC,Syracuse,1,Painfully inadequate sound system,My wife and I attended the Purdue football game. The metal benches are a little uncomfortable and the concessions are expensive but I expect that. The sound system is horrendous. We couldn??t understand anything being said by the announcer or during the video clips. The university should hire a competent sound technician to revamp the whole system. If they scrap the whole Bose system and put speakers closer to the people it would be a much better experience. The dome itself is also dangerously loud. During the game the noise level rarely went below 80 decibels (and up to 107). Long term exposure to such levels (30 minutes or more) will damage hearing. Hearing protection should be recommended.
1114,Date of experience: September 2022,24-Sep-22,ACC,Syracuse,4,Some nice improvements in the past 2 years.,"The newly named JMA Wireless Dome will always be ""The Dome"" as far as this Syracuse University alum is concerned. Finally, there is air conditioning in the building which is important as it used to get very hot and humid inside.  The food prices at the concession stands are expensive - like any other stadium - but the service is pretty good. They keep the line moving.  Sound system is still lacking -- too much echo.  If you are lucky your seats will have the padding from a season ticket holder.  Those seats are really comfortable.  Otherwise, it's painful aluminum benches.  The outside of the building is beautiful at night and the improvements to the roof have allowed for a far more comfortable exit from the building.  Gone are the days of a wind tunnel blowing you out the doors at the end of the game."
1117,Date of experience: September 2022,11-Sep-22,ACC,Syracuse,1,Terrible venue!!,"Saw Elton John. Wonderful show but terrible organization from the minute we entered the grounds. We had floor seats arrived, 1.5 hours on the grounds prior to the start time and still missed the first song. The entrances had no knowledgeable staff to help direct people to the appropriate entrance. The hallways had no staff to direct people directionally or safely. It was a dangerous situation with many crowd and fire laws broken. Multiple people with medical emergencies because of the poor conditions. Shame on you Syracuse University for making a fun event into a dangerous situation for vulnerable people."
1118,Date of experience: September 2022,11-Sep-22,ACC,Syracuse,1,Terrible Venue,"Saw Elton John last night Amazing show, horrific venue! I don??t understand how it is not a safety hazard to have so many people packed in the hallways. God forbid if there was a fire or emergency situation. You are literally packed in like sardines. Acoustics are terrible. There was an echo throughout the show. Parking is way too expensive! $25 to park miles away and ride an overcrowded shuttle. The wait to get on the shuttles after the show are ridiculous! Don??t waste your time or money. I would rather travel to a different venue then experience a show here again!"
1126,Date of experience: October 2021,23-Jan-22,ACC,Syracuse,3,Expensive concessions,"Had issues with our tickets and was stuck at the box office for a while and missed the tip off. Otherwise, the game was fun. Concession prices have gone up tremendously. The price of my favorite nachos is insane!"
1128,Date of experience: November 2021,1-Dec-21,ACC,Syracuse,4,Good College football atmosphere,"Recently saw a football game at the Doom, Pitt vs. Syracuse. The Doom had a good college football atmosphere. Nice college Game Day vibe. Although I have a couple of negative points. First, very limited food selections and parking is horrible. Be prepared to walk."
1129,Date of experience: October 2021,15-Oct-21,ACC,Syracuse,1,NY sold out in the ACC.,We have attended games here for 6 years (Every other). The new renovation was nice but the seats will only fit a size 0 butt. Then the whole mask and vaccine requirement for an ACC school. Never will I return. New rules show based on attendance.
1132,Date of experience: November 2019,30-Dec-19,ACC,Syracuse,3,Disappointing overall,"I've always wanted to visit the iconic Carrier Dome, and live about 2.5 hours away, so when I was given tickets for Syracuse basketball, I took the opportunity. Just to walk to the Dome from the parking lot below was probably the equivalent of climbing about 6 stories worth of stairs and ramps - luckily the weather was unusually mild, because the climb would've been brutal in cold, snowy, windy weather. The Dome itself was older and shabbier than I expected: dimly lit concourses and bathrooms, limited concessions, just drab overall. The arena area itself was bright and the seats were comfortable, but it's not the best place to watch a basketball game - and we had ""good"" seats. Disappointing in general - but glad I did get to finally go.."
1133,Date of experience: October 2019,6-Nov-19,ACC,Syracuse,5,First visit... truly and experience to remember,"Even during major construction, the SU football game at the Dome was wonderful.  We knew not to try to park anywhere near it so we took an Uber and walked the rest of the way.  It was a beautiful sunny day so the stroll was pleasant.  The place is amazing.  There are food, beverage stand and restrooms near every entrance level.  We did leave early to beat the crowds exiting and also to get great seats down the street at Faegan's."
1134,Date of experience: October 2019,30-Oct-19,ACC,Syracuse,5,Carrier Dome Event New York State Field Band Conference (Competition) 10/27/2019,"General Seating:I got to sit in one of those orange seats, which you can see in the photo. An orange seat is an aluminum seat with a bottom and back pad.Most seats are now unpadded. All seats have backs, but no armrests.The temperature in the Dome was nicely cool.The huge skylight let us all know when it had stopped raining and the sun was shining."
1135,Date of experience: September 2019,14-Oct-19,ACC,Syracuse,3,Clemson-Syracuse football,"The Carrier Dome is exciting to see and the field area/stands/atmosphere are first-rate, The walkways, restrooms, concession areas are small, crowded, dated and need renovation. Amazingly, named for the Carrier Co. it is not air-conditioned and was stuffy and can be very hot."
1136,Date of experience: September 2019,16-Sep-19,ACC,Syracuse,3,Older stadium,"Was here for Clemson/Syracuse game that was sold out and was very crowded, hot inside and tough to get any refreshments.  Dome does not have ample parking, built in middle of campus.  Just a heads up for any newbies to the dome"
1137,Date of experience: August 2018,24-May-19,ACC,Syracuse,4,Great arena.,"I had the unexpected pleasure of being in the Carrier Dome, on the field when it was virtually empty. My college football team was able to practice here on the way to Rochester. The turf was in great shape and I love the lines of this old building."
1141,Date of experience: January 2019,14-Jan-19,ACC,Syracuse,5,"Nice place, but Syracuse lost!","We went to see a Syracuse game this weekend, which was fun but SU lost. Also, we had seats that were directly underneath the 3rd deck overhang, so it felt a little bit cramped.  Here's a helpful hint:  if you are a Veteran (or police or fire fighter), you can park for free right across the street in the VA Hospital parking lot."
1142,Date of experience: November 2018,13-Nov-18,ACC,Syracuse,4,Fun place to see a game! Plan ahead though...,"I recently attended a Syracuse Orange Football game at Carrier Dome. The atmosphere is fun and electric as nearly 40,000 fans were in attendance and well behaved! The venue is aging and could use some upgrades. There are a lot of stairs to walk up/down here so be prepared. If you are traveling to the arena, you may want to plan ahead. Traffic 90 minutes before kickoff was crazy and quite congested. I would recommend you plan out your parking area ahead of time too. I was told that there were shuttles from some lots that would take you up to the dome and parking was only $15. We parked in a Medical facility parking garage for $25 and had to walk quite a steep hill and what felt like 100 stairs. Staff was friendly and helpful to us. I will come back to the Dome again and will definitely plan this trip out carefully."
1143,Date of experience: October 2018,1-Nov-18,ACC,Syracuse,3,Definitely in need of renovation,"This was our third visit each 2 years apart to see a football game. It is absolutely in need of renovation. The concourses are dark and tight. Concession stands are not bad but they put more emphasis on selling beer rather than food. The men's restrooms are way outdated and were quite dirty. There are a lot of ushers and security personnel but they don't seem to do very much. We had a number of Syracuse students/fans sit in our visitor section without tickets and were quite rowdy. The language they were using has no place around the kids that were there. The ushers refused to do anything about the situation. It finally took a police officer to calm them down and about half left when he came over. Parking around the dome is virtually non-existent. Most of the seats have decent views of the field but if you are sitting in the top 2 rows of the lower bowl on either end zone you cannot see all the video board, either of the score boards or all of the field. There may have been 30-35,000 fans at most in a facility that holds 49,000."
1144,Date of experience: September 2018,24-Sep-18,ACC,Syracuse,5,Great place to see a game,"What can you say??a trip to The Dome to see Syracuse play is always fun. We visited on their Veteran??s Day to see SU play UConn in football. It is a fantastic place to catch a game because you always feel like you are up close to the game. The concessions are also good, and not super-high priced like in some places. We had a really good time, and SU won by 30 points. What could be better?"
1145,Date of experience: September 2018,17-Sep-18,ACC,Syracuse,5,If the Dome is a rockin......,"Great place for a game, especially when SU is beating Florida State in front of 40,000 screaming fans or in front of record breaking crowds and SU is beating Duke in basketball.  Down side is no A/C but that is being rectified under the recently announced $116MM renovation plan.  A/C will be done by 2022."
1147,Date of experience: October 2017,4-Mar-18,ACC,Syracuse,5,Great experience,Went to the Pitt vs Cuse football game. Great game and environment. Always seen a basketball game in the dome.
1150,Date of experience: December 2017,11-Dec-17,ACC,Syracuse,5,Great place to see a game!,"I went here to see the Syracuse Men's Basketball team play Colgate this past weekend, and I had a great time with everything. The dome has great seats surrounding the entire court, and all seats have a pretty good view of the playing area. The lighting is good, and the concessions surrounding the seats offer a pretty good variety of things to eat and drink. One thing I would  recommend for anyone who is a Veteran is the free parking you get right across the street, in the VA hospital parking garage. Take advantage of it if you can!"
1151,Date of experience: September 2017,29-Sep-17,ACC,Syracuse,2,HOT and UNCOMFORTABLE,"This is the most uncomfortable venue I have ever been in. There are no personal seats....all bleachers. So your assigned ""seat"" size may be greatly reduced if there are large people in your row. Then there's the unbearable heat with no cooling system whatsoever. You'd most certainly think that the Carrier Dome named for the Carrier Heating and Cooling Services might actually have heat or cooling systems. They have neither. I won't be visiting that venue again!"
1156,Date of experience: September 2017,17-Sep-17,ACC,Syracuse,5,Game day,My wife and I went to the dome to watch an SU football game. We had great seats and the game did not disappoint us.  The fans we electric and the energy in the dome was awesome.  It was warm and I heard several people complaining of the heat.  It was also in the 80s outside though.
1157,Date of experience: September 2017,9-Sep-17,ACC,Syracuse,5,SU football,Great place to watch a game without the price of pro football!!  Good food and beer while also being family friendly
1159,Date of experience: August 2017,29-Aug-17,ACC,Syracuse,5,Convenient arena,Just visited Syracuse and wanted to see what the famous dome was all about. The place is well planned and very easy access to get to. I'm still unsure where everybody parks when there's a huge event but they sure made it easy for everybody to get in and out. Facilities are clean and the whole place is well maintained.
1163,Date of experience: January 2017,18-Jan-17,ACC,Syracuse,4,Wow! What fun!,"Have seen football there but basketball was a whole different game.  Very crowded and they pack them in - almost 22,000 that night. Great fans. Hard to get tickets unless you know someone or want to pay big bucks from secondary source. One aisle leads to 25 seats across so it's only one way in and out. Cold night so we had heavy coats but so hot in the Dome."
1164,Date of experience: September 2016,8-Jan-17,ACC,Syracuse,5,Stunning stadium,"Stunning stadium to watch sports in and visit. Comfortable seats, plenty of room, good service facilities and close to the action."
1165,Date of experience: November 2016,5-Jan-17,ACC,Syracuse,5,Football Game,"Always a blast at The Dome! 1st time for a football game and we had an awesome time. Defiantly not the same vibe as a basketball game but it was cool to see all the fun stuff going on outside. I have always found the staff to be awesome and very helpful. The food is basic stadium fare but no other stadium has Hoffman hot dogs or Gianelli  sausage. Beers are pricey but who cares, it's an awesome day at The Dome!"
1166,Date of experience: December 2016,4-Jan-17,ACC,Syracuse,5,Check one off my Bucket List!!,"This is one of the remaining mystique of college basketball.   There is something about this place when walking into it, especially if you are the 'other team'.   Great facility, which is massive!!!  A++ on the fact that the site sells alcohol.  Great environment overall!!"
1167,Date of experience: November 2016,7-Dec-16,ACC,Syracuse,5,Absolutely great venue!!!,"A large venue and you can see every play and replay on the big screen. It is indoor so no worrying about weather. I went when the snow was on the ground and it was WARM inside this huge building! But walk around and look at all the different people who have played or performed there. There is also a historic window box with the oldest pigskin football that was dated 1921, if I recall correctly! What a blast!"
1168,Date of experience: November 2016,21-Nov-16,ACC,Syracuse,5,Very nice place go see a game!,"I went to the Done to see the Syracuse basketball team take on Monmouth last week, and I was impressed by just how well the Dome is holding up. It's over 35 years old now, yet everything that I saw was still bright, clean and well-maintained. The services in and around the stadium are all still great, and I had no trouble finding my seat. (The ice cream stand there has great flavors, too!) The seating was perfect, and I had an unobstructed view of the game. The stadium can be configured in one of any number of ways, and I don't think there was a bad seat in the house for the basketball game. i would love to go back sometime."
1169,Date of experience: November 2016,16-Nov-16,ACC,Syracuse,3,Needs to be updated,"It looks just like it did when we were there 2 years ago. It's 36 years old and badly in need of the updating that is supposed to start in the Spring of 2017. The bench seats are going to be replaced with real seats. Hopefully the bathrooms will get a complete overhaul. They are way outdated and are not very plentiful. We had to walk a quarter of the way around the concourse to find them. Then stand in long lines. Likewise the concession stands need a lot of work. They will not be able to fix them, but the rise in steps is way too high. A good 2 inches higher than they should be. There are no rails to hold onto when going up or down the steep stairs. Hopefully they will be installed in the updating. The Dome itself sits on top of a steep hill and parking is almost non-existent. We were the visiting team and a lot of people had to park many blocks away. I was lucky in that the VA Hospital directly across the street from the Dome has a parking garage and if you have a Military ID you can park there for free. Plus there is an elevator 1/2 block away that you can ride up to the level of the Dome and walk across the elevated walkway over Irving St to the Dome. I will say the staff was very friendly and helpful. Sight lines are pretty good from anywhere in the Dome. We were told it would be extremely noisy but that never happened. I don't think it was ever more than about 2/3's full at any point."
1170,Date of experience: November 2016,13-Nov-16,ACC,Syracuse,3,OK Place to Watch a Game,The dome is at Syracuse University. It is all uphill to get to it.Which means it's downhill leaving. As a place to see a game it's alright. We were in the end zone where they put the visitors. The main downside is the lack of washrooms in the area None on the end which meant going around to one side or the other. Long lineups even for the men's washroom.We will be back again in 2 years when our team returns. Go Pack.
1171,Date of experience: October 2016,31-Oct-16,ACC,Syracuse,4,Good lines of sight,The parking lot leads to a steep set of stairs but look to see if you could use the ramp which is easier. The bathrooms were clean and the staff friendly - a bonus in such a large setting.
1172,Date of experience: September 2016,21-Oct-16,ACC,Syracuse,4,Tourists should all experience a fun University Football Game in Action,"This dome is well laid out, very large and so easy to see from even the furthest seat. We haven't been to another city where the fans so completely wear their team colors. All ages, all demographics come to the game in orange garb. We were hesitant about going, we had heard and read online that parking is a nightmare and that the wait is so long yet coming from Canada we are used to that. We went anyway and were not disappointed. We parked on a side street which was only 5 blocks from the dome and worth the walk to see the many university parties taking place pre-game along the way. The tailgaters in action and the energy in the air was a true experience. The gorgeous grounds of Syracuse University were filled with freshman as excited as we were to be there.The campus itself was gorgeous and we happened to visit on the Labour Day weekend full of excitement and parades and alumni and BBQs. Once inside the dome, we knew this was one of the better attractions Syracuse has to offer. I should note the food inside the dome was standard fare, pizza, burgs, sausages, icecream - nothing contemporary but it was tasty.Take the time, park on the street, get tickets to the game, go early and just take it all in. We'll be back for another game soon!"
1174,Date of experience: September 2016,6-Oct-16,ACC,Syracuse,4,Done the Dome!,"How many times we have passed the Dome in Syracuse on way to taking our kids to colleges upstate for 9 years straight!  Well, our wish to see it finally came true when our Athletic Director daughter had the school football team play their season opening game at The Dome!We were so happy to walk the many many steps up to the Dome and loved the interior!  Put a big smile on our faces to say we've Done the Dome!  You should do it too!"
1175,Date of experience: October 2016,5-Oct-16,ACC,Syracuse,2,"Service Personnel are good, Dome seats are horrible",as a venue to watch a football or Concert  the seats are small benches. if you get there too late you have to squeeze in.  Syracuse University needs to rip all the benches out of the Dome.  Add real seats you pay a fortune to see an event stop being so cheap.   Yes also add some more Women's Bathrooms too!
1176,Date of experience: September 2016,17-Sep-16,ACC,Syracuse,5,Another day in the dome,When the renovations happen this place will be awesome. The whole environment is great it can just be hot Enjoy the Cuse and have fun
1177,Date of experience: October 2015,12-Sep-16,ACC,Syracuse,5,Was at the first game!,"Some of the greatest times of my life were spent in this building...back from 1980 to 1984. Have been a few times since...into this century. Would love to see it rocking for football again some day, but NO better place for basketball in the country."
1178,Date of experience: September 2016,6-Sep-16,ACC,Syracuse,4,SU Football,The Dome is a great place to see a game.  Granted it is getting up there in age but it still gets rockin from time to time.  The bench seating is marginal and it can get packed moving about for food.  It's loud and even better for basketball than football.
1179,Date of experience: August 2016,30-Aug-16,ACC,Syracuse,4,In the heart of SU,"In the center of the university, it's a very impressive building, even if you don't get to go inside. You can take a walk around it and see lots of nice architecture."
1180,Date of experience: August 2016,30-Aug-16,ACC,Syracuse,3,Good sporting venue,"There seem to be no bad seats, but there are some major bottlenecks in moving between levels. They are planning to put a hard roof on and add A/C, thankfully, as the events held there in August were so incredibly hot. The event staff is fabulous - friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable."
1181,Date of experience: August 2016,13-Aug-16,ACC,Syracuse,5,Great and exciting place,Great college arena with lots of energy and noise It's right on campus and very convenient for the students Pretty cool how loud it gets
1182,Date of experience: December 2015,7-Aug-16,ACC,Syracuse,3,Always great atmosphere but kind of boring and outdated as venue.,"Love going to events here for locale and surrounding neighborhood, but definitely could use some sprucing up/remodel.."
1183,Date of experience: August 2016,4-Aug-16,ACC,Syracuse,5,Ride4Gabe,The people of the Carrier Dome were so generous with their time and gift to our team with Ride4Gabe. They were super!
1187,Date of experience: November 2015,8-Feb-16,ACC,Syracuse,4,Nice sports complex,For any sporting event the view and experience is very fun. No on site parking but parking is 1 mile away you can walk to it but they do have free shuttle before and after the event. The can be a pain after the game depending on the the mass of people. Parking is like $20.00 per car. The stadium has good sound and okay big screens. The bathrooms are big but probably the worst in any stadiums the mens rooms. The food is your basic sports food nothing fancy the carrier Dome is one of few college stadiums that sells beer and wine. It is also one of the few on campus stadiums and about one of the only the has a air roof. The carrier Dome is a fun way to experience any sporting event. The staff is helpful and feel safe it has free Wi-Fi to.
1188,Date of experience: January 2016,31-Jan-16,ACC,Syracuse,4,Syracuse vs Georgia Tech,It was actually not as painful as expected.  Parking for the most part is available around $25. If you don't have a parking pass that's ok there's a parking garage a little more than a hundred yards from the dome itself.  Take exit 17 not 18. It will tell you to take 18 on Google maps but that takes you to roads that will be closed by police or security.  Drinks are reasonably priced and food is ok.  All in all a great experience for kids and adults.
1189,Date of experience: January 2016,11-Jan-16,ACC,Syracuse,3,Syracuse vs UNC B-Ball,"We went up to Syracuse for the UNC Tarheels basketball game.  We parked at the Manley Field house and took the shuttle to the Dome.  There was about a 1/4 mile walk from the drop off point to gate N.  Once we were inside we had to walk around the dome to 208.  Seat were great for the game.  But the seats were bleachers..very hard unless you have the season ticket holder cushions.  My big concern was the steps down to the seats.  The first step had to have a drop of 12 to 14 inches and all the rest were 10-12.  I have RA of the hips and climbing stairs is difficult but these were impossible.  It took two people to help me back up the stairs.  But I do want to commend the staff at the Dome.  They went out of their way to help.  At half time they located other seats that did not require me doing steps and the seat were almost comparable to our original ones.  I cannot say enough about the wonder staff and the wonderful fan base.  We were tow of 5 UNC fans surrounded by Orange in our section and they were all great about their loss.  It was a great game and a rocking facility to see a game.The shuttle back to parking was great, only about a 5 minute wait and there were plenty of buses  that ran constantly.  Cost of parking was $15.00."
1191,Date of experience: November 2015,15-Nov-15,ACC,Syracuse,4,Good venue for football,"Views for football get better the higher up you sit. Soda $4, beer $6.50-$7.50. No beer sold after half-time. Men be aware shy bladders are going to have a problem - bathroom has long trough style urinal."
1192,Date of experience: September 2015,9-Oct-15,ACC,Syracuse,5,LSU v. Syracuse Road Trip,"Made this a mini vacation with my adult children.  The dome was nice, tailgating was fun and everybody had a good time.  We came up all the way from the Mississippi Gulf Coast.  Everybody we met was warm and welcoming.  Glad we made the trip."

1194,Date of experience: September 2015,29-Sep-15,ACC,Syracuse,4,"LSU vs. Syracuse at Carrier Dome, Syracuse, NY",Visited Syracuse University and the Carrier Dome for a football game at the end of September 2015.  We were in a RV and through prior discussions with the University's parking department we parked at the SkyTop Parking location about 1 1/2 miles from the Carrier Dome.Getting the RV to the SkyTop Parking location was very easy and then parking the RV was easy with university personnel helping locate where to put the RV.  Transit to and from the game was a snap.  I wish other universities would follow the setup used by Syracuse.The Carrier Dome was a little warm as there is no A/C in the building.  Seats are bleachers so suggested to bring a cushion to sit.  I believe all seats provided good view of the football field.
1195,Date of experience: September 2015,28-Sep-15,ACC,Syracuse,3,LSU in town to visit the 'Cuse,"Visited for the LSU game.  Parking was a bit of a challenge, though we were successful in finding a free spot along the campus perimeter.  Seating has great sight lines anywhere in the dome.  All seating is bleacher (lower level has backs), so suggest a cushion for most patrons.  The outside temp was 68F at kickoff, but the dome is not climate controlled - inside temp was 75F.  Fans were great and concession pricing was ok - though quality was not good."
1196,Date of experience: September 2015,21-Sep-15,ACC,Syracuse,3,Go 'CUSE,"It is always a good time at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, NY. September football game was a little hot inside but is expected. The place is due for a upgrade as it is showing its age. Good times."
1197,Date of experience: September 2015,14-Sep-15,ACC,Syracuse,2,Hotter than Heck!,"We went to the first Syracuse football game of the season and it was excruciatingly hot in the Carrier Dome.  We walked all over campus in the heat on 9/4/15 but I kept thinking...""tonight we'll be in the Carrier Dome and Carrier is an air conditioning company so it will be nice and cool.""  Not so much!  It was stifling hot!  The concourse and bathrooms were even hotter so I didn't want to eat or drink.  I felt bad for band members in their long sleeve hot looking costumes.    For all the money that athletics brings to the school they should treat the players and the fans better.Also the outside of the building has no personality besides the dome.  There are no banners or orange and blue colored lights.  It's very industrial looking.  There isn't a lot of ""schtick"" at the game.  I go to many UF games and there is more to entertain and engage the crowd when there isn't a play on the field.The Orange won the game but I am not a fan of the Carrier Dome."
1198,Date of experience: September 2015,9-Sep-15,ACC,Syracuse,4,Go 'Cuse,"We have been here several times over the past 20 yrs. We have seen concerts, high school football games,  and SU football, lacrosse and basketball games. The stadium is on the older side, but still a great venue (especially for basketball games ). Food is nothing spectacular  (a little over priced, but it's a stadium) ,but good enough. Beer selection is your regular stuff, but they also carry a nice selection of national and local craft stuff. All in all a great spot to see an event and oh yeah GO ORANGE!"
1199,Date of experience: January 2015,30-Aug-15,ACC,Syracuse,5,Best college dome around. Fun for the entire family.,Best college dome in the country. Awesome for both basketball games and football games. Lots of fun for the whole family with a great college atmosphere.
1200,Date of experience: January 2015,31-May-15,ACC,Syracuse,4,We've enjoyed coming and watching syracuse Orangemen Basketball games once a year lately,"We've lately been coming to the place primarily for watching Syracuse Basketball games lately. We've come a couple of times in the past to see couple of football games but the vast majority of the time we've come for Syracuse basketball games. Lately we've been coming to see Syracuse Basketball games here at the Carrier Dome pretty much on the average once a year pretty much lately. We ended up coming once this past season to see Syracuse play Florida State Seminoles early this past January, soon after the Holiday's. We've definitely lately enjoyed coming to watch Syracuse Basketball games once a year for the most part! It's definitely for sure interesting to be here and also enjoy watching the marching bands they got perform as well! We've pretty much been coming to watch Syracuse Basketball games here at the Carrier Dome once a year ever since the 1999-2000 basketball season so that pretty much all means the past sixteen year's now. We shall continue to be back to see more Syracuse Orangemen Basketball games that will eventually be coming up, and will try to have that all include one of the games next season the best we can. I am sure you will be seeing me and company coming around again some point for sure eventually. Until then take it easy everyone."
1219,Date of experience: November 2014,11-Jan-15,ACC,Syracuse,3,Getting old and run down,Visited for a college football game in Nov. It is obvious the facility is getting old and it needs a lot of work. Food and drinks were higher then we are accustomed to at other college facilities. I was warned well in advance that parking would be a problem. There really are very few places to park close to the facility and those that are charge $20 or more. Luckily I learned that the VA Hospital literally right across the street from the Dome has a 7 story parking garage that can be used for free if you have a Military ID card - which I happen to have. It took no more than 3 minutes after the game to get back to our car. Others in our traveling party talked about 15-20 minutes to get back to their cars. The staff in the Dome were quite friendly but we can't say the same for the Syracuse University students. The ones we ran into were rude & obnoxious.
1220,Date of experience: December 2014,6-Jan-15,ACC,Syracuse,5,Loved It!,"visited for a basketball game. It was wonderful. Be sure to take your camera as there are many good places to take nice photographs. Be careful when finding your seats. Some rows continue in both directions when you go down the steps. Very different than any other stadium that we have been too. At any rate, you will not be disappointed with your visit.On your way to the Dome you will find many parking garages.  The cheapest one we saw was $10. The prices go up close the closer you get. I suggest the $10 spot if it is not frigid cold out. This was right across from a $20 parking garage."

1222,Date of experience: October 2014,24-Dec-14,ACC,Syracuse,4,Excellent venue to experience sports,This venue is both impressive and a bit awe for this size city. Food was typical. Atmosphere was excellent. Excitement is seen everywhere. Important is security. Security was present everywhere we looked. Even entering the facility. Traffic contro was also impressive. Definitely a great experience for sports.
1224,Date of experience: October 2014,3-Dec-14,ACC,Syracuse,3,expensive average,We were there for a conference....way over-priced food! the food was average stadium food...nothing great. I think they could used a bit of a cut on their prices...give the working class a break!
1225,Date of experience: November 2014,2-Dec-14,ACC,Syracuse,2,Leaves a lot to be desired,"Too big, too old, lousy parking and lousy seats!  Would not recommend for any big events that are held here.  Location is terrible too.  Most everything about the place needs to be rethought"
1230,Date of experience: December 2013,6-Nov-14,ACC,Syracuse,4,They play football and basketball here,"A good atmosphere for big Syracuse basketball games, despite using half of the stadium's space. When the game gets going, you hardly notice that you're in a stadium instead of an arena. Never been to a football game there so I can't comment on that."
1231,Date of experience: November 2021,16-Nov-21,ACC,Virginia,5,UVA Football,Stadium has new updates -- and  some new technology like light show  etc..  Typical metal benches -- lots of strategically placed food booths --not hard to access on foot --parking not great -but we were able to get an uber to come after the game about 1/2 mile outside the stadium after a big game
1233,Date of experience: November 2019,28-Oct-20,ACC,Virginia,5,ALWAYS A WINNER,UVA has an incredible sports culture and Scott Stadium was a big part of that. Great location on Grounds with lots of parking.
1234,Date of experience: September 2019,13-Feb-20,ACC,Virginia,5,Box Seats - Best way to View,"Had an awesome time in Box Seats. Amazing being with alumni and I didn't evengo to UVA - went to another Va. University.Was there with daughter and her father and meeting everyone, eating great food, enjoying the gamewas the best of the best. Would only go again if could get there earlier and park to enjoy tailgating!Game was awesome and of course, WaaHoos WON!"
1235,Date of experience: November 2019,30-Nov-19,ACC,Virginia,1,UVA VT Game - Beware VERY POOR UVA Logistics,Good grief!  You would think over time UVA would have a better handle on managing the logistics for a big game at Scott Stadium.  They were enormously poor!  It was apparent as they intermittently shut off entry points at their gates causing fans to re-route to another gate.  I have never seen such poor management.  And you can??t blame event contractors for this.  This has been a mess for some time.  Which means there have been NO LESSONS LEARNED from any prior experiences.  What also should be of concern is routing large numbers OUT of there were ever such an emergency.  I have no confidence that they can manage this.  They even had uniformed police assisting since the crowds were getting so angry about waiting in a line only to have parties split as they closed gates.  I saw one young son inside the barricade and the supervisors deny admission to the father as they just cut off anyone else from entering that line.  Seriously?  They told him to use a different gate.  While his son stood worried inside the line.  Poor poor poor.  No excuse.
1236,Date of experience: October 2019,5-Nov-19,ACC,Virginia,5,Great football venue,"We live in Charlottesville, are big UVA fans, and go to all home football and basketball games.  Scott Stadium seats about 63K, as I recall.  It??s always clean and welcoming.  We rent seat backs for the season, which make for very comfortable seating.  The seats themselves have no backs and are aluminum.  Bathrooms are satisfactory.  Concessions are good."
1237,Date of experience: September 2019,3-Oct-19,ACC,Virginia,4,Fun place to see a game,"Went for the game against ODU. ODU put up a good fight and made it a good game. Fans were friendly. It's no Boone Pickens/Lewis Field, but we all had a good time. Concession options could be better though"
1238,Date of experience: September 2019,22-Sep-19,ACC,Virginia,5,It was fun!,"Surprising to me, the stadium dates to 1888.  I knew about the VPI rivalry, but didn??t have any clue about the UNC rivalry.  The stadium has plenty of seats and the parking problem is grossly overstated.  Tonight??s matchup was against my Alma Mater, huge underdogs, (weaker and slower), but ODU put up a good fight. Given that I had 2 different long term relationships with people that graduated from UVA (1985,1989), I was embarrassed when I couldn??t find my way around campus.  At the stadium, I was fortunate enough to sit next to a group of very friendly people and we had a great time analyzing almost every single coaching call.  Football games are always fun!!"
1239,Date of experience: September 2019,16-Sep-19,ACC,Virginia,5,Good environment,Traveled with family to see a football game my Seminoles came up short but we had a good time. The fans in our section was very nice even with me cheering for my team as we scored or any big play. Nice stadium and the concessions stands are awesome as far as the prices very reasonableness d that means a lot for families!
1240,Date of experience: October 2018,17-Jan-19,ACC,Virginia,5,UVA against VT season 2018,"College adventure great fun for empty nesters too. Students were respectfully, well behaved. President of UVA greated athletes and visitors. Great Spectical for all"
1241,Date of experience: November 2018,13-Nov-18,ACC,Virginia,4,Scott is Clean and Comfortable,"Stadiums are, by nature, utilitarian.  But Scott Stadium mitigates this feeling by providing a plethora of food options, including everything from Pappa Johns Pizza and Chick-fil-A sandwiches to Bojangles Chicken and everything in between.  The restrooms are clean and warm ( a true relief in cold weather), too.  The two downsides are security (which apparently can be inconsistent in enforcing rules and also slow - leading to long entry lines at key times) and congestion.  During games, the lower level concourse can become extremely crowded as fans try to access food options.  Long waits in these lines will cause fans to miss significant chunks of the entertainment in progress, but some of this can be avoided by heading up to the upper level concessions, which tend to be less busy (although not always.)"
1242,Date of experience: October 2018,3-Nov-18,ACC,Virginia,5,UVA Football game,"We took the family to watch a UVA football game.  The staff was very helpful.  The seats were really good.  The fans were so nice, I would say one of the best football experiences we have had."
1243,Date of experience: October 2018,27-Oct-18,ACC,Virginia,4,Nice football venue,"Bought tickets to the UVA/UNC game on a whim, while in town for Shenandoah NP.  So glad we did.  Parking is great at the UVA bookstore (about .5 mile walk to Scott Stadium).  Stadium has good gameday food.  Recommend getting at least rental seats - as it all appears to be flat bleacher seating - it's well worth the $15 for 2 rental seats.  Good gameday crowd and loved the entrance with the Cavalier astride the horse."
1244,Date of experience: September 2018,30-Sep-18,ACC,Virginia,2,Reduced attention on the fans over the years,"We went for a home game. The security was smooth but likely outnumbered the crowd.  Buses interrupt pedestrian traffic and crosswalks which is kind of a pain. Clear bag policy is claimed for security in a pc world but a general pain in the rear and a cost to the consumer. They should be mailing these out free with every ticket purchase.Overall, it appears someone is sitting in an office making decisions that do not align with fan enjoyment. It is definitely time for a change in management.We have sat on the hill for over 35 years now and this year??s setup was another disappointing change. There was a big Bojangles trailer at the top of the hill. Honestly, the beautiful hill and colonnaded view was ruined by this cheap commercialization. Shame on whoever let this happen. You should be fired publicly and leave in shame.There were also added tents and decks added on either side of scoreboard. They were less than 5% occupied and marred the view from above and below. Another failed attempt to upgrade. Theses amenities should be for everyone to make them worthwhile. Maybe they should be fancy hotdog stands instead. As a business decision, they probably lost more money on staff and tent than revenue of users.The stadium stopped showing the good ole song on the upper level displays and only shows the lyrics on the big board. Reduced fun to please sponsors? Another fail. Thank goodness they brought back the Cavman videos. Spend some money on fan experience.Generally, over the years, fan experience has been diminished  - ticket prices, point systems, sponsors over fans - in addition to poor coach hires leading to the downfall of the football - has led to poor attendance. Putting a Bojangles trailer on the hill is near the top of idiocy that falls into this strategy year after year. It also seems UVA believes more in a high school marching band than winning or enjoyment by the fans. Who goes to the game for the band? Band parents?Bring back the Pep Band and enhance fan experience. They honestly want me to donate more money to the athletic foundation with this experience?"
1245,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Sep-18,ACC,Virginia,3,NOT ORGANIZED WITH WEATHER DELAY,Attended the UVA vs University of Richmond football game on 9/1/18 and received a weather delay email at 5:24pm. Ok so gates were closed and we were advised to seek shelter. Game time was set for 6pm but we were still tailgating and were about 1/2 mile from stadium and still tailgating. My complaint is we were not notified of gates reopening and game time start set at 6:40pm. We on our own decided to walk up and lines were unreal to get in which I understand but game had already started. I love this stadium and the experience but tonight was not the norm. I also took screen shot of the email and it will not let me post it here.
1247,Date of experience: November 2017,26-Nov-17,ACC,Virginia,3,Perfectly typical stadium,"Yes, you'll find bright lights and bench seating and overpriced food and loos. You won't find a football team that you can depend on . . . except to underwhelm."
1248,Date of experience: November 2017,25-Nov-17,ACC,Virginia,5,"Well Designed, Great Venue","First, I am not a Hoos Alum. (try Terps!).  I attended my first game at Scott recently and was impressed by a number of features.  I entered thru the gate away from the parking areas, and had only a few people in front of me.  At the other entrance there was a long line to get thru security.  There are several lines for people with no bags, making entry more convenient.  The public enters thru magnetometers, eliminating the need for lengthy wanding.  The stadium appears to be below grade level, possibly knocking down wind and cold.  The concourse was wider than I am used to, but did get crowded during breaks.  However, hot chocolate was plentiful and went for just $3.00.  Water bottles were $4.00 and beer is not available (fill up at the Corner).  The stadium is an easy walk from the area known as the Corner, with its many restaurants and watering holes.  I was able to find free parking near John Paul Jones arena, a 15 minute walk to the stadium.Seating inside the stadium was on aluminum benches, so our seat cushions came in handy.  Seat cushions were permitted, and a UVA athletic website clearly listed acceptable and unacceptable items.Views of the field seemed to be good from many different sections, as I believe the stadium is somewhat smaller than Byrd Stadium at the Univ. of Maryland.  The scoreboard and sound system were superior.  Even though there is only one scoreboard, people behind it can see basic statistics.  I was so impressed with the scoreboard screen and announcer, and made the one at Univ. of Maryland seem ""Mickey Mouse.""I give Scott Stadium kudos for having some free parking available, being close to eateries at the Corner, having excellent quantity and quality of restrooms, and being a sensible place to watch a ball game."
1249,Date of experience: November 2017,25-Nov-17,ACC,Virginia,4,Very Nice College Stadium,"Have attended a number of games here, including this year's Virginia Tech - UVA game.  The stadium is very picturesque. Staff is okay, but not overly friendly.  The site lines form the upper deck and pretty good."
1250,Date of experience: November 2017,5-Nov-17,ACC,Virginia,2,UVA-GaTech football game,"If you go, make sure not to take an umbrella or a purse bigger than a few square inches. Any bags should be see-through.  They will be checked.  My wife made the mistake of bringing a handbag no more than six inches long and had to throw it in the trash can after having to put everything into a clear bag they gave us.  Luckily, we didn't bring umbrellas, even though it rained on us nearly the whole time we were there, because they would have had to been thrown away too. They said we could take the purse back to the car. But, the closest free parking is at University Hall at least a 20 minute walk up and down hills as all the stadium parking is reserved and other ""charity"" locations were asking $20 to park.  They could learn a few lessons from Disney World about how to treat visitors and get them into the stadium with the least amount of imposition while still checking bags for safety."
1251,Date of experience: October 2017,9-Oct-17,ACC,Virginia,4,"An Awesome Day, Great Family Time","My wife and I were able to gather the entire family for the UVA-Duke football game.  This game was the first with a new entry policy to get into the stadium. It was a little slow for those with bags but our crew had no bags so buzzed through the gates. Bathrooms were clean.  The ushers moved us quickly to our seats once we identified our section.  A beautiful sunny day, a victory for the Hoos and an overall great stadium experience."
1253,Date of experience: September 2016,15-Apr-17,ACC,Virginia,4,"Nice Stadium, No Beer Selling","I understand now that it's an NCAA rule not to sell alcohol in the stadium, but it's not as if people aren't already drinking.  I just wish I could have had a cold beer at the game. However, the stadium is quite nice with a large lawn area at one endzone where the students seem to gather. I was for the opposing team and had a great experience. The UVA fans were kind and sportsmanlike and we had a great time at the game.There are great views pretty much no matter where you sit."
1254,Date of experience: September 2016,19-Feb-17,ACC,Virginia,3,Nice stadium; bad staff,"Scott Stadium is a good place to watch a football game and can be intimidating if UVA is having a good season.  Any seat on the lower deck is pretty good, but the upper deck is pretty far from the action.  The stadium staff can be pretty rude if they want to enforce a particular rule."
1255,Date of experience: October 2016,22-Dec-16,ACC,Virginia,4,Awesome Game Day,I have attended games here twice now and this second time we had much better seats (and weather conditions) and it was just a great afternoon. Really enjoy seeing a game here and how accessible the venue is
1256,Date of experience: November 2016,15-Nov-16,ACC,Virginia,4,Football and Fall make for a perfect weekend,"Attended the Miami?UVA game. Stadium is easy to negotiate, plenty of food offerings - no beer however - and lots of room on the adjacent parking lots for picnics and tailgating. Pets are allowed in the parking lots but not the stadium. Great game viewing from every vantage point."
1257,Date of experience: October 2016,18-Oct-16,ACC,Virginia,4,The football stadium at UVA,"Where you go to watch UVA play football. The only down side is the difficulty in parking. Most people have to park up to a mile away and the walk to the stadium can be a hot, sweaty endeavor during the early fall football season."
1258,Date of experience: September 2016,26-Sep-16,ACC,Virginia,5,Great atmosphere - but so hot,"I've been here now 3 times for college football games: against BYU, Virginia Tech, and CMU. The venue is 86 years old and here and there it shows. The benches are not really comfortable, and it can become blisteringly hot in this stadium, but it's all well worth it. Throughly enjoyed the passionate yet well behaved crowds (a stark contrasts with the European soccer crowds I'm used to).Tip:- Don't fall for the signs ""parking here"" on game days. You'll be charged from $10 up to $50, which is not at all necessary. There plenty of parking in the neighboring areas, you'll just have to look for it."
1259,Date of experience: September 2016,5-Sep-16,ACC,Virginia,4,Football,"Came for a home game.  First time visitor.  Clean bathrooms and stadium.  Not a bad walk in. Even with tons of people, facility was well taken care of"
1261,Date of experience: September 2015,14-Jul-16,ACC,Virginia,5,An amazing place! Wahoowa!,"Go over and stand at the top of the hill for a while (or sit on the hill) for a great vantage on the activity.  People who are UVa fans like me love football but most of us don't get nuts about young men playing a game like folks in some other college towns.  With that said, things could get a bit more rowdy here in the next 10 years on certain fall Saturdays.I have great memories with my family at Scott Stadium.  It is a beautiful structure.  There have been some great games here over the years.  The stadium has a great architectural character, unlike many venues.  A horse rides in through a tunnel before games with the Cavalier riding and swirling his saber.  It is a fun scene.In the last several years, I have felt compelled to leave a few games early to stroll around grounds and get a cup of coffee.  I didn't like some of what I was seeing on the field.  Times are changing, though, regarding college football, in Charlottesville.  I also saw U2 perform at Scott Stadium, and that was a good show."
1262,Date of experience: November 2015,1-Jul-16,ACC,Virginia,4,My ashes will be buried there ... if they can find a place to park!,"I've seen a lot of football games at Scott Stadium.  It's a beautiful place from within.  But first you have to get there.  if you donate enough money to the athletic foundation, you have a good chance.  If not, you may be in for a hike.  Even so, that does not deter most of us.  Jefferson did not consider football or parking in 1819.  So the University is not perfect.  But it is what it is.  Food selection is limited, and not always at the preferred temperature.  Drink selection is likewise limited.  There are of course limits to what objects you can take into the stadium.  No umbrellas, for example.  And yes, it does sometimes rain on Mr. Jefferson's University ... and his football team.  But you will meet some very nice people. Not to mention the helpful and cheerful attendants.  Everybody waits until the last second to arrive and try to crowd thru the gates, it sometimes seems.  So arrive a bit early.  Besides, you don't yet know how long it will take to walk from your parking venue to the stadium.  And I'll not tell you my favorites!  ;-)  See a game.  Come back again."
1263,Date of experience: November 2015,22-Jun-16,ACC,Virginia,5,Great Stadium!,"This place is full of spirit on game days. This is a fun football town because of the fans and the environment. You will see lots of orange and blue and tailgating festivities including the all-time favorite-- corn hole. Go Hoos! Go Cavaliers! If you can see a game here, or a movie, I highly recommend it!"
1264,Date of experience: September 2015,26-Apr-16,ACC,Virginia,4,Football!!!,"Easy to find your seats, helpful event staff, and expensive food like you would expect. You want to make sure you are early b/c you never know how long it will take to get in and get comfortable and you DO NOT want to miss the opening where the horse and rider come out and all the players rush out with the smoke and cannon! The kids love it. Halftime is great when they aren't promoting some group for too long. They finally got a marching band and it is a GREAT addition to Scott Stadium."
1266,Date of experience: December 2015,8-Dec-15,ACC,Virginia,3,Welcome to The Library,"I've been referring to Scott Stadium derisively as The Library for years now. It is among the quietest stadiums of any Power 5 schools. Even back in 2011, when UVa was playing VT for the Coastal Division, the place was very subdued. You can easily carry on a conversation without raising your voice at all.Outside of the fan environment, Scott Stadium is gorgeous.The pergola adds a classy touch. The hill provides a GA area where you can hang out. There are plenty of concessions throughout the stadium.I've sat basically everywhere in Scott Stadium over the past 15 years. There really aren't any terrible seats but like most football stadiums you can have bad perspective on the plays depending on where you sit in the stadium.The lines to get in can be quite long despite less than stellar crowds so plan accordingly."
1267,Date of experience: October 2015,23-Nov-15,ACC,Virginia,4,Football!,"Pretty much easy access to inside stadium, Cavaliers play here and on a nice Autumn day it doesn't get better.  They don't allow you to bring in umbrellas or liquids, so be warned."
1268,Date of experience: September 2015,14-Nov-15,ACC,Virginia,3,"Stadium Nice, Parking and Traffic Flow Horrible",For the past 50 years I have attended college football games as a ND fan at more than 30 stadiums all over the US.  The lack of public parking anywhere remotely near the stadium and traffic flow that made no sense with streets blocked off and traffic directed back to the stadium after the game instead of away from it made no sense.  To exacerbate the the situation there is nothing around the stadium.  The traffic snarl both around the stadium and even in the remote parking areas was a mess.  For a relatively small seating capacity it is remarkable how bad the traffic flow is.  Our seats around the 30 yard line were fine with good sight lines and enough sitting room
1269,Date of experience: October 2015,19-Oct-15,ACC,Virginia,5,great venue for a game,The location is easy to get to. available using public transportation. Parking is an issue as it is all reserved. Many great food vendors during games .
1270,Date of experience: September 2015,4-Oct-15,ACC,Virginia,4,Great Venue for Football...Despite UVA's Poor Play,"As a season ticket holder, we really enjoy attending games at Scott Stadium.  The stadium has wonderful architecture and plenty of restrooms and concessions.  When it is not too crowded, we enjoy strolling along the endzone and sitting in the grass.  My only complaint about the stadium is UVA's generally dismal parking.  Unless you are a well-heeled booster, you can expect to walk about a mile, either from Fontaine or University Hall.  Other big colleges at least offer free shuttles, but the only shuttle option at UVA is if you have a handicap placard, you can park near the law school.  Oh, and Landon's football team hasn't been great either."
1271,Date of experience: September 2015,30-Sep-15,ACC,Virginia,4,One of the more beautiful stadiums I've visited,"While it's just a football stadium (housing a not very good - at this time - team), the stadium itself is very striking.  Its architecture reflects that of the university in general and the ideals of its founder, Thomas Jefferson. (Though I still think he'd be a fan of the football from his Alma Mater, William and Mary,)"
1272,Date of experience: September 2015,22-Sep-15,ACC,Virginia,5,Great stadium with awesome staff!,"We attend football games here, regularly as season ticket holders, and find the ticket prices to be fairly reasonable.  The staff and vendors are super nice and professional.  My in-laws were with us, and my mother-in-law requires a walker to get around.  One of the ushers,Tony, was amazing, he stored it for her so she could watch the game without worrying that it would be in the way.  The stadium offers comfortable stadium chair rentals ($7), which prevent you from having to carry in your own, bulky chairs or pads.  You have a great view of the field, anywhere you may sit.  We are usually section 129, across from the Cavalier Marching Band."
1273,Date of experience: September 2015,14-Sep-15,ACC,Virginia,4,Really Enjoyed the Stadium,A very nice stadium to enjoy a football game in. There are a number of different food options that aren't TOO crazy in price. Definitely stop in and see a game if you are in town.
1275,Date of experience: November 2022,10-Nov-22,ACC,Virginia Tech,4,Go Hokies,This remains a nice stadium to watch a football game. Good vendors and friendly folk. It can be pretty busy so arrive with time to spare.
1276,Date of experience: November 2022,7-Nov-22,ACC,Virginia Tech,3,Game day was fun,"I visited for the Ga Tech/Va Tech game.  Really great pre-game atmosphere with Enter Sandman and a raucous crowd, despite the team not playing well this year.  Fans were overall very polite and didn't give me much grief over wearing Ga Tech gear.  I was a little disappointed with the food options. There was the usual hot dogs/nachos/popcorn, and I saw some people with pizza and bbq sandwiches. But not as much variety as I've seen elsewhere.Physically, the stadium seems to be ageing.  Not many modern amenities to be found."
1277,Date of experience: September 2022,1-Oct-22,ACC,Virginia Tech,4,Great Stadium but Poor post game traffic,Fantastic stadium right on campus which meant getting out the stadium after the game was terrible.    Loved the Sandman entrance.   Was happy that WVU could pull out the win.
1278,Date of experience: October 2021,14-Mar-22,ACC,Virginia Tech,4,Home Game,"If you don't have a paper ticket, take a screen shot of your ticket, the cellphone service get overloaded."
1279,Date of experience: October 2021,1-Nov-21,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Fun Game Day Experience for the Whole Family,"If you are a college football fan, this is a great destination.  I don't even like Va Tech (see my collected works for details) and I had a super time.The atmosphere around the whole town is warm and upbeat.  From local stores, to security staff, to fans, everyone is super friendly.  Going to sporting events can be iffy with drunks and fools. Saw none of that, with great people sitting all around us.Game days at any big school are crowded. So make sure you get a parking pass ahead of time and arrive early.NOTE!  If you want to take in a stadium seat, it has to be soft ONLY with no arms.  No metal in the seat.Enjoy"
1280,Date of experience: October 2021,30-Oct-21,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Great ACC Stadium,Great Stdium right on campus of VA Tech. Get the Turkey Leg on the 1st floor and enjoyed that it now serves beer and hard seltzers.  Great place to watch a game and great entrance by Va Tech. Va Tech fans are very nice to their opponents as long as they are rooting for Virginia
1281,Date of experience: September 2021,27-Sep-21,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,HOKIES!!!!,The only place to watch the HOKIES live! Friendly staff and fun atmosphere . You have to take part in Enter Sandman! Best college experience !
1282,Date of experience: September 2021,27-Sep-21,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,GO HOKIES!,They now serve beer and drinks. Only place to go watch the HOKIES! Sit in the student section to REALLY enjoy the game. Lots of people will help you there if you can't find anything or just need help.
1283,Date of experience: November 2019,6-Dec-19,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE LANE,"Great atmosphere here like no other. Fun place to watch football, staff is wonderful and fans are great!!!"
1284,Date of experience: November 2019,11-Nov-19,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Great Environment,First time back in approximately 8 years and first time with a 4 year old. Just as good as I remember it. Had no problem getting a parking spot in the Prices Fork public lot and my 4 year old had a great time at the pregame festivities.
1285,Date of experience: October 2019,31-Oct-19,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Best Game Opening in College Football,"You MUST get to the stadium early for Enter Sandman. I have been to 10+ college football stadiums and 5+ Pro.  Lane Stadium, packed and jumping is the most electrifying event ever!"
1286,Date of experience: October 2019,24-Oct-19,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Sparkling energy,"Whether you go once or every game or every 10 years, VA Tech football in Lane is always an awesome show.  This year, the band is over 400 strong and plays throughout the game providing support to fans and players.  A military flyover starts the game.  Members of the Corps of Cadets cheer standing during most playing minutes.  And then there??s the Hokie bird mascot.  And massive tasty turkey legs.  Take a walk around the entire stadium on the main level and enjoy what it means to be in Lane."
1287,Date of experience: November 2018,9-Oct-19,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Great venue,"Great atmosphere for exciting football. Food is typical game food. Turkey legs, barbecue, and kettle corn are highlights."
1288,Date of experience: September 2019,14-Sep-19,ACC,Virginia Tech,4,Great Stadium but needs WiFi,"I've been going to this stadium for over 35 years  It's a great setting.The rituals are energizing and exciting.There are lots of bathrooms.Food is typical for a football stadium.  We're probably the only stadium that offers turkey legs.  They're big.  Haven't tried one.The milkshakes from the Dairy School are awesome!!If you don't have a parking pass, you will have to walk a good distance to get from public parking to the stadium.The seat back chairs they use in the stadium (for rent) are not very comfortable.  They kind of push you forward.The one negative item that keeps this place from being excellent is the lack of wifi.  It's nearly impossible to send a text, post a picture on FB, etc.  As a technology school, this is a bit embarrassing."
1290,Date of experience: October 2018,1-Jul-19,ACC,Virginia Tech,4,Notre Dame vs V tech,"I'm a big Notre dame fan , visited Lane Stadium one of the best experiences I've had for an away game.  The fans people were great. Had a wonderful time tailgating, enjoying campus  and oh the V Tech entrance to Enter Sandman one of the neatest heart pounding , entrances in all Of College Football period.It got me pumped just enjoying,  even Though I bleed blue and gold.Wonderful campus, stadium,  fans. A must stio for a college football Saturday period."
1292,Date of experience: November 2018,19-Jun-19,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Hokies,"One of the best places to see a college football game, unbelievable fan support for a small little Virginia town, go Hokies"
1293,Date of experience: September 2018,19-Mar-19,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Football,Best Stadium as well as football team. I don't think I've ever been to such an amazing Stadium with so many things going on to keep you entertained good food a lot of friendly people and of course amazing football. The stadium is very special to me and my family and we are always looking forward to going to games at Lane Stadium! If you've never been you're in for a real treat it would be in your best interest to give it a try sometime you won't regret it.
1294,Date of experience: November 2018,20-Jan-19,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Great gamed day atmosphere,"I've always loved college football. Went here for the Boston College game (wife is a BC  alumnae) and as a neutral fan I had a great time. The fans were all welcoming, the band was entertaining and the Hokies and Eagles put on a heck of a game. Walking around seeing all the tailgating and other festivities made me miss my college days. I would definitely go back. We did have a bit of an issue getting into the right side of the stadium so that might be something you research a little before going. Game day parking is atrocious, but that can be expected. A lot of students rent out spaces in their yards within walking distance to the stadium for $20-$30. They may have official game day parking on campus with shuttles, but again, do some research."
1295,Date of experience: December 2018,23-Dec-18,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Virginia Tech's Football Stadium,This is the home stadium of my alma mater. Many good times were had here as a fan and a member of the Virginia Tech Marching Virginians.  What else can I say?
1296,Date of experience: December 2018,3-Dec-18,ACC,Virginia Tech,3,Beautiful stadium,It??s pretty place to watch a football game. But it??s a steep climb. The chair backs they rent lean you forward. Very little room between rows. That??s why you constantly are trying to balance yourself. Plenty of restrooms and wide range of food options. But get used to very cramped quarters.
1297,Date of experience: November 2018,19-Nov-18,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Tech game And Enter Sandman = Bucket list,"Had the pleasure to see a Tech football game here and experience the entire Hokie atmosphere including jumping to Enter Sandman, rattling keys at key play, eating turkey leg and many wonderful Hokies.Clearly recommended"
1299,Date of experience: October 2018,6-Nov-18,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Virginia Tech vs. Notre Dame 2018,"This is a great place to catch a college football game on a Saturday night.  The crowd was bonkers, great atmosphere.  Everyone was friendly, di not run into any undesirables."
1300,Date of experience: October 2018,27-Oct-18,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,"One of the best traditions, Enter Sandman!","Although we are ND fans, we really enjoyed the Enter Sandman tradition. The stadium was rocking! The fans were great as we walked around the stadium and campus before the game. The campus was very nice with old buildings and monuments. We felt welcome and no one was unkind or rude."
1301,Date of experience: September 2018,26-Oct-18,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Great atmosphere for football,"Being Virginia Tech alums we always enjoy returning to watch a football game in a really great atmosphere, especially if the weather is good.  Go Hokies!"
1302,Date of experience: October 2018,14-Oct-18,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,"Virginia Tech, Notre Dame","Wonderful place to watch sporting events.  Even if the game does not turn out your way, the atmospher is in the one of a kind category."
1303,Date of experience: October 2018,10-Oct-18,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Unbelievable College Football Atmosphere,"I've had season tickets since 1980 and the game day experience just keeps getting better.  Last weekend we hosted a couple of Notre Dame fans who have been to games all over the country.  They were totally blown away by the experience.  Enter Sandman even included a message from Metallica and there were also skydivers and fireworks.Unfortunately, the Hokies lost the game but the overall experience was amazing.Attending a game at Lane Stadium ought to be on every college football fan's bucket list."
1304,Date of experience: October 2018,8-Oct-18,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,"Enter Night, Exit Light.","Ioved the maroon effect. Tailgating was half of the fun! Though I was a little upset with the Notre dame game, because we had lost, and we had seats in 510-501, and that was the visiting team section. Do not sit there! There were some great performances from the dance team, highty tightys, the marching virginians, and an extraordinary skydiving performance. We also got to see the rec sports center named Beamer-Watson, and we saw coach Beamer receive an award."
1305,Date of experience: October 2018,6-Oct-18,ACC,Virginia Tech,4,Great place for football!,"Just left the stadium, a little disappointed, Notre Dame put it on our Hokies.The stadium is a great place with plenty of seating and concessions to make a visit memorable. That busses from the parking areas were excellent, little wait and quick transit to the game."
1306,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Oct-18,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,VT Football Stadium,Great atmosphere for Hokies and visitors.  The Marching Virginians and the Highty Tighties add wonderful pregame and halftime shows.  The team is energetic but respectful and well coached
1307,Date of experience: September 2018,26-Sep-18,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Start Jumping!!!,"There is no place on earth like Lane Stadium at a Hokies home game.  Absolutely nothing.The atmosphere is electric, the spirit is uplifting, and the volume can be overwhelming as you enjoy football with 62,323 of your closest friends.Amenities abound- milkshakes from the Dairy Club booth, all the standard football game fare, and uniquely, turkey legs!There are plenty of women's bathrooms- kept in good repair.  This is not the case in all football venues.Whether you're in the upper stands, or in premium seating, Lane Stadium is home for Hokies, and those who wish they were."
1308,Date of experience: September 2018,15-Sep-18,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,"Exit Light, Enter Night!",By far the best atmosphere I have experienced for college football. Hokie fans are engaged and loud the whole game. There??s nothing like experiencing Enter Sandman!  Facilities are always clean and there are plenty of concessions available. Go Hokies!
1309,Date of experience: October 2017,21-Aug-18,ACC,Virginia Tech,4,Good ACC football venue,"Lane is one of the best football venues in the ACC and SEC, particularly at night and when leaves are changing.  The crowd is into the game just before kickoff, and I can understand why visiting teams don't want to play there.  VT heavily rewards the season ticket holder with good parking and seats like all schools.  Get there early, be prepared to walk a good distance, and bring binoculars if you sit near or in the endzones."
1310,Date of experience: September 2017,9-Jul-18,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,College football spirit,"The VT students, staff and alumni make your college football experience the best!!  So much school spirit you will want to become a hokie fan."
1311,Date of experience: November 2017,9-Jul-18,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Best college football stadium,Lane stadium is amazing. You can feel the electricity as soon as you enter the stadium. As soon as Enter Sandman plays the place emits seismic vibrations from everyone jumping up and down. Love spending game day in Lane stadium. Go Hokies.
1312,Date of experience: November 2017,4-Jun-18,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Start Jumping!!!,"Watching the Hokies play at Lane Stadium is ALWAYS a good time!  The fans love their Hokies like no fanbase I've ever seen before.  They are up jumping, screaming, and shaking keys the entire time.  If you are in the area, you have to go witness Enter Sandman and the Hokies!"
1315,Date of experience: September 2017,3-Mar-18,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Football Game,"Watching the Hokies play at Lane Stadium is ALWAYS a fun event!!!!!! Absolutely a ton of excitement, fans jumping, keys shaking, and the canon firing! It??s a must do when you??re in the area!!!"
1316,Date of experience: September 2017,19-Feb-18,ACC,Virginia Tech,4,Go Hokies!,No better place to enjoy a college football game than on the gridiron of Lane Stadium!  The place literally rocks when the fans get going!
1317,Date of experience: October 2017,24-Jan-18,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Lane Stadium is one of the best stadiums and college football atmospheres around,"The way the stadium is shaped allows for the Hokie nation to rock and roll on game day, especially on third downs of the opposing team, while concessions, restrooms, and memorabilia are located in easy to access locations around the stadium. The Hokie Vision large screen display has a great picture visible from almost any seat while the speaker system allows for loud but understandable audio. Grab a grilled turkey leg, a coke, and a sweatshirt and get back to the game!"
1318,Date of experience: January 2017,3-Dec-17,ACC,Virginia Tech,4,Fun tailgating,I went to two football games in 91 and again in 94.  Both games were fun experiences.  We were really close to the stadium for tailgating.  I have been told we must have had golden Hokies tickets.
1319,Date of experience: November 2017,25-Nov-17,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,The Best College Football Experience,"What an amazing venue to watch a football game in. With over 70,000 students, fans, and Cadets, Lane Stadium is one of the BEST venues. Enter the Sandman is a must see for any fan of the game. It??s crazy!!!"
1320,Date of experience: November 2017,20-Nov-17,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Enter Sandman,Top 5 college football venue.  Go Hokies.  Be ready to stand the entire game or please stay away!  Night games are the best.
1321,Date of experience: September 2017,10-Nov-17,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Great venue for football game,"Came to Lane for a Hokie game in Sept 2017.  Fantastic atmosphere, the intro for the team is amazing, rocks the surrounding area.  Definitely a scene every college football fan has to experience."
1322,Date of experience: October 2017,9-Nov-17,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,VT/Duke Game,"Beautiful Stadium! Everything was nice and clean, even the bathrooms. We enjoyed the Game! Everyone was very nice and the HOKIES won!"
1323,Date of experience: October 2017,5-Nov-17,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Nice stadium - even in the rain,"We had great seats for the Virginia Tech - Duke game, but I noticed that most of the seats have a good view as well. We stayed until the 3rd quarter, when it started pouring rain. A lot of people stayed and a lot were watching the TV under the stands to stay dry. The field held up pretty well to all the rain and it was entertaining to see the tackled players slide across the field like a slip and slide. A great game experience despite all the rain."
1324,Date of experience: October 2017,2-Nov-17,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Spirited Football Venue,Hokie fans are the best.  The stadium is always packed and full of excitement.  Get there early for the team entrance tradition of fans jumping to Enter Sandman.  Read up on the clear bag rules.
1325,Date of experience: October 2017,24-Oct-17,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,You will be a Hokie Fan,"Or at least a fan of the Hokie fans, when you experience a game here.  So many traditions and routines.  It is really one of the best community experiences you could be part of."
1326,Date of experience: October 2017,24-Oct-17,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Must Experience a Football Game at Lane!,"I was worried about how high our seats were, based on row numbers, but I think there must not be a bad seat in the whole stadium!  The atmosphere is unbelievable, Virginia Tech's team spirit is like no other!  Entry was quick and easy, no lines. We were greeted by polite, friendly GERMAN club members who were handing out programs.  Seats were easy to find, and ushers were eager to help. Bathrooms were clean and plentiful."
1327,Date of experience: October 2017,23-Oct-17,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Homecoming 2017,"Sellout crowd, great atmosphere and lots of fun.  Greatest place to watch a college football game in October."
1329,Date of experience: September 2017,2-Oct-17,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,This is Home,No place I would rather be.  So many memories; a true cathedral of college football.  There is not a better atmosphere in the country.
1330,Date of experience: September 2017,27-Sep-17,ACC,Virginia Tech,4,Football on Saturday,"My first visit to Lane and VT football. A review of game day at VT. Parking is far away and a long walk unless you are a season pass holder and large contributor to the athletic department. So for first timers bring walking shoes. The sun is strong at 2200 foot elevation so sit on the west side or south end zone if attending during the afternoon. If there is a military fly over then the south end zone gives the best view. Some seats allow access to indoor lounges for restrooms, food and alcoholic beverages. Sorry no beer in the stands. College football is a game, show, and experience. A cross between sport and theater. A word about tailgating. For some it is a weekend picnic and for others it means drinking. So be watchful of your surroundings. Lastly if you do not have tickets prior to game day there are always people reselling tickets on the way to the game. So for a fun time bring sunblock, money to buy water and a loud yell to support your team."
1331,Date of experience: September 2017,24-Sep-17,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Love this venue,We were there for the VA Tech football game yesterday. Fun as always. Great turkey legs and kettle corn.

1337,Date of experience: September 2017,2-Sep-17,ACC,Virginia Tech,2,Overrated,"I'm not really into a sport, and when it's empty it's well just a giant empty stadium. I'm sure most others here love participating in lane stadium or even watching others but I just don't see the big deal here."
1338,Date of experience: October 2016,20-Aug-17,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Great atmosphere,"If you have never been to lane stadium do yourself a favor and go. From the food to the tailgating to the amazing entrance to enter sandman , you have to experience this place! Go Hokies!"
1339,Date of experience: November 2016,16-Aug-17,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Home!,"Majestic views of the woods and mountains and skies during the games. Great crowds of knowledgeable fans. Part of the game day experience of pre-parties, the game, then more before a trip to a hotel or a drive home. Win or lose, it is always a fantastic experience."
1342,Date of experience: September 2016,19-Jul-17,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Nothing but FUN,"If you haven't experienced a Hokie game, you're missing out, big time!!  Lots of good food vendors to choose from."
1343,Date of experience: September 2016,10-Jul-17,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Shangri-La!,"An absolutely wonderful place to see a ball game, Lane Stadium is a MUST for any true college football fan. Even if you aren't a VT fan, you can be a Hokie for a day. Plan on tailgating when you come...it's a great way to meet a bunch of friendly new people. I've been lucky enough to visit a handful of college stadiums and they all certainly have their own charm, but you'll find Hokie fans to be among the friendliest in all of college football!"
1344,Date of experience: November 2016,8-Jun-17,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Greatest Stadium,"I may be bias, but you can't get a better college football environment than Lane Stadium. It is always pumped with energy and the Hokies usually provide a great show."

1346,Date of experience: October 2016,17-May-17,ACC,Virginia Tech,4,One of the Best Entrances in College Football,Provides a great atmosphere if the Hokies are winning.  The team's entrance to Enter Sandman is one of the best in college sports.

1348,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Apr-17,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Enter Night,"What better place to visit than Lane Stadium?  During football season, no place rocks like Lane Stadium.  Beware of sitting on the east side if it's hot and sunny.  Beware of sitting on the west side if it's cold and rainy."
1349,Date of experience: September 2016,5-Apr-17,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Good times!,The fan experience here gets 5 stars.  The traditions associated with Hokie football at Lane Stadium are unforgettable.
1350,Date of experience: August 2016,27-Jan-17,ACC,Virginia Tech,3,Enter the Sandman,"What can you say about a football stadium other than, ""It's big."" It's the VT fans that make it truly exciting. However, the seats are very uncomfortable. The sound system is good and the restrooms accessible. Food services are really bad, especially given that VT has the best food services of any campus in the nation. Drinks are expensive too. But, any game there is going to be a great one!"
1351,Date of experience: November 2016,21-Jan-17,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,A Must,If you have never been to a Virginia Tech football game then you have to put it on your bucket list.   Atmosphere is unbelievable and the stadium is beautiful
1352,Date of experience: November 2016,9-Dec-16,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Nothing but 5 stars for our Hokies,"There really is no place like Lane Stadium for a college football game. We have been going to games for years, as my husband played there. However, this was the first time we actually tried walking around the entire stadium to stay warm, during half time. We didn't realize there were so many food options near the SE part of the stadium. You can find BBQ and other food vendors down there. You can actually walk around the entire stadium during the game."
1353,Date of experience: November 2016,1-Dec-16,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,An absolute blast!,I can't think of anything more fun than jumping to Enter Sandman as the Hokies take the field!  Lane Stadium is always  filled with happy energy and smiling faces.  You can't help but have a great time.
1354,Date of experience: November 2016,27-Nov-16,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,As good as it gets in college football,"If you are a fan of college football, then put this place on your list of ""must do"" destinations.  These people are passionate about their team, and the pre-game rituals are as good as they get in sports.  The place really fills up, and seems that they put out a good product on the field, too."
1355,Date of experience: November 2016,22-Nov-16,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,No Better Place to Be!,"Never miss a home game at Lane Stadium.  When Enter Sandman starts the place starts jumping.  Great atmosphere, great football.  Whether you tailgate outside the stadium or hit a bar downtown..an experience you will not soon forget!"
1356,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Nov-16,ACC,Virginia Tech,4,Great Stadium,This stadium is very well maintained. There is a great selection of food options to choose from. Great security and could not ask for a better experience.
1357,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Nov-16,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Lane,"Certainly, there is no other Virginia stadium that rocks and bounces with more electricity when about 65,000 Hokies fans come in to see our foorball team eke out another win. It is well laid out, easy to navigate, and there is no problem getting in and out of seats. You haven't experienced Blacksburg until you've been in Lane Stadium on Virginia Tech game day."
1358,Date of experience: September 2016,3-Nov-16,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Best place ever!!!,"Been a season ticket holder for over 20 years, and just finished getting my second generation Hokie out n 2013!"

1360,Date of experience: September 2016,17-Oct-16,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Great Atmosphere,I've watched a lot of games here.  Night games are electric and great to watch.  Thursday night games are especially loud and fun to attend.
1361,Date of experience: September 2016,16-Oct-16,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Homecoming 2016,"Getting in and out of the stadium, not the parking lot was easy and well organized.  Although they now require a clear bag for anything you take into the stadium (no purses, fanny packs etc.)  they have plastic bags at the entrances that they will give you to put your stuff in.  Really nice!"
1362,Date of experience: September 2016,7-Oct-16,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Worth a Ride,"Went to the VT/BC game last month and had a great time.  Pretty nice stadium for a college team. Hard benches to sit on with no backs, but that is pretty standard in non pro locations.  Had good seats so can't comment on views from up top. Good food choices if you walk around a little, including Buffalo Wild Things. Great video board and crowd excitement It was white effect day and they had V/T tee shirts for $6.00 to make sure white blanketed the stands. Guess overall it was worth the +10 hour drive. Funny thing was the game wasn't a sellout is a small town without much to do."
1363,Date of experience: September 2016,27-Sep-16,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Great Venue,"This was the first visit here in about 10 years and I was impressed with the improvements.  The scoreboard is excellent with great video and probably the best audio I've heard compared to other stadiums.  The facilities are well maintained and very clean.  Good place to enjoy a Tech victory with 65,000 of your good friends"
1364,Date of experience: September 2016,25-Sep-16,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,AMAZING,Until you do it...words cannot describe it! Every person is in their VT wear! ( including babies ) great positive energy!

1371,Date of experience: November 2015,20-May-16,ACC,Virginia Tech,3,Nothing like game day,Fan or not vt spirit is rolling on fall game days. You can't escape burgundy and orange everywhere.  Love third down Hokies bird call and touch down cannon.

1374,Date of experience: November 2015,15-May-16,ACC,Virginia Tech,4,"Clean and nice, but home crowd stands","Came as a visitor, relatives attend VT but we all attended the opposing team's school.The stadium is clean, nice bathrooms and concessions, and jumbotron.  The problem is that the home Hokie fans around us stand for most of the entire game, so we paid so much money for our tickets and we could not see unless we stood.   I get that they shake their keys and sing VT stuff, that is fun to see what the other fans do, but standing is a bit of an issue.Next time I will watch the game on TV, where I can sit down!"
1375,Date of experience: October 2015,6-May-16,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Football!!,There is nothing like attending a football game at Virginia Tech.  Everyone is so friendly and the crowd knows how to cheer on their Hokies.  You can't help getting into the spirit of the game.
1378,Date of experience: November 2015,27-Apr-16,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Virginia Tech Football,"Let's Go Hokies! Lane Stadium is home to the Virginia Tech Hokies Football Team, Enter Sandman, and Frank Beamer for 29 years. Lane is known for being loud - students and fans help keep it that way. There are almost no bad seats in the house with great views even from the upper levels - speaking of which, there are great views of campus and Blacksburg from the top."
1381,Date of experience: September 2015,30-Mar-16,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Quality football environment,Attending a game at Lane Stadium is a quality experience from is opening to end. Night games are special wit outstanding fireworks.
1383,Date of experience: November 2015,21-Feb-16,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Va Tech Football Stadium,The stadium is very nice with small feel in a larger stadium. Views of the field are nice from any seat. Concessions and restrooms were above expectations. Restrooms in South end zone were nicest. Easy access. Attendants were very helpful and friendly. All of the stone work enhances the beauty of the stadium not to mention the surrounding Fall scenes.
1384,Date of experience: November 2015,8-Feb-16,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Football game,Words can't describe the excitement that happens in Lane Stadium! Only the experience of being there!!

If you are a student or fan you must attend a couple games! VT is known for having a great fan base and the always turn up at the games! They have plenty of snack vendors, from the stadium concessions to other vendors, dairy club milkshakes and Buffalo Wild Wings. My husband and I usually get season tickets. We love watching our Hokies play!"
1386,Date of experience: October 2015,15-Dec-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,4,"""Home"" for the Virginia Tech Hokie football team","This is an excellent facility! Frank Beamer's workplace for 29 years! The fans are always enthusiastic, perhaps especially so for night games. But really, always! They could use more bathroom facilities."
1387,Date of experience: November 2015,4-Dec-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Awesome Experience,Have been going to lane for years and this stadium has evolved into one of the finest in the country. It has been expanded and still has that cozy feel. The parking at Tech is some of the worst in the country but making the long walk to lane has become a tradition. I hope the traditions continue with the new coach.
1388,Date of experience: August 2015,23-Nov-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Come for a game OR a function,"Lane is a very energetic place. I have been lucky enough to be in the tunnel and run out with the players, be on the field during epic games, been in the nicest box's like the Merryman's, and Wedding's in the end zone. COOL PLACE!"
1389,Date of experience: November 2015,23-Nov-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,The Best,I've spent almost fifty years of Saturdays here cheering on my beloved Hokies. You can go to bigger stadiums. You can go to newer and fancier staddiums. But... there's no better stadium to experience a football game.
1390,Date of experience: October 2015,11-Nov-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,"Friendliest fans,,wildest team entry .. greatest fans","From the tailgaters to the atmosphere inside the stadium to the game itself, there is no better place to watch a college football game.The team's entry with Enter Sandman by Metalica playing, the students jumping and fireworks popping from behind the South and North stands is cause for goose bumps.The typical fly over and the fans cheering  ""Let's Go""....""Hokies""If you can get a ticket, don't miss it."
1391,Date of experience: November 2014,29-Oct-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,1,too big,"Too big, too self important. They should plow it under and eliminate football from VaTech. Think of all the money they could save and use for actual education..."
1392,Date of experience: October 2015,15-Oct-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,We beat NC State,The game was delayed by lightning and they did not allow anyone in.  They opened the gates and said the game would start in 15 minutes.  I can not believe how efficiently they had 65000 fans seated... most by the kick off.  Great Job.  Let's JUMP!!!
1393,Date of experience: October 2015,15-Oct-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Lane Stadium,"Loud, huge, exciting, heart breaking, cold, hot, wet, worse parking in town. Best place in town to have a good time."
1394,Date of experience: October 2015,10-Oct-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,4,Super football facility,The stadium itself is very nice. Quite large but not a typical oval. North & South end zones are different and make for an attractive stadium. Concourses are very large & wide. A lot of restrooms and they are large & well maintained/cleaned during the game. There are a lot of concession stands with a large mixture of food/drink items. The only down side to the stadium is parking if you do not have access to one of the season ticket holder parking lots. Even these lots can be well over a 1/2 mile walk to the stadium. The closest open to the public lots are actually very close to the stadium but you have to drive thru residential neighborhoods to get to them. They do not belong to the University. A serious problem is getting out of these lots after the game. We literally sat in our car for 45 min without starting it because nobody was moving. Once we finally started it took another 50-60 minutes to get out of Blacksburg - without traffic a 10 min drive.
1395,Date of experience: October 2015,5-Oct-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,4,Amazing footbal statium for a college,First time visit and it could have been better since it Virginia Tech lost and this in poring rain so the Marching Virginian's not was not able to do their half time show.However an amazing stadium and I hope to be back sometime when it is a nice game plus great weather.
1396,Date of experience: October 2015,4-Oct-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,4,VT- Pitt football game,Did not like the outcome of the game but the stadium was great. Did not have to want forever to go to the bathroom at halftime like you do in most stadiums. The concession lines were really long but offered a good variety of food.
1397,Date of experience: September 2015,18-Sep-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,One of the greatest spots in college sports,"The most enthusiastic crowds in college football make the atmosphere electric in this 60,000+ person stadium.  Enter Sandman plays as the fans jump up and down, shaking the very structure of the stadium. Military tradition is displayed as over 1,000 cadets march in with their comrades. And the transition between the third and fourth quarters features the sousaphones of both school bands, and many times the opposing bands, as they play the Hokey Pokey, showing that the team that once featured a turkey as its mascot  (now the Hokie Bird which still has turkey-like features) can still relish in making fun of itself while playing against some of the nation's finest teams."
1398,Date of experience: September 2015,17-Sep-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Still my favorite stadium,"I'm probably biased. I'm a Virginia Tech graduate and I have been going to Lane for over 25 years now. It is a great place to watch a game, especially against a big time opponent like Ohio State on Labor Day.When ""Enter Sandman"" kicks in right as the Hokies take the field, the stadium literally moves. To me, it is a bit a shame that the students have now mostly been relegated to the endzones. (When I was in college there weren't permanent seats in the endzones!) Enclosing the stadium has really amped up the volume in Lane Stadium."
1399,Date of experience: September 2015,15-Sep-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,VA Tech fans are great hosts!,"What a fun time we had cheering on the Ohio State Buckeyes as they played Virginia Tech last weekend! The VA Tech fans were amazing! They were so friendly and welcoming! The ""Enter Sandman"" entrance onto the field by the VA Tech team was an amazing spectacle complete the military cadets, cheerleaders, fireworks and ALL of the VA Tech fans on their feet, cheering their team on. It was so much fun! Can anyone explain the large evergreen trees growing IN the stadium?"
1400,Date of experience: September 2015,13-Sep-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Visiting team,Great venue! Tech fans are polite... If they lose you come across a few sore losers but overall it was a good experience.
1401,Date of experience: September 2015,13-Sep-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Hokie Respect makes visiting team experience memorable,"Had a great time. Just visited for opening day 2015. The stadium itself was relatively new and well maintained.  With capacity of 66k there didn't seem to be a bad seat in the house. Was given a free program which was a nice touch. The food looked interesting with some fair food flare (corndogs, anyone?), but did not try. The video boards were experiencing a lot of technical difficulties, with the major screen often did not have a clear picture. Maybe related to early season technical bugs that need worked out.During game-time, the Enter Sandman entrance is pretty spectacular to witness.  Students seemed engaged the entire game, which was great to see. And the stadium got LOUD. Very impressive, Hokies, for that much sound with 66k. Fans were all friendly, did not have one bad experience despite countless interactions. The backdrop of mountains, and the beautiful campus made this a majestic experience, but the people of V. Tech made this forever memorable.If you are a college football fan, add this to your bucket list. Just try to look past the audible played every 3rd down..."
1402,Date of experience: September 2015,9-Sep-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Beautiful Campus,"Attended Lane Stadium for the Ohio State vs. VaTech game.  The campus is beautiful - and the stadium easily accessible.  Traffic was a nightmare, but that was expected."
1403,Date of experience: September 2015,9-Sep-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,4,"A ""Must-visit"" for the true college football fan","Ok, I admit it.  I'm a college football junkie.   I've enjoyed watching my Buckeyes in 18 stadiums in 15 states.  Literally in all four corners of the country and in between.  All I can say is that Hokie fans just ""get it"".   They are ""all-in"" from pre-game tail-gating through the final snap -  with some pretty awesome traditions in between like their stadium-rocking team entry to Metallica's ""Enter Sandman"".   Hokie fans we encountered throughout our visit from our hotel to the venue and everywhere in between were welcoming and cordial.  With their own clear love of their team and the game, they respect visitors who would travel hundreds of miles to support their own teams and they go out of the way to make a visitor's experience pleasant.   One notable thing I loved (at least from our perspective) is that Hokie fans come to the game to be ""engaged"" in the game.  They don't go there to just text, socialize, eat nachos and make endless and countless trips to the concession stands.  They actually watch the game, know what's going on and become the incredibly loud 12th man.  How very novel and as it should be!!  And I absolutely loved it.  They also didn't bail out and totally empty the stadium when their team clearly had lost the contest.  In a word, TRUE FANS! The only not-so-pleasant issues were the difficulty in finding parking and post-game traffic.  Admittedly, we arrived ""only"" 4-1/2 hours prior to a huge Labor Day night game.  But armed with a parking map and some local advice we still criss-crossed and circled the sprawling campus for well over an hour before resorting to a little elementary school parking lot over a meandering mile away. (It DID save us $$, paying only $8 vs. the $20 in their ""public"" lots which were already all full and closed off). Blacksburg isn't ""flat lands"" so there was a lot of up and downhill walking involved to get to /from the stadium where (unlike many places we've been) there's not a bad seat in the house.  While we were told that post-game traffic is exponentially improved over that of a decade ago by much-needed highway improvements, it took us forever to get out of there and highway speeds never got over bumper-to-bumper 15mph until we were half way to Roanoke.  All in all, counting the 30-minute walk to our parking, the 35 minute trip to our hotel took 2-1/2 hours.    Notwithstanding, it was truly a great experience and one that a true college football fan should put on their bucket list."
1404,Date of experience: November 2014,8-Sep-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,4,University Stadium like most others,"It is a fun stadium, but I don't find it any different than any other university stadium I have been to.  Of course, the atmosphere is created by thousands of adoring fans."
1405,Date of experience: September 2015,8-Sep-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,2,Worst transportation issues ever!! Unsafe at night...dangerous shuttle service to satellite parking!,"Though Lane Stadium and Hokie Nation were great hosts for our night game, the transportation situation is deplorable. The VA Tech official website was no help for game parking. Signage on game day was terrible. We conferred w hotel patrons and found satellite parking. But after the game it was ridiculous and dangerous. We waited over an hour on unlit sidewalks for te shuttle to our car. No police directing traffic and only a single person w radio to assist hundreds of people trying to get shuttle. Masses of people crowded onto an unlit walk....one woman nearly hit by a bus squeezing through traffic. Nearly 2 hours to get to our car. No porta potties or open restrooms in area either. Then traffic jam all the way east to get to I81. We will avoid Lane at all costs....."
1406,Date of experience: November 2014,2-Sep-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,VT vs. UVa,Great time watching VT beat UVA!!! Every seat has a full view of the stadium and makes watching the game even better
1407,Date of experience: September 2015,2-Sep-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,HOKIES,Home Stadium to the HOKIES.  Great game experience.  Tail gating is big and traffic is usual for game day.  A great place to experience a college football game.

1412,Date of experience: August 2014,17-Jun-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Its Great!,Great place to watch football! If only the Hokies were a little better! The crowd is really loud and the fans are great! Definitely a college stadium everyone should go to.
1413,Date of experience: December 2014,3-Jun-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Home games a must,"You can't beat the entrance of the Hokies!  The fans know their football and it is an incredible atmosphere, especially Thursday night games.  The east side gets full sun throughout the game and the west side thru the first quarter on those early games."
1417,Date of experience: November 2014,19-May-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Ultimate Hokie House of Worship,"Watching Hokie football in Lane Stadium is a spiritual experience, from jumping to Enter Sandman, jingling keys on critical 3rd downs, cheering H-O-K-I-E-S Hokies!, dancing to the Hokie Pokey, and watching exciting BeamerBall. A night game is at a whole other level - fireworks and an electric atmosphere. Notes: no alcohol, umbrellas,backpacks, noisemakers allowed. Be prepared to have your bag checked at the gate. Get there early to see the pre-game rituals and Enter Sandman."
1418,Date of experience: September 2014,6-May-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Hokie Football at Lane Stadium  Can't Be Beat!,"There is no better stadium in which to watch the Hokies dominate their opponents! The feeling of being home pervades the place. It's a fantastic stadium with great views of the natural grass gridiron from any seating area.What will you see? Fantastic football, over 60,000 fans, The Highty Tighties, Skipper the world??s largest game cannon and the world famous Hokie Bird. Don't miss your chance to dance! Between the 3rd and 4th quarters, the tuba section of The Marching Virginians lines up to play and dance the Hokie Pokie. Band members will invite tuba players from the Highty Tighties and the visiting band to join them.NCAA ACC Football at its very best!Although I do miss seeing the old ""Home of the Fighting Gobblers"" sign that used to decorate the outside of the stadium. That sign now hangs above the HokieShop in the West Stands concourse."
1419,Date of experience: November 2014,17-Apr-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Great place to watch college football,"We've had season tickets since 1980 and have watched unbelievable growth in size and excitement.  Today, I don't think there's anywhere better to watch college football.  When the first chords of ""Enter Sandman"" hit, you can feel the electricity in the air.  If you love college football, this should be on your ""can't miss"" list."
1420,Date of experience: October 2014,10-Apr-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,4,Electric!  Enter Sandman!,"Great place to watch college football - even better when the Hurricanes beat the Hokies at home!  Truly one of the best college venues for college football and ""Enter Sandman"" is a perennial favorite.  I would give it 5 out of 5 stars if the food selections were better - but then again, it's a college stadium."
1421,Date of experience: November 2014,7-Mar-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Great college football atmphere,"I've had season tickets at Lane Stadium for over 20 years. There have been many improvements in seating, lighting, game day experience, etc. (the rest rooms on the West side could use some upgrades but the constant has been the crowd. There are few places that can rock the way Lane Stadium can at a night game - rain or shine, heat or cold. When Sandman plays...The concession food is actually quite good and varied. From turkey legs, to barbeque to cheese steaks to pizza to burgers and fries I've never had anything that wasn't hot and wasn't good. The crowd is generally welcoming of opposing fans. There is no alcohol served in the stadium but tailgating several hours before the game is a long standing tradition. The students are seated on the east side which might be good to remember if you are bringing children."
1423,Date of experience: January 2015,20-Jan-15,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,This place is huge,This place is huge it really brings that feeling of  glory to you and the great history of the bookies trying to get tickets is a challenge but if you can do and enjoy the atmosphere and tailgate before the game .The atmosphere is great even better with a victory
1424,Date of experience: August 2014,30-Dec-14,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Amazing Atmosphere for College Football!!!!!!!!,"While visiting our son who is a Freshman at VT, we attended the opening football game in August: VT vs. W&M. What a fantastic time we had tailgating before the game: we saw the parade, marching band, Hokie Bird, the VT Football Team and thousands of Fans!! Everyone at the game inside Lane Stadium was friendly and professional! We were fortunate to experience the game inside the owner's suites! I am sure, a different experience: buffet of food, desserts and open bar! Amazing experience! Like the other reviews shared, ""Enter Sandman"" by Metallica was explosive!!"
1425,Date of experience: October 2014,9-Dec-14,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Go Hokies!,"It's a great stadium with an awesome tailgating crowd. The stadium isn't huge, but when ""Enter Sandman"" starts playing, you might think it's gigantic as the crowd goes wild. Great fans and most of the seats are good, especially with the addition of the new scoreboard (added in 2013/14). The fireworks and canon shots are also a nice touch!"
1426,Date of experience: November 2014,2-Dec-14,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,Fun Venue for a Game!,"We attended the VT UVA game this past weekend.  Although it was a cold 23 degrees, everyone was having a great time.  They really know how to get the fans involved and have fun.  It's not as large as an SEC facility, but still quite impressive a stadium.  Good music, fireworks, traditions.  Go VT!"
1427,Date of experience: November 2013,9-Oct-14,ACC,Virginia Tech,5,One of the top college football experiences,Great atmosphere. The team taking the field to Enter Sandman by Metallica is one of those bucket list things to see for hardcore college football fans.
1431,Date of experience: January 2023,12-Jan-23,ACC,California,4,The Football Stadium.  Go Bears!,"It's a landmark as the big stadium for the Bears.  Go Bears!  I am an alumnus and I have some interest in this sports venue.  Gets very busy on a football day, traffic an people."
1432,Date of experience: October 2022,6-Nov-22,ACC,California,4,Get rid of the cannon!,"Other than the cannon that goes off when they score, the stadium was really nice. The shuttle bus was impossible to find!  Beware of the cannons if you get triggered like I did."
1434,Date of experience: November 2019,10-Nov-19,ACC,California,5,Always Fun Times Watching Cal Football at Memorial Stadium,"We enjoyed watching the Cal Bears beat Washington State Cougars 33-20 On Nov. 9, 2019.  We are Cal Bear season ticket holders and enjoy going to the games.  Its fun to watch college football at Memorial Stadium.   The cheerleaders are fun to watch.  The Mascot Oski is always a delight.    We have good seats with good views.  We also enjoy listening to the Cal Band.  The one thing Cal messed up this year was taking care of people who need special assistance to the game. First, they got rid of the golf carts.  Secondly they got rid of easy access gates into the game  In short, the one thing that Cal did wrong in 2019 was making it much harder for people with disabilities to attend the games.  This must be addressed for 2020.   I have talked to a few people on this as we waited for the very tardy Cal Stadium Shuttle busses to take us to the game  Its a MESS this year."
1435,Date of experience: October 2018,19-Aug-19,ACC,California,3,Typical stadium,"Memorial Stadium is not the most advanced stadium, but I think that kind of part of it's charm. The stadium has food vendors surrounding the outer ring as well as port-ta-potties. If you have the money or are an alumni, you can opt to watch the game in the more expensive seats on the shaded side of the stadium. I've never sat on that side, but you do envy the shade if you are attending a game on warm day. If you happen to live near by, it's always better to walk to the game as parking can be expensive and a hassle."
1437,Date of experience: October 2018,6-Nov-18,ACC,California,3,"Cool, But Not Awesome","Visited the Stadium for the ill-fated appearance of the UW Huskies vs. Cal Bears.  This venue has much to offer, including picturesque sunsets, the beautiful hills that rise above the stadium (and the tightwads who gather there), and the friendly ambiance of fans who enjoy the game, win or lose.  That said, the stadium itself is in need of a remodel - it just cannot compete with the excitement generated among their competitors in the Pac-12 let alone national venues. The 2 ""jumbo"" screens look like 1950 televisions compared to the massive screens at Autzen or Husky Stadium.  Check out the Fan Zone at Husky Stadium, where all fans are invited to enjoy food, beer, games steps away from the field.  At Cal, this sort of perk is only available to the elite. ( Wow, thought Cal Berkeley was kind of the cradle of Democracy. Not so.) Most of the seating offered to Cal fans is bench back. Very few luxury seats = a lack of both comfort and excitement.  And, when the game is over, a long walk to find a place to grab Uber back to the hotel rather than a central area offered at so many other sports and concert venues. Cal fans are great. They deserve better."
1438,Date of experience: October 2018,2-Nov-18,ACC,California,4,First Ever College Football Game??,"Visited for the Bears vs. Huskies game (Oct. 2018); took the BART from SF (40mins) to Downtown Berkeley and then a free shuttle bus, that drives through the stunning Berkeley Campus and drops you off a few 100 yds. from the very impressive (63,000 seat) Memorial Stadium. The entire experience from tailgate party, entrance, security, food outlets, pre-match, no segregation (take note UK) was excellently managed.  One minor issue; the seating (benches) is very tight (luckily there were a few empty places around us; with a capacity crowd ?? it would have been a tight squeeze).During the game; the atmosphere (approx. ??+ full stadium) was largely manufactured and tame, even with a decent following travelling from Washington/Seattle????. I suspect a game against Stanford would be a different affair.  The game, wasn??t the best, a tight 12-10 victory for the Bears, so, at least the majority of the crowd went home happy enough.After, the game; the free shuttle didn??t leave for 30 minutes ?? so, we walked back to the BART (about 30mins.); where the station was full.The BART platforms & trains, after the game, were packed out (trains not very frequent; considering it was a game day) and they didn??t run directly back to SF, negating a tricky change (for out of town??ers) two stops down the line. Pros: Stunning Setting & very well managed.Cons: Seating.Visit again: Thinking; maybe, I??ll likely stick with the NFL."

In the Heart of UC-Berkeley, this Stadium (home of ""The Play"") felt like a time machine.  Its simplicity, but yet an engineering jewel (plus the NorCal weather), makes this a perfect place to enjoy a great afternoon's sporting event."
1440,Date of experience: September 2017,5-Aug-18,ACC,California,4,Really cool stadium!,"The coolest thing about this stadium, aside from the Berkeley area surrounding it, is the fact that it's basically dug into the side of a hill.  Big fan of sunk-in stadiums, I think it enhances the intimidation factor when at the top of the actual stadium seating there are hundreds more fans standing on the outside fences cheerin on the Bears"
1443,Date of experience: October 2017,22-Mar-18,ACC,California,4,Nicely Rebuilt,"The original on this same site was earthquake damaged, and it is good to have it rebuilt and reinforced."
1445,Date of experience: September 2017,30-Dec-17,ACC,California,4,Most Beautiful Stadium View in the World?,"What a shame so many of Cal's football games are at night when the stadium on a fall afternoon is almost certain to be sunny and clear.  It gives the fan an opportunity to climb up to the top rows to look out over San Francisco Bay at the gorgeous Golden Gate Bridge, the mountains in Marin County as well as the San Francisco skyline.  If you are visiting the Berkeley campus area not during a football game, you might still find an open gate.  It would give you the opportunity to climb up high for the view."
1446,Date of experience: September 2017,19-Oct-17,ACC,California,3,Cal football Stadium from 1923 remodeled in 2010-2012,"Cal Memorial Stadium opened in 1923 and is on the National Registry of Historic Places.  But its location built directly on the active Hayward Fault and resulting seismic damage and instability necessitated a reconstruction and retrofit.  From 2012-2012 the entire west side of the stadium was demolished and reconstructed and the level of the playing field was dropped by four feet to allow better viewing from the lowest rows.  We discovered on our recent visit for the USC vs. Cal game, that the bench seating on the west side there was good sight lines but poor leg room and seat space.  A rented chair back with a seat cushion was a lifesaver.  Concessions were typical game fare with few gluten free options.  The view from the west side of the stadium looking back over the bay toward San Francisco was excellent, but the hike up the hill to reach the stadium was exhausting!On the hill overlooking the north east corner of the stadium there were large crowds watching the game from afar - learned later that the area was nicknamed "" tightwad hill."""
1447,Date of experience: September 2017,24-Sep-17,ACC,California,1,Horrible Stadium.,"Old stadium and very difficult to get around. ""Jumbotron"" is anything but jumbo. If your seats are any where close to the bottom, be prepared to have people walking in front of you constantly. The only other way to get to the bathrooms are to climb up fifty rows. The security staff was very unprofessional and at one point, I saw them laughing instead of trying to break up a scuffle. I will never go back."

Cal won 33 to 20.We are season ticket holders so have good seats.  We also have reserved parking.During the game, they were also honoring other sports championship athletics such as for swimming, rugby, diving, basketball and so forth. It was fun to see.Oski the Bear is the mascot of Cal.  We also watched the cheerleaders, dance teams, and band.They also have a cute ""Bear Roar"" where three young kids compete to see which roar the audience likes.  The one that has the best ""roar"" sound gets a big stuffed bears.  The other two competitors get smaller bears.They also experimented during this game to have a 15 minute half time instead of 20 minutes.Memorial Stadium is a good stadium to see a football game at."

This stadium was very cool and had by far the best views of any I've been to.  Sitting in the hills and looking over the entire Bay was very cool."

Getting into the seats was a mess, no staff to direct and the set up was a disaster.  You had to climb over people to get to sections OR climb 50 steps up and over.  Very poor design.  Really put a bad taste for the experience."

The stadium was full of high energy Texas and Cal Fans.   Cal Bears won 50 to 43.The Cal Band entertained both at pre-game and at half time.   At half time also Cal Berkeley honored many of the athletes who were in the recent Summer Olympics in Brazil.  Some played for the US; others for other international countries.There were the enthusiastic and talented cheerleaders to entertain.Cal Oski, the Cal Mascot, also was there as well as the mascot for the Texas Longhorns.The stadium is also called Kaboom Field so the scoreboard will say ""Kaboom"" when Cal Bears score a touchdown.The game was televised also on Pac-12 as well as ESPN TV so the game went from 7:30 till about midnight.They also do various presentations and fan participation activities.  A very young toddler won a huge stuffed black bear when she ""roared"" the best out of 3 children participants to see who could roar the loudest."

1459,Date of experience: November 2015,20-Apr-16,ACC,California,3,Cal Stadium ...just a big circle,"Being a Sun Devil fan, it sucked because we lost. That aside, all the Cal fans were very hospitable and classy. The stadium seemed small, because I'm so used to Sun Devil stadium. The game was easy to see because the whole place sits fairly low to the field. Gorgeous location among the trees and a nice frat row. Super easy for a handicapped person to see a game. Very ADA compliant."
1460,Date of experience: October 2015,8-Feb-16,ACC,California,5,Great Cal Stadium!,This stadium replaced a smaller one and is a much more exciting experience. It holds sizable crowds and is well designed for football games and other events. The Cal Games are fun!  Sit on the west side if possible; otherwise the sun is in your face for too much of the day.
1462,Date of experience: December 2015,6-Jan-16,ACC,California,5,FootBall Game at Cal,The stadium has been beautifully rebuilt and is a great sports venue with a magnificent view of San Francisco and the Bay.

1464,Date of experience: November 2015,27-Nov-15,ACC,California,5,Best place to watch a game,"Even before its renovation, Memorial Stadium was the best place in the country to watch college football.  It's an old-style stadium that retained its atmosphere after its renovation and modernization.  The views of the bay area are spectacular!"
1465,Date of experience: October 2015,31-Oct-15,ACC,California,5,"Fun to See the Cal Bears Play, the Band Play, and Oski the Bear at Memorial Stadium","We are Cal alum and season ticket holders so have been to Memorial Stadium many many times.  Its a fun place to go and cheer on the football team. Its fun to see college football players and we have seen some go on to be major stars in the NFL (Aaron Rogers, Marshawn Lynch for example).The mascot for Cal is the Oski Bear.Since the football stadium is on the hill, one can also get good views of the UC Berkeley campus as well as of the San Francisco Bay Area.   The Cal Band also plays during the football game.Memorial Stadium has been remodeled so the seating now is much more comfortable than it was a few years ago.  The reason for the remodeling is that Memorial Stadium is on an earthquake fault and they needed to make safety changes.  They also made a much more elaborate sports box area.Parking is difficult for the game so its encouraged to take public transportation such as BART.  One can find pricy places to park in the Greek (fraternity/sorority section) close to the stadium if they do not have season parking permits and if they are not taking BART or public transportation.Its always fun to go to a game and see the Pac 12 teams. Cal has gone to some after season bowl games in the past.  However being a Cal fan means putting up and enjoying that this is a college sport where one can see sometimes great play and other times - its not so good.  Its all fun though.There is a pregame show (about 20 minutes before football kickoff) and also an intermission where one will see the bands play.  There is also an after football game show.As such, one is usually at the game 3 to 4 hours.There are also various congratulation events (i.e. best athletes, professors) and fan events one can see throughout the game when football is not going on."
1466,Date of experience: September 2015,19-Oct-15,ACC,California,5,College Football is a lot of fun!,"I highly recommend you attend a Cal Berkeley Football home game if you are in the area at the time of a game.  The audience is almost as much fun to watch as the game.  There is a large student section and the students are engaged during the entire game.  If you are not in Berkeley, then I highly recommend you take BART from wherever you are (Fremont for South Bay) to downtown Berkeley and then walk through campus to the stadium.  All times I've taken BART to a game, most of the BART riders will also attend the game.  This is particularly ""fun"" during the Stanford/Cal game, where a lot of the fans from both Universities live in the Bay Area.  If you decide to take this choice, once you cross the street to head to campus, walk straight towards the tower and then continue on beyond that to get to the stadium.  You'll probably be walking with an entire crowd from BART to get to the stadium.Check the Berkeley website for home games.  You can purchase tickets from the Berkeley website (and often get pretty good prices - especially for students or seniors) - or you can purchase from places like StubHub.   The Berkeley ticket website is pretty good and you can see and select the exact seat you are getting.In my opinion, this is a fun thing to do, even if you do not have ties to Berkeley."
1473,Date of experience: October 2019,20-Oct-19,ACC,SMU,5,Super COOL stadium with great fans AND great experience!,It is probably best to ??caveat?? this review with a comment that you should attend the SMU Mustang football team is on an unbeaten streak and beats the visiting team!  The stadium is built into the ground slightly so that the south end is mainly a grassy hill that you can sit on and ??picnic.??  The outside is brick which gives it an ??old world?? look which is quite beautiful.  THe field is turf and very soft.  The facilities including the bathrooms were very nice.  The servings during the game ranged from hot dogs to beer and pretzels.  The wine option was Chardonnay (for those who were wondering).  I was surprised since I attended on an NCAA-sanctioned event which typically prohibits this.
1476,Date of experience: September 2017,7-Sep-17,ACC,SMU,5,"Opening Weekend at SMU Campus in Dallas, Texas","Easy to walk to and find your seat. The concessions were good, and even in the corner of the end zone we saw the game at every angle. This stadium is what every college football stadium should be: on campus, cozy, clean, convenient, classic, and collegiate. The next game is Sat. Sept. 9, 2017 against rival NTSU. The game starts at 6PM so bring your sunglasses, and enjoy college football."
1477,Date of experience: November 2016,1-Dec-16,ACC,SMU,4,Good Little College Football Stadium,"This is a newish 32,000 capacity stadium on the campus of SMU University.Horseshoe in design with 2 tiers of seating, except for the usual executive box / press facility glass structure on the home side of the field.The open end of the horseshoe is taken up by by a grass bank with a large screen score board and children's play area. One of the cleanest stadiums I have ever been in but it could do with upgrading the seating to seats as benches are not fit for purpose in the 21st century.Was there on a glorious sunny day so saw the stadium in all it's glory but there is no cover anywhere so wrap up warm or the rain if the weathet is bad"
1478,Date of experience: October 2016,3-Nov-16,ACC,SMU,4,Great stadium,We went for the University of Houston vs SMU game. Very comfortable seats with a nice selection of food items.

1480,Date of experience: November 2015,7-Jun-16,ACC,SMU,5,Great college atmosphere,"Big time sold out college football atmosphere if the SMU Mustangs are playing a former SWC opponent such as A&M, TCU, or Baylor. Mustang Band will always put on a great show, and the football team is improving under Chad Morris.  Great pre game party (not sure I'd call it tailgating) on the Boulevard to the northwest of the stadium.  Parking pretty scarce near the stadium. Park in the Mockingbird Station lots east of Central Expwy, and take the free shuttle or walk (1/2 - 3/4 mile) to the stadium.  If the Mustangs are playing an AAC opponent,  seats can be plentiful, and you can almost sit where you want.   Great venue for high school playoff games as I've watched my Longview Lobos there 3 times.   Ladies need to trade out their purses for clear plastic purses as you will we wanded for weapons and clear bags inspected.  Binoculars worn around neck or in clear plastic bag."
1481,Date of experience: September 2015,5-Oct-15,ACC,SMU,5,No bad seats,"We attended the NTSU/SMU game and had a ball.  The pre-game atmosphere was a lot of fun.  Got to mingle with the cheerleaders from both teams, as well as watch the SMU Alumni band play.  Lots of tailgating going on.  Once inside the stadium I game it a ""walk around"" to see what the seating would be like from top to bottom.  It was all good.  Inside there were plenty of restrooms to accommodate the large crowd, and enough variety of food to satisfy the normal fan.  I also was surprised to see several food trucks along the end zone, behind the scoreboard/video board.  It was HOT, so I decided to get a snow cone, or shaved ice whichever you prefer.  I got a large one, and it was only five bucks.  Not a bad deal at all.  It was also fun to see George W. Bush do the pre-game coin toss.  The only negative here may be a lack of parking nearby.  There were some lots that were on campus and many parking spaces seemed to be available for $20.  We avoided that by parking at the nearby DART Mockingbird Station, and using the free shuttle to the campus.  There was almost no waiting and after the game, it was easy to leave as well.  So, my suggestions would be to arrive early enough to walk the campus for some atmosphere, and to park off campus and find a free shuttle.  OH, ticket prices were very reasonable, enough you could take the kids for a fun afternoon."
1483,Date of experience: September 2015,5-Sep-15,ACC,SMU,4,Great Stadium,"After living in Dallas for 8 years, we finally made it to the stadium. Great venue! Easy to get in and out. All seats are really good. Beer is sold which is great. Parking is not great, so if possible, take public transportation (Mockingbird Station across the street) or a taxi."
1484,Date of experience: November 2014,1-Dec-14,ACC,SMU,2,Poor Concessions,"Try to park in the Moody Center Garage.  It is a straight walk to the stadium.  The seats have a back which I really loved.  I rated the stadium poor because even thought it was a small crowd (Black Friday 2014), the concessions had basically nothing to sell as they ran out.  Based on a conversation with one of the workers, it appears this may be a common occurrence.  So definitely have a filling meal before you visit this stadium"
1485,Date of experience: October 2014,4-Nov-14,ACC,SMU,2,Nothing Notable About This Stadium EXCEPT,"You will notice the stadium was remodeled sometime back and that parking is a real problem. What you will notice this season is the thousands of empty seats as SMU struggles to place a football team on the field. Oh they have a bunch of players but no team to speak of. The loosing season has already been cast for the year. You can more than likely sit anywhere you desire along with the other hundred or so fans that come on a  Saturday. They started selling beer, thinking that would help fill the stands. Nothing worse than a  few college students drinking too much and annoying other fans and patrons. Perhaps in the years ahead things will change but don't count on it for this season."
1486,Date of experience: November 2013,16-Oct-14,ACC,SMU,3,Average smaller stadium,I have season tickets to SMU football since its the only football in Dallas.  Stadium is accessible from DART Mockingbird station.  You can either walk or take a shuttle across the freeway to the stadium.  Lots of food options outside. Inside has the usual stadium options and a food truck in the endzone.
1487,Date of experience: September 2014,26-Sep-14,ACC,SMU,2,Some like it hot!,"This is not the place to be on a 95 degree afternoon, especially not on the sunny side.  It is brutal.  The metal benches get so hot you can't even sit down without branding your legs.  Not a good design feature for a location like Dallas.  The concession lines were excruciatingly long, and the vendors ran out of cold water.  $6 for a cup of soda with no refills.  Not a good experience."
1489,Date of experience: September 2012,12-Sep-12,ACC,SMU,5,"Great little stadium, but the experience is more than the sum of it's parts!","Background:  I earned a graduate degree from SMU in the early 1980's when games were played in Texas Stadium with no atmosphere. I avoided the team for over 20 years.Fast forward past the Death Penalty to the incredible decision to totally renovate the 1920's Ownby Stadium and return to the SMU campus and create a more intimate college experience And, wow, what a job they've done in just a few years.Getting to the game is easy with DART and SMU provides a courtesy shuttle from nearby Mockingbird Station, with free parking. Much easier and cheaper than parking on campus.For starters, the Ponies don't tailgate, they ""Boulevard"" along the shaded tree-lined Bishop Ave. There's lots of food (often free) and fellowship for fans and visitors.  The new Corral with lots of HDTV just opened, but I haven't visited yet.The SMU Alumni Band performs a pregame concert.  And, about 45 minutes prior to kickoff, Peruna, cheer squads, and the Best Dressed Band in the Land march them to the stadium to the stadium.  Consistently nominated as a top-20 tailgating experience.The stadium seats about 32,000 and is cozy with an open grassy and slanted end zone with some kid activities.  Good for younger kids, catch, frisbee, and a picnic. Basic tickets run $20-$35, except for when the big boys come to town.Food options aren't vast but decent and most of us have already gorged on food and beer on the Boulevard anyway. Bottled water is $4, but you can't bring in your own unless it's well hidden.The Mustang Band is the Hub of the SMU Spirit before, during, and after the game, with a short post-game concert. Even opposing fans tend to cheer Peruna as the little horse races across the field.  SMU football games are a remnder of what college football should be, rather than what it has often become.  We meet lots of people with no ties to either school school just for that reason."
1492,Date of experience: November 2019,2-Nov-19,Big 12,Arizona,4,Homecoming 2019,It's been about five years since I've been to this stadium. Not much has changed in the section I normally sit in. Other areas have had major renovations though. Bathrooms are clean. Staff is friendly. Good video screen for replays. Sound system works well. Not sure why they need to play five seconds of recorded songs in between each play though. Or play music when the band is playing. Pretty rude. But overall I think it's a decent football venue. The cheap seats are very affordable and the fans up there are often quite nice and fun to hang out with. Love watching the Pride of Arizona. Go Cats!
1493,Date of experience: December 2016,30-Dec-16,Big 12,Arizona,5,Arizona bowl!,"Great humans great atmosphere.. Love the fact that they sell beer..

1494,Date of experience: December 2015,11-Jan-16,Big 12,Arizona,3,Only one lot for tailgating for a bowl game?,The stadium itself was decent enough (even though AZ basketballpictures were on the stadium cups) but our group of 50+ was asked to move twice due to parking/tailgating/alcohol regulations?  Only one lot available to tailgate in (next to fraternity houses) where we could enjoy adult beverages- pretty lame!
1495,Date of experience: November 2015,15-Nov-15,Big 12,Arizona,4,Any venue is more fun with a win!,"Although the season went downhill, both games we attended were winners and it makes all the difference in the world sometimes. A solid home crowd adds all the energy to make the experience more enjoyable. This is an older stadium that has a some cosmetic work done. The jumbo screen on the south side is great. You may also want to consider where the sun will be during the day games early in the season. The south or west side will have shade later in the game. The southwest corner is a bit more economical. You can see the big screen and get in the shade. The best seats  imo is Section 105. It's partially covered overhead with TV's for replays and the CatClub. The north end zone is a newer section that's pretty comfortable to. (They both have the folding seats compared to bleachers. Padded chairs can be rented for $10. Cherry street parking garage is nice if you can get in, or we have utilized the private sector nearby for five bucks. People would probably prefer new venue, but I appreciate the nostalgia that goes with an older stadium."
1496,Date of experience: September 2015,27-Sep-15,Big 12,Arizona,1,Bad game was just the tip of the iceberg,"Arizona Alumnus, attending first football game in person in the Rich Rodriguez era. First game in person with wife, much less kids. I don't think the game experience could've gone worse, and the postgame experience been more frustrating and difficult, had I been at an ASU game. I wasn't happy, my kids weren't happy, and my wife, I think, had resolved by halftime never to return to Arizona Stadium again.Got into Tucson by 11 a.m. Saturday, spent over $100 on red caps, shirts, and a little cheerleading outfit for my girl at the Tucson Mall A Store. Lunch at Eegee's--everyone loved the pizza fries--then drove to campus and parked at Main Gate garage. This was to prove more than a little confusing to find coming back that night. More on that later.Was told at McKale Center that my print-at-home tickets weren't redeemable--they were just scanned at the gate. Cool. Asked about water fountains or restrooms anywhere nearby, because my kids were dehydrated. McKale Ticket Office rep said that we could go up the ramp to use the bathrooms on the main concourse.Son stopped on the way there to ask if we could enter sweepstakes for an autographed football. While there, got into a chat with the rep, who thought daughter was cute. Mentioned I used to work in McKale and wanted to make sure it was OK if we went up the ramp to use the restrooms. He said no. I told him that's what the McKale Ticket Office rep said we could do. He said McKale was closed for business and that we needed to find somewhere else.So now you have my email address and phone number and, in return, have told my family to go find water somewhere else. Really nice. Never mind that McKale has always had a concourse door unlocked for the public on game day with nary an issue for the last 40 years.But that's a McKale issue. We get over to Gate 2, but nope--if you have a SEZ ticket, you can't go under the east stands anymore through to the Sixth Street sidewalk, you have to walk around. Starting to wilt a bit, but OK.So we go all the way to the back of the line halfway down the street at Gate 9, and we're at security check. Apparently now that includes a purse search, because my wife got hers searched to the point where the security guard asked to search her wallet.It was bad enough she had to throw out the water bottles we had just picked up at the tailgate and dump the rest of the water out of her bottle (but can still take it in the stadium?!?!?), but now a person's WALLET is a security risk?There's no love lost between me and Tucson game security. Since I started going to football games there in '84, 50/50 shot you deal with someone competent or friendly, and the odds were never in our favor last night.""It's for your own protection,"" the guard said, pawing through our credit cards and cash. Just when I'm about to opine we only need protection from lousy security guards like her, she lets us in and we're able to find our seats.Have to take my daughter to the South End Zone bathroom before kickoff. Man, has that not changed, and I just pray my daughter doesn't ask me someday, ""Dad, why did you take me to that room to see all those guys peeing out of their wee-wees?"" Love those low urinals!But we find our seats, stadium slowly fills up, then all of a sudden everyone wants to cram in five minutes before kickoff. It was all handled as if nobody expected a sellout, with fat guy, old wife and clueless-looking son going ""plop"" and taking all but about 10 inches of my seat.""Season ticket holders"" at the end of the row tell me to show them their tickets, even though we got there nearly an hour before them. I told them that we were in seats 28-30 and that I didn't need to show them any more than that.So they call security to complain that we weren't in the right seats. I miss most of our first touchdown drive because I can't sit down--and, to top it all off, I'm screaming at this idiot at the end of my row ""28! 29! 30! Clear enough for you now?""Willie the security guard asks for everyone in the row to show their tickets. I do. ""So, sit down,"" he says. I point at the 10 inches let of my seat and then look at him, incredulous, and laugh, ""You're funny.""""Well, seats are going to be tight tonight,"" he responds, as if that somehow justifies his handling of what is escalating into a more and more ludicrous situation. Then he begs the rest of the row (none of whose tickets he checks) to move down and make room.So me, my wife, my son and restless, wriggling 3-year-old daughter are crammed into Arizona Stadium SEZ bleacher space equivalent to three seats. In fact, Willie said each ticket holder got 16 inches of space per seat. Are you kidding me?With fat guy's giant right thigh snuggling up on one side and my wife struggling to keep wormy daughter between her legs on the other, we settle in to watch another Arizona blowout loss to UCLA on national TV.At halftime, my wife takes daughter to bathroom again. Same security guard who smiled at them on the way down asks, on the way back, ""Do you have a ticket to be in the stadium?""Wife resists the urge to call this one an idiot, shows her papers and makes it back. Fat guy and brood leave by end of third quarter. ""We're out of here, brother. Spread your wings."" Yeah, why don't you buy two seats so I don't have to? My wife already has more medical issues than anybody should have to live with, she's suffocating in a stadium which no longer has a cool breeze for relief, and not one apology from anyone. I can live with a certain level of discomfort most of a game, but if it's too much for my family, it's too much, period, as far as I'm concerned.Finally, we leave to go back to our parking garage. We walk past two carloads of students wearing Wildcat red screaming f-bombs at each other about the meaningless Cincinnati Bengals game the next day.I had to check their colors to make sure these weren't Sun Devil fans. What has happened to ""We're Arizona. We're better than this?""Apparently we're not anymore. Wife just doesn't like what she experienced of Arizona Stadium, and I can't say I blame her. She won't go back. It's more than just about a game, it's about a family experience, and the one we had once the game started Saturday night was awful. God forbid that experience is typical for families of recruits, because if it is, you won't see upgrades in U of A football recruiting anytime soon."
1501,Date of experience: November 2022,13-Nov-22,Big 12,Arizona state,5,ASU Family Weekend,"Easy to get in and out, Great crowd! The opening of the game was exciting and halftime show was well done."
1502,Date of experience: November 2021,13-Nov-21,Big 12,Arizona state,5,Sun Devils Football Fun Experience!,"Fabulous football game against USC.  Sun Devils won!   There was a spectacular intro film of a giant Sparky walking through Tempe on the jumbotron at the beginning of the game. Very impressive film work.   This stadium is huge and impressive. It was Veterans night at the stadium.  There is a giftshop, and some simple dining options such as burgers and hot dogs.  A fox ran across the field during the game as well.  We parked in the Novus parking deck which is a short walk away.  This was a fun experience for the beginning of our trip to Phoenix!"
1504,Date of experience: January 2020,19-Jan-20,Big 12,Arizona state,2,Awaken2020,"While the conference was amazing, the stadium is not somewhere I would ever attend again. Once inside, we couldn't leave. The only food was junk food. The event was from 10am to 10pm and they ran out of hamburgers at 2pm, the only item in the entire place that I could eat. Needless to say, by 6pm I was starved and left the event earlier than planned missing an import aspect of the conference."
1505,Date of experience: September 2019,23-Dec-19,Big 12,Arizona state,4,"Updated Stadium, but Lots of Stairs",Great place to watch a football game.  Plenty of food and drink vendors.  Uber is not available close in.
1506,Date of experience: December 2019,16-Dec-19,Big 12,Arizona state,5,Update of the Stadium was a Complete Success!,Sun Devil Stadium had been old and tired for more than a decade but those days are gone! The construction is complete and the new state-of-the-art stadium is one ASU should be very proud of!!!
1507,Date of experience: November 2019,25-Nov-19,Big 12,Arizona state,5,Saw Upset of Oregon!!,"In town for Ironman and staying at a hotel steps away from the stadium. Knowing Arizona St was playing #6 Oregon and hoping for a big upset made for an intriguing evening activity. Had my brother not needed to rest, he would have loved to go. We decided to proceed with our normal pre-Ironman activities like mass, dinner, and low-key night and early bed time. We did go watch the fans enter the stadium before the game and then headed to dinner. When it was 7-7 my boyfriend and I made the decision to see if we could get tix for second half while brother went back to rest. We were so excited to get tix for $45 each. We just wanted to be a part of it!  We got there late and didn??t even sit in our seats. We stood in a great spot and what was cool was they let people do this. The view was great! The crowd was fun!  And we saw a huge upset!!  Loved seeing the fans storm the field. Loved the music played to pump up the crowd. Just a very electric atmosphere!  Would I be giving this place 5 stars if the game had been lame? Who knows!  Who cares! Stadium is nice with ample bathrooms close by.   Concession stands looked to have crazy long lines so not sure if that is typically an issue or not.  Kind of neat to to visit a new stadium so glad we had the chance. Go Sun Devils!"
1508,Date of experience: October 2019,13-Oct-19,Big 12,Arizona state,1,RIP OFF!,"I was charged $26.00 for two Miller Lite Beers, in cans. I can buy a 12 pack of Heineken for $13.00. Captive audience taken advantage of by unscrupulous vendors! Boycott Sun Devil stadium! This is highway robbery, a genuine, for real RIP OFF!"
1509,Date of experience: October 2018,25-May-19,Big 12,Arizona state,5,Great place to see a ASU GAME,Really fun to see football games. I found all seats  have good views of the game. Lots of fun to see ASU PLAY. Lots of good parking and easy to get around
1511,Date of experience: January 2018,30-Dec-18,Big 12,Arizona state,3,remodeled stadium,the stadium has been remodeled and it needed it it is an Old stadium not sure how nice it is now as I have not been since the remodle
1512,Date of experience: December 2018,10-Dec-18,Big 12,Arizona state,3,Newly renovated but air still doesn't flow thru the stadium,"Spent millions renovating, including taking out the south end zone seating (2nd level) to imporve airflow.  It can be stifling in the stadium even though outside is OK.  Beware of going to football games here before October ..."
1513,Date of experience: November 2018,1-Dec-18,Big 12,Arizona state,5,Football Game,Nice stadium and good location in Tempe. Food on each level. easy entrance and good site-lines. Lots of parking around the stadium but you can also park about 20 minutes away and walk along the canal to the field.
1514,Date of experience: September 2018,8-Nov-18,Big 12,Arizona state,3,"Nice stadium, low intensity fans","First and foremost, I was here for the marching band, as my son is a freshman in the band.  I have to say they are really good and a lot of fun to watch, too bad there weren't many other people there to see it.  I've been to conference games in other places, like Ohio State, Clemson, U of South Carolina, and even Marshall.  I found the crowds at all of those places more ""into it"" as there were lots of empty seats during the game, and even with a decent lead, just about everyone seemed to leave by the beginning of the 4th quarter.  So, while the venue itself is nice, although going to the upper deck sure could have used an escalator option, it's just an okay overall college football experience.  On the other hand, you could bring a kid there, as it's less likely that you'll run into jerks.  Also, some of the canned music and sound effects are really just obnoxious.  More band, less recordings would be nice."
1515,Date of experience: October 2018,19-Oct-18,Big 12,Arizona state,4,Newly renovated,"My wife and I came to a Stanford vs ASU game in October. The weather was great, around 80 at kickoff and 70 and game end. The signage getting to the stadium was clear, and getting in was a well organized. We arrived early so we could walk around and see the stadium which is clean and well maintained. The food choices were good, with a number of chains offering their fair and a number of small, local places serving their creations too. I don't think there is a bad seat in the house, but be aware, if you sit in the corners, the seating is bleacher style without backs."
1516,Date of experience: September 2018,9-Oct-18,Big 12,Arizona state,5,Great Stadium for College Football,Went here to watch the Sundevils play Michigan State.   Incredible experience.  This stadium has been improved and upgraded recently.   Tailgate before in one of the parking lots around the stadium.  Lots of bars and restaurants nearby on Mill Ave.   Highly recommend!
1517,Date of experience: September 2018,1-Oct-18,Big 12,Arizona state,4,Cool Place to Watch a Game,"Love coming hear to watch the Sun Devils play. Great views from most seats, and easily walkable from town. Always meet friendly people there too. Food prices pretty reasonable."
1518,Date of experience: January 2018,5-Aug-18,Big 12,Arizona state,2,Rivalry game,Huge packed house great lines of sight and fun atmosphere stadium logics easy enough to find everythingYou however can not walk around the whole stadium it's more of s horseshoeThere was no parkingTake the light rail and get dropped off in frontBring a cushion as the bench seating is cold and heart plus no seat backSo many people made it hard to move around the concourse
1519,Date of experience: September 2017,21-Feb-18,Big 12,Arizona state,5,Awesome Game,It was easy to find our seats and maneuver through the stadium. Really enjoyed the game that we went to.
1520,Date of experience: January 2018,11-Jan-18,Big 12,Arizona state,4,Another big stadium,"We came here just for the hell of it, and it was fun, however it is just another big stadium. It's close to a lot of other stuff so while in the area why not see it"
1521,Date of experience: October 2017,22-Nov-17,Big 12,Arizona state,3,My butt couldn't take it,"Went to an ASU football game.  They play mostly all night games due to the weather (heat).  The stadium itself is very nice.  Good lines of sight.  City bus can be ridden almost to the front door of the stadium.  Crowds are enthusiastic. There are many concession choices.  All in all a very nice college football stadium, until you get to the seats.  All aluminum bench seating with no backs or side arms, you just sit there for 3-4 hours on a metal bench.  It was terrible.  No wonder they rent padded seats with backs.  After spending 180 dollars for 2 tickets, I should not have to shell out another 20-30 so my butt can survive the game.  Not a real good time."
1522,Date of experience: October 2017,9-Nov-17,Big 12,Arizona state,5,Great time!!!,"My son and I attended a ASU vs. Washington Huskies game in October, 2017.  It helped quite a bit that it was one of the best games that ASU has ever played and that people ran out on the field afterwards, but the stadium is a wonderful environment.  Since I was traveling there and my son is a student at ASU, it was great that the school offers free tickets for students and discounted tickets for family members.  We enjoyed the game and security did a good job of keeping alcohol use under control and removing people out of control."
1523,Date of experience: October 2017,15-Oct-17,Big 12,Arizona state,3,Large Stadium Getting Larger,"Division 1 football at its liveliest.  Stadium is old but being renovated nicely.  Good viewing, loud and raucous fans."
1524,Date of experience: September 2017,26-Sep-17,Big 12,Arizona state,4,Good seats wherever you go,"I have been attending ASU football games for over 40 years and found that you can't seem to get a bad seat no matter where you sit.   When entering the stands, the long lines appear daunting, but it does seem like they get you in pretty quickly.  I think the only frustrating thing is, if you try and get season tickets you have to pay a donation fee which is ludicrous to me, so have opted out on season tickets."
1525,Date of experience: September 2017,10-Sep-17,Big 12,Arizona state,3,Great new video scoreboard....but,They need to get rid of the bleachers and install seats in all sections of the stadium.....they just renovated and missed the mark.Also bathrooms on the East side of the stadium were not renovated and are in need of it!!!  They were stiffing hot as well. Pros - all staff were very nice and friendly.  Several beer gardens throughout the stadium.  Some decent foot choices.
1526,Date of experience: September 2016,9-Jul-17,Big 12,Arizona state,4,Fear the Fork,Home to Sun Devil football - too bad the remodeling is reducing the number of seats and the south end zone is now the student section as I always felt this was the best section.  Long lines for the beer garden. Enjoy the excitement
1527,Date of experience: October 2016,2-Feb-17,Big 12,Arizona state,4,Blazing Sunshine,I love watching college football in a stadium instead of on TV. I wish I could go to more games. The stadium is kept pretty clean during the game so you really don't have to worry about stepping on food or spill drinks. I've never had much interaction with the staff other for them to scan my ticket. My only advice is to get a seat out of the sun's reach as when the sun sets it will BLIND YOU! We ended up moving a couple of times half way through the game before we learned our lesson.
1528,Date of experience: November 2016,15-Nov-16,Big 12,Arizona state,5,Great football stadium,I love the PAC12 stadiums and this one is one of my favorites! The atmosphere is fantastic for a football game. The downtown location is great if you want to grab dinner/drinks before a game
1529,Date of experience: October 2016,27-Oct-16,Big 12,Arizona state,4,Fun time (even though ASU lost)!,"While visiting our daughter at ASU, my wife and I experienced a Sun Devil football game against the Washington State Cougars.  Although we are from GA and are Bulldog fans, we now feel like we have been properly indoctrinated into the ASU ""family"".  Security into the building was easy and efficient, and finding our seats was very easy.  Drinks and food were not too outrageously prices.  The whole experience was a lot of fun!  If you can catch a game there, definitely go."
1530,Date of experience: October 2016,25-Oct-16,Big 12,Arizona state,4,A good place to watch ASU football,"Watched WSU defeat ASU last weekend.  Access into the stadium was easy and the entry screening was efficient and fast compared to others that I've seen.   Field views were great and the fans were loud, particularly on third downs.   ASU fans were fairly friendly to visitors.  Concessions were below average and service at them was very slow.  Plan on missing part of the game if you feel that you need to buy something at halftime."
1531,Date of experience: October 2016,10-Oct-16,Big 12,Arizona state,3,A very old building but being renovated,"Went for the ASU-UCLA game.  This stadium is iconic in a way, sandwiched between two mountains at ASU.  The field is oriented north-south.  The west side of the stadium has proper seats with backs, the east side is old style benches, very hard on the back.The food and beverage amenities are almost comic compared to modern college stadiums, but as mentioned they are in a major renovation stage.We were in the lower bowl which offers a tremendous view but is also largely populated by younger fans (they stand ... all the time).  I would consider low down seats in the upper bowl if you are over 30 years old.It is an easy 20 minute walk from the Mill Ave. bar / restaurant district so great for pre or post game food and beverage.It was fun but I wouldn't go back until the renovations are finished."
1532,Date of experience: September 2016,5-Oct-16,Big 12,Arizona state,5,Enthusiastic Arizona State Fans - Fun to See Cal Berkeley vs. Arizona State Game September 2016,"We like to go to at least one away game each season so this time chose the Arizona - Cal Bears Game on September 24.  It was a night game and we had purchased 40 yard line seats a few rows up from the field.  We parked at the Tempe library (free parking) and took the free Tempe Jupiter bus shuttle to the stadium and back.  On the way there the North; on way back South Jupiter.We liked the enthusiasm of the Arizona Sun Devils.  Its easy to enjoy food and drink in the numerous restaurants in the Mill Avenue area prior and after the game. At the stadium there is also on site beer gardens and usual stadium type food.The stadium is huge.  We looked up and up to see the press box area at the top of the stadium.The game was close and although we lost 41-51 it was fun being around the energetic Arizona Sun Devil Fans.We also enjoyed seeing the Arizona band marching into the stadium and during the game and half time show.  We watched the Sun Devil mascot doing the push ups in line with the score of their team.  We saw the Chick Filet Cow.During half time, they also had a tribute to the 2016 Arizona State Athletics that recently participated in the 2016 Olympics in Brazil.  In particular I liked seeing the superb men's swimming coach Bob Bowman.It was family day at Arizona State so besides enjoying seeing the Arizona State cheerleaders they also invited a lot of the young children fans to participate in the pre-game and during the game cheers and activities.The weather was perfect and we enjoyed seeing the numerous fireworks as well.So all in all, we were very happy to choose this as our away game.  (Note: There was only a handful of Cal fans it seemed at the game.)Their scoreboard is good. They are in progress of a full renovation of the stadium.It was also a long game ending around 10:30 or so as it was a nationally televised game."
1533,Date of experience: September 2016,28-Sep-16,Big 12,Arizona state,5,Great experience,Great atmosphere! We sat in section 31 Which is behind the visiting teams bench. I didn't know that that side of the stadium were bleacher seats. It made for a very uncomfortable game. I would make sure to sit on the opposite side behind the Sun Devils bench because those are actual seats. You can rent seat cushions for the bleacher side but it still looked uncomfortable.
1534,Date of experience: September 2016,13-Sep-16,Big 12,Arizona state,4,Classic under renovation.,ASU plays at night due to high summer heat.   Still under a bit of construction but still fun and full service.  Go Devils!!!!
1535,Date of experience: September 2016,7-Sep-16,Big 12,Arizona state,3,Fantastic View from the Seats but............,We enjoyed watching the 2016 ASU-NAU game from our seats in section 238 but whoever designed them should be fired or forced to go there themselves! They are metal bench seats with absolutely no room to let anyone by should they need to get up or someone trying to get to their seat! The prices they charge for food beverage will keep us from attending anymore games. But I guess that seems to be the case at all sporting venues. Too bad.
1536,Date of experience: September 2016,5-Sep-16,Big 12,Arizona state,3,A Work in Progress,"The stadium is perfectly placed at the base of iconic Hayden Butte and is currently in process of an extensive, desperately needed remodel. So here is a critique on the progress thus far. The wide ramps provide convenient, accessible access to nearly every seat in the house. Golf cart transport is available for the older, less mobile Sun Devil fans. Seat backs have bee added to the upper level 'cheap' seats - Thank-You. More restrooms are still needed, not the potra-pottys. The sound system is awful! The feed from the referees is inaudible. The dialogue track on the video feed is drowned out by the music feed. The sound distribution should be better balanced throughout stadium. The video screens are too small, though the resolution is excellent. Looking forward to the completed project. Go Sun Devils!"
1537,Date of experience: August 2016,13-Aug-16,Big 12,Arizona state,5,Awesome Arena,"What a cool place to see and visit, awesome location and the mountains are great!  Really cool place to visit and see."
1538,Date of experience: October 2015,26-Jul-16,Big 12,Arizona state,4,Open air stadium,Being from Ireland it was a pleasure to be here in a T-shirt.Fine stadium and given the Phoenix heat the pitch was in great condition.Really enjoyed it.
1539,Date of experience: October 2015,29-Jun-16,Big 12,Arizona state,4,The Devil in You,"Stadium is a great place to watch a football game. Sun Devils have a good following but the stadium and the amenities have aged. The good news is that the Sun Devil Stadium is under renovation and will be ready for the 2016 football season. So let's see what improvements were made and how it will make watching a game there more interesting......regardless, if you want some big time football action go there."
1540,Date of experience: November 2015,22-Jun-16,Big 12,Arizona state,5,Excellent College Football Stadium!,"Excellent College Football Stadium to watch the ASU games at. The stadium has great services, offer some great fireworks & smoke during scores. Has had a lot of construction going with a wonderful future in store for fans. The stadium staff makes things move efficiently with a totally awesome to day/night at a college game. Not a bad seat in the house. The game I attended was a night game so it wasn't hot. Mill Avenue District which is close by has lots of nice restaurants & bars to check before & after game time too."
1541,Date of experience: September 2015,28-May-16,Big 12,Arizona state,5,Stadium signage,Loved the displays and how flawlessly and clearly they operated to keep the fans informed and enteratined
1542,Date of experience: September 2015,21-Apr-16,Big 12,Arizona state,5,A great place to watch a football game,This was a great experience to watch a football game.  The games have to be at night because it was so hot.  However the place was rocking and the crowd was into the game
1543,Date of experience: December 2015,10-Feb-16,Big 12,Arizona state,3,Has the good ol College feel!,"For this to be home for ASU Sun Devils, it is a good College venue. Close to food, attractions, campus and shopping. The only downfall was missing the beers at the Fiesta Bowl. Seat are good, staff are friendly, food options were ok. Overall would recommend to catch a Devils game there."
1545,Date of experience: October 2015,13-Nov-15,Big 12,Arizona state,5,Great Venue,First time at this stadium and was awesome.  Despite rain it was a great night.  Food choices are numerous and reasonably inexpensive.  Lots of fireworks after big plays and crowd was well behaved and very energetic.  Nice venue
1546,Date of experience: October 2015,1-Nov-15,Big 12,Arizona state,4,Enjoyable Venue,"Sun Devil stadium is a pretty good venue. We sat on the upper deck and felt like we had great seats. The price was good, everything was easy to find. We parked off the light rail and took it to the ASU game."
1547,Date of experience: October 2015,22-Oct-15,Big 12,Arizona state,5,Great stadium for watching the Arizona State Sundevils!,"Great stadium in Tempe, AZ.   Stay at Tempe Mission Palms and walk over to the stadium.   New rail cars can drop you right in front of the stadium as well."
1548,Date of experience: September 2015,14-Oct-15,Big 12,Arizona state,5,Fun to watch Sun Devils lose!,I have been to Sun Devil Stadium four times and have not seen the home team win yet. The fans are fairly fair -weather....excited at the start of the game but leave in droves at halftime if their team is behind.
1549,Date of experience: September 2015,29-Sep-15,Big 12,Arizona state,4,Awesome stadium for a game,"In town for the USC - ASU football game. The stadium was great, lots of services, great fireworks and boom cannons with smoke. You can see some construction going on behind the scenes so it looks like the future will even be better. The staff make things move efficiently and the whole place is just awesome to experience a college game. Not a bad seat in the house. The game I attended was a night game so it wasn't hot. Good job ASU. Surrounding area has lots of nice restaurants and bars. The area is very clean, and they even have a huge park with trails and a lake right next to the stadium. We will return!"
1550,Date of experience: September 2015,29-Sep-15,Big 12,Arizona state,5,Hot and Rockin- ASU Sun Devils vs USC,"Easy access nice stadium. It is hot in Tempe thru September, but, the stadium is easy access for ASU Football. We were there for Parent Weekend game vs USC."
1552,Date of experience: September 2015,15-Sep-15,Big 12,Arizona state,1,Garbage Stadium With Quiet Fans,"Attended the ASU Cal Poly game last week and I was sorry I did. This venue is very old and outdated. Horrible food, obnoxious fans, and horrible restroom facilities. Very low class. Make sure you put plastic covering on the seat you are in as this so called university has the highest per capita rate of std's of any university in the nation. Players cheerleaders, band members and fans have been pelted with beer, rocks, and other objects hurled by drunk fans. If I could give any advice to fans of opposing teams if you are in a small group or especially alone do not wear your teams gear or root for your team too loudly as you will be harassed by Sun Devil fans the entire game. Classless"
1553,Date of experience: September 2015,14-Sep-15,Big 12,Arizona state,5,great time,"very nice stadium, the ASU team spirit is awesome.  Went to my first home game this past weekend as a guest of someone who had seats in section 103.  If you are a frequent flier here it is worth the upgrade in seating as this section provides a tasty meal, all you can drink soda, ice cold H2O, unlimited popcorn & peanuts along with  and line free ladies rooms!  GO DEVILS!"
1554,Date of experience: December 2014,26-Aug-15,Big 12,Arizona state,4,EXCITING FOOTBALL IS BACK AT SUN DEVIL STADIUM!,"Nothing like college football! It's great to see the Sun Devils competitive and a top ranked team. Thanks Todd Graham! Now...the stadium badly needs a renovation. Slowly, the university is renovating the stadium. It's in a great location, with lots of parking."
1557,Date of experience: November 2014,8-Jul-15,Big 12,Arizona state,5,Fun Stadium,Came here with family for a foodball game and there was a great atmosphere for ASU vs. Notre Dame Football game.
1558,Date of experience: October 2014,22-Jun-15,Big 12,Arizona state,5,Excellent Stadium with Terrific Views of the Field,"A very good stadium, great for adults and children.  Great location, accessible parking, reasonable prices for refreshments, excellent choice of seats for viewing the stadium.  Walking distance for tons of restaurants and night clubs.  Light Rail is very accessible for the stadium."
1559,Date of experience: November 2014,15-Jun-15,Big 12,Arizona state,3,needs that facelift that it is presently undegoing,"I went to ASU years ago and have enjoyed many an evenings rooting for my Sun Devils in Sun Devil Stadium.  However, recently I've noted the the old lady is tired, in structural disrepair, needing sigificant upgrades to bathroom facilities and food locations and a fresh coat of paint.  The seat proximity to the field is close; there are very few bad seats.  But the physical plant was most constucted over 30 years ago and the great lady needs some help--which I understand is underway."
1562,Date of experience: October 2014,15-Mar-15,Big 12,Arizona state,5,Fantastic atmosphere.,We had a great time here last fall when the Utes came to town. Sad that the Utes lost but the audience wasn't too hard on us. There was a great view from our seats and we had an absolute best time. Food prices weren't terrible but they have to make their money somehow.
1563,Date of experience: November 2014,23-Dec-14,Big 12,Arizona state,4,Good university stadium,My son and I have season tickets to see all of the ASU Sun Devil home football games.   Scoreboard is good announcements are good and the replay screen is very easy to see.  There are plenty of good restaurants around the stadium and the food is good in the stadium.  Parking is a bit tough and expensive but there is also a light rail stop at the stadium with trains going both east and west.  This is the best way to get to the stadium.
1564,Date of experience: October 2014,11-Nov-14,Big 12,Arizona state,4,Nice Stadium,"Nice Stadium. Fun to look at and great views. Love that it's built between the MTS, Easy in and out. Not far from the airport. It's a must see."
1565,Date of experience: November 2014,10-Nov-14,Big 12,Arizona state,1,Awful stadium,"This is the worst college stadium I have ever been to.  Old, worn-out, uncomfortable.  Glad they are going to renovate it.  The scoreboard is hard to read.  The big screens are hard to see and you can't understand what they are saying.  And it's hot!  The sun doesn't go behind the stadium when you are sitting on the west side until 3:00 PM in November.  I'll never visit the stadium again."
1566,Date of experience: October 2014,28-Oct-14,Big 12,Arizona state,3,At least the home team won,"Average stadium.  Seems I arrived during a fight between the unions and management and very few folks knew where the handicapped parking was, how to get to my get or what get to enter or how to get there.  Once in the stadium I was sent on a couple of wild goose chases to try and find my seat.  Thankfully I arrived as the gates opened and had lots of time to find a seat.  Knowledgeable football crowd was a nice surprise, being a dry stadium was not a nice surprise.  Not that I need a beer to watch a game but it would have been nice.  The lemonade was very good though.  As far as college atmosphere...it was average, wasn't sold out for a top twenty match up with Stanford."
1567,Date of experience: October 2014,21-Oct-14,Big 12,Arizona state,5,Rennovation project on the way!,"Renovation project to include upgraded seats, and bigger screens so fans can enjoy the game while tailgating."

Fireworks all over!!Best & most economical place to park is West of Mills Ave (the main street in Tempe, AZ).  Dining is nearby & follow crowd to Sun Devil Stadium."

1571,Date of experience: December 2013,22-Jan-14,Big 12,Arizona state,4,typical stadium,I went there for the Buffalo WIld Wings bowl and was not happy with the seating at all.  I wish they had individual seats instead they had bleacher seating.  No back support at all.  Not good for someone who suffers from back problems.  The climb up to the stadium is hard to.  Thank god they offered rides on carts to those who couldn't make the climb.  That was a plus.  The parking is so far away for typical people.  We had a handicap placard so we were able to park near the entrance but if you can't park in that lot be prepared to walk a ways.  Other then that we didn't see anything different at this stadium that isn't at any other stadium.
1572,Date of experience: December 2013,15-Jan-14,Big 12,Arizona state,4,Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl at a great venue,"With all the stadiums we check out, Sun Devil Stadium turned out to be one of the best. The food was outstanding and reasonable and the ushers were knowledgeable and friendly. We loved how the entire stadium was covered with Buffalo Wild Wings paraphernalia. We would love to come back to this stadium in the future."
1573,Date of experience: December 2013,4-Jan-14,Big 12,Arizona state,3,Stadium needs a facelift,"We had a loge for the Buffalo Wild Wings bowl game.  Aside from actually having seats (not bleachers), sitting in the loge was not what I might expect.  There is steel and concrete all over and I felt removed from the game.The stadium could use an update."
1574,Date of experience: December 2013,29-Dec-13,Big 12,Arizona state,4,"Stadium is small, but that means no bad seats!","We went to the stadium for the Buffalo Bills Wild Wings Bowl Game. We were not sure about seating...and once we entered the stadium we walked around. We walked to the loge as well as the upper levels...and there really was reasonable seating everywhere. While the stadium is not new, it was a great place to see a football game! The facilities were well maintained and it was easy to find the stadium, find parking and find our way out of the area after the game."
1575,Date of experience: December 2013,29-Dec-13,Big 12,Arizona state,2,Yikes!  This place is decrepit!!,"Great views of the field from the stands but this place needs to be rebuilt from the ground up.  Rickety cement stairs, parking garage-like ramps that require lots of incline/decline walking up to higher levels.  Luckily for some fans, there are power transport carts available.  Restroom facilities--oh my!!!  Plenty of vendors for pricey beverages and calorie laden grub.  On the plus side, the light rail stops right at the Stadium, making the in and out a breeze compared to the traffic and ""full & closed"" parking facilities.   A cool open sky atmosphere.  Two newer screens planted atop and on one end of the field.  Fireworks make an event festive.   Lots of visible ""uniforms"" on the street and inside the stadium.  Although the location is desirable, with nearby tailgating, bars and eateries within walking distance, this venue has seen its day."
1576,Date of experience: December 2013,21-Dec-13,Big 12,Arizona state,4,Dated stadium but great atmosphere,"Was here for the 2013 PAC 12 Championship game.  It was nearly a sellout so it was a great environment for football.  If you are here for the experience, I recommend catching a game here.  However, if you are coming with a large family, it may be less than ideal.  It is a non-trivial walk to go around the stadium/up the hill, concessions are very limited, and bench seats are dated/not well marked.Good access to the lightrail (go early so the train cars don't fill up!) and a fun tailgate scene it seemed."
1577,Date of experience: November 2013,7-Dec-13,Big 12,Arizona state,5,Gooooo Devils Goooooo!,"Stadium is on the older side but still a classic place. Built basically on A Mountain on the ASU campus, this stadium is a great place to watch ASU football. They are renovating it rather soon to add shade to protect from the heat and updating all the facilities...so Sun Devil Stadium should be even better!"
1578,Date of experience: October 2013,25-Oct-13,Big 12,Arizona state,4,Great Stadium to Watch a College Game,"Each year, a friend and I go west to take in a college football game and this year we chose the ASU/Washington game.  The stadium is neatly tucked between two small hills from which they shoot off fireworks after each ASU score.  Of the stadiums we've been to in the west, it was by far the best one and a great atmosphere for a college game.  It is an older stadium so the video boards, though very clear, are very small and is due an upgrade."
1579,Date of experience: September 2013,24-Oct-13,Big 12,Arizona state,3,Good facility and location,Only two small viewing screens.  Not enough bathrooms.  Long lines at concessions.  But win over USC was great!
1580,Date of experience: October 2013,14-Oct-13,Big 12,Arizona state,4,Go Devils!,"Don't understand why anyone is badmouthing this stadium!  It may not be the newest but it still has its own charm.  As for rude fans...we've been season ticket holders since 1986 and I have yet to find anyone who was rude, unless they were from the opposing (and losing) team.  Expect lines for restrooms and concessions but if you time things right you can avoid the halftime crush and have a whole different experience!"
1581,Date of experience: September 2013,19-Sep-13,Big 12,Arizona state,3,Not the best...,"The stadium is hard to get into and get to your seat, which is old metal bench seats throughout entire stadium.  When leaving we ended up having to walk around the entire stadium to get back to our hotel.  It was 97 degrees at 9pm so that may be why I'm so down on the place, lol...but the seating is NOT comfortable that is for sure.  Now if you sit in the lower seats you can see the game pretty well.  That was my only plus."
1582,Date of experience: September 2013,18-Sep-13,Big 12,Arizona state,2,Looks great from Outside,"Great location in the middle of a small mountain and adjacent to ASU's campus. Inside the scoreboards and video screens  are only on the south side of the stadium - very dated technology. The concessions are normal hot dogs and popcorn, but took forever to get through the line.  The bathrooms are hotter than you can imagine and they have troughs, really one step up from the outhouse.....  The saving grace is that the seats even in the upper deck have a good view of the game."
1583,Date of experience: September 2013,17-Sep-13,Big 12,Arizona state,1,A boiling hot dump.,"Avoid the stadium and watch the game on TV.  Rude fans, poor facilities, uncomfortable and crowded seating.  Seriously?  Should have been torn down years ago.  Something nice to say?  It is close to the restaurants and bars in the Mill Street district."
1584,Date of experience: September 2013,17-Sep-13,Big 12,Arizona state,4,Beat the heat! j/k,"I attended the ASU-Wisconsin game on 9/14 as an impartial observer. I saw in section 212, row 30, had great view of the entire field. It says hot even for evening games, so be prepared. I think you can bring unopened water bottles into the game (not 100%), but you can definitely bring empties in and refill at the water fountain. There was a large water cooler on the upper level that you could refill at as well. I didn't have any concessions. Men's room has troughs. There is a golf cart that can carry old people up the ramp to the 2nd level, but the line is long. Come early if you want that. The stairs are steep and there are no hand rails. If you have trouble with stairs - find something near the bottom of your level. I was surprised at how successful people were at getting alcohol into the stadium. Of course you're gonna see a few nips here and there, but I counted dozens of 12oz beer cans when I was leaving the stadium. If you wanna kill time before the game, plenty of watering holes on Mill St. Looked like a solid tailgate scene in the garages near the stadium as well. No idea on parking. If going directly from the airport - allow about 1:15 for Sky train + metro + walking. I hiked up ""A"" Mountain pre-game. Takes about 15-20 min up and 10 min down. It's hot. But you get a solid view of the city. And I don't really see how you can pass it up."
1585,Date of experience: September 2013,10-Sep-13,Big 12,Arizona state,4,"Great game, rude staff","The game was great, the bathrooms need an upgrade.If you buy drinks is not worth to pay for the loyalty cup.Buy your parking ticket from the internet because there is $30 dollars. Also you can  park in the University avenue area and get a ride from the ""taxi-bike"" for a tip.For 5 hotdogs and 5 drinks we spend $56 dollars. Everything was good until  one of the employee that was working in the merchandise section was really rude when I was trying to Buy  a shirt( I talk to other 2 employees because I wanted to make a formal Complaint But they said  that they did not know who I need it to talk) After the incident I decided to have fun and focus on the game."
1586,Date of experience: September 2012,5-Jun-13,Big 12,Arizona state,2,Ugh......,"This Stadium is open air and hot as hades so if you are a die hard Sun Devils Fan,  go ahead, but for anyone else, they are better ways to enjoy football, try the Universiyt of Phoenix Stadium which is Air Conditioned.."
1589,Date of experience: November 2012,11-Mar-13,Big 12,Arizona state,4,The Best Intro Ceremony in College Football,"The Sun Devils have, by far, the best introduction ceremony in college football complete with the video screen and fireworks. Too bad it's so incredibly hot during most of football season. They need to update their bathrooms. But all in all, a very exciting football experience. PS. Can the rap music before the game and get some crowd pleasing tunes on."
1590,Date of experience: December 2012,26-Jan-13,Big 12,Arizona state,4,Great Place for a Football Game,"We're from the Midwest and grew up as Michigan State fans.  We really enjoy a great college football venue.  This is a wonderful place to catch a football game, and PAC-10 action is great."
1591,Date of experience: December 2012,20-Jan-13,Big 12,Arizona state,2,Football game,"Came in last month for the bowl game.  Stayed in Phoenix and took the Metro to the stadium.  It was a short walk to/from transit stop to stadium.  Had great seats on the 20 yard line.  One thing I did notice is that the stairs are very steep going up. Handrails or similiar should be a must addition.Only thing I didn't like was the food selection. I had emailed Sodexho (or whatever they call themselves) 2 weeks earlier to see if there were any vegan options besides pretzels/popcorn.  Six weeks later, I am STILL waiting for a response from them.  The food selection here is so dead-animal-centric it was making me nauseous just by the smells alone.10+ stars for being transportation friendly-1 star for food selection-50 stars for customer no-service"
1593,Date of experience: November 2012,30-Dec-12,Big 12,Arizona state,2,Don't Sit on the East Side,"Although I love ASU, whoever designed Sun Devil Stadium with the metal seats baking in the sun all day needs to be fired.  September and even October games there are awful"
1594,Date of experience: October 2012,18-Dec-12,Big 12,Arizona state,3,Home of the Sun Devils.,In he summer months be sure to sit in the south end zone. You will be in shade for most of the game while others are fanning themselves from the sweltering heat. Go ASU!
1595,Date of experience: October 2012,10-Nov-12,Big 12,Arizona state,4,Great Day of Football ASU/UCLA,"Enjoyed the stadium, atmosphere, and fans. We had seats in the endzone (Sec 140? if I remember correctly.) Nice seats/setion as we were out of the hot sun and in the shade most of the game, but it's ""bench"" seating, so I suggest getting there early to orient yourself. People who came after kickoff had a hard time finding their proper seat. No beer sales to anyone not sitting in special sections...just FYI. After the game we headed to Mill Ave for postgame food and cocktails. Overall great football Saturday, just wished the Sundevils would have won!"
1596,Date of experience: September 2012,25-Oct-12,Big 12,Arizona state,5,Proud Sun Devil,"I'm biased because I'm an ASU grad, but this stadium is fabulous.  It has been built onto so much since I was there in the 1970's."
1597,Date of experience: October 2012,23-Oct-12,Big 12,Arizona state,4,ASU/Oregon,The access to the stadium is easy and the view from the very top is amazing. It also makes it more enjoyable when you win the game.
1598,Date of experience: November 2011,20-Aug-12,Big 12,Arizona state,5,ASU rocks and the football fans really rock the stadium!,"So much fun and energy to be at the game!  Win or lose, its always a great time.  Light rail stops right at the stadium so no need to worry with parking.  Bit of a hike to the upper deck so go prepared."
1599,Date of experience: October 2011,9-Aug-12,Big 12,Arizona state,1,Do not eat here,Old and ready to be remodeled.  Maintenance has lagged.  age has taken its toll.  To bad they just plan on dumping mega millions into remodeling rather than starting from scratch.
1602,Date of experience: November 2011,25-Jun-12,Big 12,Arizona state,4,Nothing better in the state for a great college football game when it is full,"When you are playing a quality opponent and the stadium is full there is nothing more fun that Sun Devil stadium.  When there are 40,000 fans versus Northern Arizona in August it is not so fun.  You are on top of the action because it is a football only venue.  That to me is the top draw.  Sure it needs to be updated with better bathrooms and seating but it has so much local history it is truly a gem."
1603,Date of experience: December 2011,16-Jun-12,Big 12,Arizona state,5,Can Wait for ASU Football,"The statium will be going thru renovations soon... however, we are VERY proud of our stadium.  Wedge tightly between 2 mountains.  There no place like Frank Kush field for great football."
1604,Date of experience: November 2011,8-Jun-12,Big 12,Arizona state,5,Football College Style,This stadium is Great to watch college football! Make sure to get there early so you walk around the stadium. The energy level is amazing and so much fun!
1607,Date of experience: January 2012,30-Apr-12,Big 12,Arizona state,3,Just Average,"I've attended MANY, MANY football games and concerts here. When it was upgraded (pressbox, etc), it was a really nice venue. Now it really needs a bit of upgrading again. It gets extremely hot at the beginning of the football season, if they do any day games, but most are at night. If you go when it's hot and it's during the day, be sure to sit on the west side of the stadium."
1609,Date of experience: October 2011,7-Apr-12,Big 12,Arizona state,5,football,a great stadium to watch football the ticket prices are a little high
1615,Date of experience: December 2011,25-Jan-12,Big 12,Arizona state,2,Not comfortable....  AT ALL!,"There are no seats in this stadium unless you have a suite.  The stadium is full of metal benches with the numbers SO badly worn it is difficult to tell where your spot on the bench should be.  This place would get more casual fans for the sporting events if the took out the benches and added proper chairs.  TIPS   1. Use the light rail to go to an event here.  it drops off right in front of the stadium.  2. Bring something to sit on.  Your backside will be numb if you don't3. If you can enter through the back of the stadium, do it."
1618,Date of experience: December 2011,5-Jan-12,Big 12,Arizona state,4,Great Venue,I always enjoy going to games here.  I love neighborhood the stadium is in.  Great bars and close to Mill Ave.
1619,Date of experience: December 2011,1-Jan-12,Big 12,Arizona state,3,Watch out for falling cameras!!!,"This was my first trip to Tempe and bowl game at Sun Devil Stadium.  Know what side you are sitting on and enter on that side of the stadium to avoid the mass of people walking in two directions near the concession stands, wow.  The upper deck sections are a bit removed from the bathrooms so look for seats on the lower deck, I can only assume there are more bathrooms down there.  And yes, 22oz beers are 12bucks, yikes. We did get to witness the camera fall to the ground and hit an Iowa player, no penalty."
1622,Date of experience: December 2010,30-Nov-11,Big 12,Arizona state,5,Great place to spend an evening,"For a school with very few local die hard fans, this place gets packed during football season. The team itself could be a little better, but they put on a great show, and it doesn't matter if they win or loose, there will be plenty of action on Mill Ave which is only a few steps outside of the stadium."
1623,Date of experience: October 2011,24-Oct-11,Big 12,Arizona state,4,Unique Stadium,"Sun Devil Stadium, home of the Arizona State Sun Devils (formerly shared by the Arizona Cardinals of the NFL). This stadium is quite unique in the way that it is built into the side of a rock in Tempe. The stadium allows itself to boost amazing views from the ""oxygen tank level or nose bleed section as some may call it."" The stadium is quite large being a former NFL stadium and hosts a wide variety of events throughout the year in addition to ASU Football games. The stadium is right on the light rail system allowing fans to ride the light rail to and from games with ease and the walk to the stadium is right across the street, the ride is quite safe and is not to crowded. The seats themselves from what I can remember being at the stadium twice (Fiesta Bowl 2001 Oregon State vs Notre Dame and 2011 Oregon State vs ASU) has mainly metal bench seating with some sections having backs. The most recent game I went to we sat in the oxygen tank level or nose bleed section which is quite a hike to get up to the seats, first off you have to wrap around multiple levels of ramps to get the upper level. I would advise those with medical issues to either take the golf cart shuttle they offer or see if they can request a lower level seat. The stairs to actually get to the seats are quite steep being that this is an older stadium there are certain things I think they got away with, in not having hand rails in the stairs on the upper level. The stadium is laid out in a way that leaves one to wonder that the stadium should be renovated again to allow for the attendance that they draw with outdated bathrooms and concessions that are outdated as well and cannot handle the numerous amounts of people who attend events here. Seeing that I believe they take the heat into consideration that they charge $6.00 for a 32 oz bottle of water, highway robbery if you ask me, but when we demand it the price will reflect it. All in all this stadium is one that I like and would go to a game here, being that the weather is almost always perfect and generally always there is quite a game being played there."
1629,Date of experience: September 2022,22-Mar-23,Big 12,Baylor,5,Beautiful Stadium!,"McClane Stadium is a beautiful stadium that is easy to get around to the different BU shops and concessions.  We like to sit in a different section and we haven't found a bad seat yet (unless you're in that Texas sun, of course!) Beautiful views of the Brazos, too."
1630,Date of experience: November 2021,20-Feb-22,Big 12,Baylor,5,Beautiful View of Baylor and Great Place to Watch Football,"McLane Stadium is a great place for football. However, it can be really hot in September for a day game and the seat is on the sunny side. There is not a bad seat in McLane to watch a game. I wish that there were a few healthy items at the concessions. They have done a great job with fasti W-Fi."
1631,Date of experience: September 2021,26-Sep-21,Big 12,Baylor,5,Great experience!,Every seat is a great seat! I was So worried when the only tickets left where at the top back. I was surprised! We could see everything and it really wasn't that far from the field. Had good shade on a hot day. Lots of food choices made it easy Pickens for everyone. Looking forward to the next game we get to make.
1633,Date of experience: September 2020,28-Sep-20,Big 12,Baylor,5,Terrific football venue!,"We were thrilled to get back to McLane stadium for the first Baylor football game since the COVID pandemic started and only the second sporting event of any kind on the Baylor campus since March 2020.McLane Stadium was limited to 25% capacity- about 11,000 fans.  Seating was arranged for social distancing and with the small  crowd, the concourses were not crowded.  Three were many measures designed to keep people safe and minimize risk of spreading the virus.The stadium was beautiful as ever and was a great spot to watch the game while the sun set!"
1636,Date of experience: January 2020,25-Mar-20,Big 12,Baylor,5,Enjoying the McLane Stadium,"What a beautiful Stadium. I like the name of it as well: ""McLane Stadium.""I like that it is all round. People can see it from the road and it is gorgeous!Next time I hope to see in a competition.Worthwhile to see!"
1637,Date of experience: October 2019,11-Mar-20,Big 12,Baylor,4,Great Baylor Football Stadium,"Only thing missing was beer!  Understand it's a college stadium but when it's only 32 degrees and you're sitting there, beer warms you up."
1638,Date of experience: October 2019,16-Feb-20,Big 12,Baylor,5,Family Friendly Stadium,If you have small kids consider getting tickets in the grass in the South End Zone.  Kids can play as you sit in the grass and watch the game.  Bring a blanket if you wish.  There is a concession stand close by.  Not recommended for big games such as Oklahoma or Texas as the area is pretty full.
1639,Date of experience: November 2019,9-Feb-20,Big 12,Baylor,4,Sunday brunch at a football stadium?  Yes!!!,"Very much a club atmosphere, but with a good, solid Sunday Brunch and lunch buffet.   Careful in their preparation, and staff really bend over backwards to accommodate any requests."
1640,Date of experience: January 2020,12-Jan-20,Big 12,Baylor,5,Very Nice,Went to the Baylor Club for a conference. It was banquet style seating which I hate. The food was served buffet style. To my amazement the food was top notch. Pork loin was very flavorful. The hit was the chicken fried steak fingers with gravy. Fresh salad and dressings. Highly recommended. Very nice
1641,Date of experience: December 2019,24-Dec-19,Big 12,Baylor,5,Suites are terrific,"Spent an evening in the suites.  The food and service were top notch.  Great setting!  Like the entrance area, but parking could have been more 'direct exit'."
1642,Date of experience: December 2019,14-Dec-19,Big 12,Baylor,5,Beautiful inside and outside??,"I eat at the Baylor Club often, that gives me the opportunity to dine outside looking down at the stadium. Very well designed, seems like the sight lines are fantastic. A real classy place for Baylor football and other events. But, I most enjoy walking around the outside of the stadium, particularly at sundown and early evening. Pass by the Baylor marina, the bridge that connects the law school and Baylor campus to the football stadium, get a nice view of the Brazos River usually with people fishing, and then get to see the brightly colored lights on the I 35 bridge. If you haven??t taking a stroll around the stadium after dark, I would encourage you to do so."
1643,Date of experience: October 2019,2-Dec-19,Big 12,Baylor,5,Football Fun,"It was halloween night and Baylor won in a dramatic way in the cold cold (for Texas) evening. The stadium is so well done, we experienced a military jet flyover prior to the game and we have experienced the Baylor Club on a previous trip. This is all First Class!"
1644,Date of experience: November 2019,5-Nov-19,Big 12,Baylor,5,Best stadium,May be best stadium in Big 12. Stadium is fairly new. Good views from all location on Baylor U campus
1645,Date of experience: October 2019,18-Oct-19,Big 12,Baylor,4,Nice stadium,The stadium is immense. It appears to be high tech as well. A real eye catcher in Waco due to its size.
1646,Date of experience: October 2019,14-Oct-19,Big 12,Baylor,5,Bear vs the world.,"We go to Bears footballs games all the time. This is a great stadium. Water view. Giant display screen, great sound system. Fans are great also. The food around the stadium is diverse and of good quality. Clean restrooms. Well run. The music played at games needs to be more in line with the big boys. They play a too much Hip Hop. The people buying the season tickets and paying the bills are not Hip Hop fans in general. So a bit more Rock music and other anthems used in ""Professional"" stadium settings will be welcomed. The funny music clips, etc. after penalties and such is delightful and fun. Overall great experiences there. The music does need a mature person helping on the deliberation about the choices.. Sure would be nice if adult beverages were served here as well. Kinda goes with football."
1647,Date of experience: October 2019,13-Oct-19,Big 12,Baylor,5,Very nice stadium; very clean and well maintained; great view even from up high,"The stadium and audio/video are excellent.  Even seats high up in the 300s are great.  The concessions are varied and much cheaper than usual at pro stadiums or movie theaters.  The only con is if you're sitting on the sun side of the stadium because it can be brutal, especially if you didn't know you needed to plan for that."
1648,Date of experience: September 2019,1-Oct-19,Big 12,Baylor,5,Great way to see the Bears!,This is a new state of the art stadium.  Great food selections including Chick-fil-a! Yeah!  Not a bad seat.  If  your going to an afternoon game 2:30 til.. choose 110 section or that side of the field as you are in the shade.
1659,Date of experience: September 2018,11-Mar-19,Big 12,Baylor,5,Nice Stadium,Very nice stadium. Very comfortable seats and very good view of the game. I like the fact that it is a smaller stadium. The traffic in and out of the stadium was not bad. Baylor does a good job and makes the game experience very enjoyable.
1661,Date of experience: October 2018,12-Feb-19,Big 12,Baylor,4,Beautiful stadium,McLane stadium is a beautiful stadium in Waco. Easy access into stadium. Make sure to carry clear purse. Good visibility of the field from most seats.
1662,Date of experience: January 2019,15-Jan-19,Big 12,Baylor,5,Baylor Club,"Wonderful experience in the Baylor Club, food was wonderful and customer service was wonderful! Look forward to coming back with family!"
1663,Date of experience: December 2018,3-Dec-18,Big 12,Baylor,4,Saturday afternoon December Texas High School Football Playoff Game,"The venue is small for a college venue (45K), but was certainly sufficient for a high school playoff game. Parking access into the stadium is easy but existing the parking lot for Northbound Interstate 35 traffic is frankly awful."
1664,Date of experience: September 2018,19-Nov-18,Big 12,Baylor,4,Nice venue with good overlook,"I liked my visit to McLane Stadium.  The facility is beautiful but inefficient.  Seats are not close to the field for a stadium this size (45,000).  I liked that many of the seats were in the shade because my visit was during an afternoon game.  The stadium is visible from the highway and across the Brazos River bridge.  There are lots of places to tailgate if you are a Baylor fan, but you will need to take the bus to/from downtown parking if you are a visitor."
1665,Date of experience: November 2018,18-Nov-18,Big 12,Baylor,4,TCU @ Baylor 11/17/18,"This is a beautiful place, with views to the south across the river onto the campus.  We found parking on north side in private lot for $25.  Food service was prompt and friendly.  Bathrooms clean and accessible, but signage was minimal.Flaw:  the exit ramps from north end are not adequate for people flow, and this was far from a full house.Dave@Texas"
1667,Date of experience: November 2018,6-Nov-18,Big 12,Baylor,5,Beautiful venue for college football,Fantastic new stadium with no bad seats!  Enjoy the game while looking across the Brazos River to the beautiful Baylor campus.
1668,Date of experience: November 2018,6-Nov-18,Big 12,Baylor,4,Nice Stadium,We sat on the Baylor side in the alumni section and the stadium seats were nice. We were there for an 11 a.m. game; would highly recommend bringing in sunscreen for early games because you are in the sun for the whole game on that side of the stadium at early kickoffs. Luckily I did or I know we would have been very sunburned!
1669,Date of experience: October 2018,6-Oct-18,Big 12,Baylor,5,Top notch experience-where is the beer?,"Loved tailGate/parking/campus...gorgeous.. clean , safe. Security easy, pedestrian bridges and Brazos river ..really nice setting. Crazy hot..tough to tail gate when you are soooo hot.

On par w pro stadium setting..really impressive Clean and loved opening prayer/ cheer leaders/spirit ..have been to MANY college football games all over country..really topNotch experience."
1670,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Oct-18,Big 12,Baylor,5,Baylor Game Day,"The stadium is well designed and modern. It is a small version of a pro-style stadium, with many amenities such as stores and concessions of various kinds. The food is a bit pricey, as are most stadium venues, but I have not had a bad food experience yet. The jumbo-tron is very nice, and the sound is good. Plus, the Baylor Club is a nice addition."
1671,Date of experience: August 2018,2-Oct-18,Big 12,Baylor,5,Beautiful stadium!,We didn't get to go inside but the outside is gorgeous! It has a great presence from the road -- you can't miss it.I would have liked the chance to go inside but there was a private event going on and only those doors were open.  Didn't want to be a party crasher!
1672,Date of experience: September 2018,26-Sep-18,Big 12,Baylor,5,Go Bears!,"We got tickets to a Baylor - Kansas game while we were in town.  So glad we did!  What a beautiful stadium.  We bought t-shirts, had a great lunch, and really enjoyed visiting with those sitting around us.  There is not a bad seat in the house!"
1673,Date of experience: September 2018,22-Sep-18,Big 12,Baylor,5,Its a nice stadium,"You can say what you want about the current situation, but the Stadium is second to none.  It might not be as big as others, but the view and amenities put it over the top."
1674,Date of experience: September 2018,22-Sep-18,Big 12,Baylor,4,Eat before you go...,"Eat before you go... Savor runs most of the food stations and the food is overpriced and tastes like cardboard.  Nothing for vegetarians (except, I guess, nasty nachos).  The stadium is beautiful and nicely laid out."
1675,Date of experience: August 2018,21-Sep-18,Big 12,Baylor,5,Beautiful stadium,"We visited the club house on the top and enjoyed a magnificent view.  I'm not a sports fan but enjoyed the comfortable seating, great view, and wonderful snacks of the club house."
1676,Date of experience: September 2018,19-Sep-18,Big 12,Baylor,5,"Brand new, modern stadium","A very enjoyable stadium, where every seat is a good seat! The megatron is a great option and replays are perfectly viewable on it."
1677,Date of experience: September 2018,15-Sep-18,Big 12,Baylor,5,Baylor Football,"The stadium was clean and well organized. All the staff were very friendly and helpful, look forward to visiting again."
1686,Date of experience: September 2017,5-Jun-18,Big 12,Baylor,5,OU vs. Baylor 2017,Enjoyed the game & really enjoyed the new stadium.  Really all new & very modern. Can't wait for my next visit
1696,Date of experience: November 2017,19-Mar-18,Big 12,Baylor,4,Good Football Stadium,Great stadium to see a Baylor football game. Good seats and nice places to eat. Sat on the Baylor side and was not in the sun. Much better side to sit on.
1699,Date of experience: November 2017,20-Nov-17,Big 12,Baylor,4,Great experience,"Although we are LSU and LaTech fans, we wanted to experience another great college football stadium. We were not disappointed. Stadium was very nice with plenty of concessions stands and bathrooms. The pregame was awesome! I loved seeing all the Senior students run out on the field to make the lane for the players to run out. Very family friendly atmosphere!"
1700,Date of experience: October 2017,20-Oct-17,Big 12,Baylor,5,Franklin Graham Crusade,We came to see Franklin Graham. Decision Texas Crusade. We attended a reception at the Baylor Club.  Very nice facility.
1703,Date of experience: October 2017,1-Oct-17,Big 12,Baylor,3,Just another stadium,"Mmmm did not find a significant meaning to this stadium,  competen to others in small towns,   Better to go to down town"
1704,Date of experience: September 2017,1-Oct-17,Big 12,Baylor,4,We started our river tour here,What a beautiful stadium in a water surrounded location. This is one heck of a place to tailgate on game day. Nothing like luxury on the party boats.
1708,Date of experience: August 2017,14-Aug-17,Big 12,Baylor,5,Baylor Club,We had a friend who arranged for lunch for us at the Baylor Club which gave us access to the stadium.  This was a special treat.  The food was good and the views were terrific.
1710,Date of experience: October 2016,7-Aug-17,Big 12,Baylor,5,Great Place to Watch Football,The stadium isn't large by major college football standards so all the seats are pretty good. The west side of the stadium is in the shade which makes a big difference in the early fall so try to get tickets there if possible.  They have lots of food options and two pretty good stores selling Baylor paraphernalia for the fans.  Sic 'em Bears!
1725,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Feb-17,Big 12,Baylor,4,Beautiful Stadium But Be Prepared For Sun!,"I have visited this stadium a couple of times now and it is gorgeous! However, please be prepared for the amount of time you will spend in the sun and/or heat! Bring a hat, sunscreen, a way to cover up if you burn easily, and drink plenty of water. For evening games, you are still in the sun for quite a while, especially if you are seated on the Baylor Line side. Even on really cool days, the sun is still pretty intense. For food items, best prices are at student-run concessions. Also, something I didn't know - you cannot bring a non-phone camera in the stadium with a telephoto lens.  Lenses over 3 inches long are not allowed as they are considered professional. Last, there is no on-site parking except for season ticket holders.  Your best and cheapest deal is to take the municipal park and ride at various locations in Waco. It's pretty fast and runs buses all during and after the game. Oh, one more thing - the displays of school spirit and pride are off the charts during the game. It is LOUD but super fun and exciting!"
1726,Date of experience: October 2016,13-Feb-17,Big 12,Baylor,5,Beautiful location on the river,The stadium still feels new after five years of use. The location on the Brazos is perfect. Plenty of good seats as well as a large screen monitor to watch live play and replays. Food courts are plentiful.
1727,Date of experience: August 2016,13-Feb-17,Big 12,Baylor,5,Very Nice,"I work in Waco a lot and I was able to watch the progress of the construction of this stadium, just of I-35, throughout the whole process. I was staying overnight at a hotel across the highway and decided to walk over one night. The grounds are beautiful and many local people come here to stroll. There are many walking trails around the stadium, which butts up right along the Brazos River. There is boat access to the stadium as well, where people come up and ""boatgate"" (like tailgating, but in a boat) before games. It reminds me a little of the Pittsburgh stadiums access along the riverfront. Really nice area and beautiful stadium."
1728,Date of experience: January 2017,29-Jan-17,Big 12,Baylor,5,"Huge, nice, new and spacious",Walked around the stadium in the offseason while we??re in town. There was lots of open area in front of the stadium and between the river and fountains in adjacent water.  Beautiful surrounding area and view of campus across the bridge.
1729,Date of experience: November 2016,4-Jan-17,Big 12,Baylor,5,College Football at it's Best,A beautiful new stadium with great views and food. Friendly and helpful staff were everywhere to assist first time visitors.  Rent a stadium seat if your are in the bleacher seat areas.
1730,Date of experience: December 2016,17-Dec-16,Big 12,Baylor,5,McLane Stadium,Had to stop and check this place out. Seen plenty of games here on TV but to see it in person is truly amazing! Huge stadium with a lake right next to it and a beautiful bridge crossing to the University of Baylor! Very impressed and glad to have stopped!
1731,Date of experience: November 2016,3-Dec-16,Big 12,Baylor,3,Not bad,Very pretty as you drive up.  Went for a high school football game and there is one way into the parking and one way out.  Same with the stadium.  Makes it very conjested.  Great video screen inside.
1732,Date of experience: November 2016,23-Nov-16,Big 12,Baylor,5,Go Bears!,Was able to attend the Baylor and Kansas State game. This was the first time visiting the stadium and was very impressed. The grounds and facilities are very clean. I ordered the Kettle Chip Nacho's with pork and all of the fixin's at the BBQ concession. These are a must when you attend a game. This is a perfect outing for both family and friends.
1733,Date of experience: November 2016,22-Nov-16,Big 12,Baylor,4,First trip to McClane Stadium. Nice!,"First trip to McClane Stadium for a Baylor game.  Very nice stadium for college football.  Note to Self: Wear a cap/hat! Wear sunscreen.  Not sure if it was by design, but the stadium almost reflects the sun's rays perfectly from overhead. It was a beautiful day when we went... just very bright and hot in the stands (went in November, mind you). The irony was it was also a cool day overall..  I think the high was 60... Go out on the concourse and the temperature changed... definitely needed a jacket then.  Go figure.  Can't imagine how it would feel in September....  Hope for a lot of night games then...  Anyway, the stadium is nice overall.  great atmosphere.  Lots of food choices, lots of facilities nearby.  Definitely would go back..."
1734,Date of experience: October 2016,14-Nov-16,Big 12,Baylor,5,Breathtaking!,Absolutely gorgeous stadium.  My husband I went to the stadium to see our grandson's high school band march at the stadium.  A true gem in Waco!
1735,Date of experience: October 2016,9-Nov-16,Big 12,Baylor,5,Amazing Baylor Venue - Must see if you visit Waco!,"Baylor really did a fabulous job in designing this sports venue.  WOW!  As a Baylor Bear, I'm proud to watch my team play here.  It's a comfortable, open and gorgeous stadium, and I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!"
1736,Date of experience: October 2016,21-Oct-16,Big 12,Baylor,5,"Awesome venue, awesome atmosphere and fantastic fans.","There isn't a bad seat in this new stadium.  The atmosphere in the stadium and outside is great.  The fans were extremely friendly, especially considering I was cheering for the visiting team.  I have been to many college stadiums and this was one of the great experiences for me.  Clean and numerous bathrooms, so no waiting in line.  The food was fairly priced.  I really don't have anything bad to say about this stadium or the Baylor Bears family.  I'd definitely attend a game or event here again."
1737,Date of experience: October 2016,19-Oct-16,Big 12,Baylor,5,Fabulous,"Watched Baylor dismantle Kansas at Homecoming. Phenomenal stadium-has everything, seating is perfect, food good, bathrooms big and clean-great place to watch a game"
1738,Date of experience: October 2016,16-Oct-16,Big 12,Baylor,4,Wonderful place,"Big, nice, clean, new, open. Lots of food options, lots of big bathrooms. Need more gates open, long lines to get in. Need more parking. Need more shade."
1739,Date of experience: September 2016,11-Oct-16,Big 12,Baylor,5,Spectacular,"Not a bad seat in the house, unless the game is early and you are starting into the sun. Game day is the Real Deal when it come to the College Experience."
1740,Date of experience: September 2016,5-Oct-16,Big 12,Baylor,4,Beautiful and Imposing Structure,"This stadium is imposing, large, and daring just like the Baylor Bears football team. It sits proudly just across the Brazos River from the main campus, a stone's throw from I-35; so easy access is guaranteed.My wife and I were in town on a weekend when Baylor was playing an away game, so we did not get into the stadium; however we did check out all the exterior venues and drove several times through the parking lot. I was truly impressed by the size and expanse of the stadium itself although it did appear to me that the parking areas are a bit on the small size.This attraction is worth 15 or 20 minutes of your time even if no game is in progress, so be sure to drive by and check it out.J. Randolph SmithMonroe, LA"
1741,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,Big 12,Baylor,5,Baylor vs SMU game,Check into finding somewhere to park. We had to walk 2.15 miles with two 8yr old kids. Talk about a mess. The stadium is very nice and we had great seats. Plenty of restrooms and plenty of concession stands. Don't sit near the big screen.  It is really loud. If it is a mid day game sit on the west side and you will be out of the sun. We were burned to a crisp after about 5 hours.
1742,Date of experience: September 2016,9-Sep-16,Big 12,Baylor,5,Love our Bears!,"McLane is a first class facility!  Love all the landscaped outdoor areas for tailgating and listening to bands.  The variety of concessions available is also extensive.  All the stadium staff were welcoming and extremely helpful.  The parking lot attendants were courteous, as well.  An overall wonderful experience while supporting our Bears!  Sic 'Em!"
1743,Date of experience: September 2016,8-Sep-16,Big 12,Baylor,1,High School Football,"This damn place SUCKS. I have now made 3 freaking trips to my car because they can't get their rules right. 1st no camera bag, 2nd no stadium seats, and now 3rd my lens is too long. I have a medical condition and don't get around easily. The staff was rude and one of them even mouthed off ""you don't look like you have a medical condition."" I didn't realize McLane Stadium had medical Dr's at their gates screening visitors. Will never come again nor recommend. Very disappointed. It was a freaking High school game not secret service stuff, get over yourself McLane Staff."
1744,Date of experience: August 2016,30-Aug-16,Big 12,Baylor,5,State of the Art,"How many college football stadiums boast that you can sailgate!!??  There is a beautiful marina immediately adjacent to the stadium on the Brazos River! The stadium is easily accessible from I35, and students can walk to it across a beautiful walking bridge from the main campus.  There is a large open space area for pre-game tailgating.  The stadium itself is totally state of the art. There is a lot of tradition and school spirit"
1745,Date of experience: November 2015,22-Aug-16,Big 12,Baylor,4,An Incredibly Beautiful Stadium,"We've been there for several Baylor football games as well as to the Baylor Club located at the stadium for dinner.  The stadium is extremely beautiful with red brick to fit into the older buildings at Baylor but with modern architecture.  The stadium is open in one side so you get a great view of the Brazos River and Baylor University.  There is a curved footbridge to allow people to walk from the campus over the Brazos to the stadium.  On the stadium side of the river you will pass the docks for boat tailgating and the areas for regular tailgating (on both sides of the river).  There is a bronze statue of Heisman Trophy winner Robert Griffin III at the entrance. There is commercial tailgating across the side street if you don't have anyone to tailgate with, as well as an area for kids.  The Baylor club requires a membership, but if you can get in, the food is excellent and it offers a complete bar.  The bar is closed during games.  You can have a drink or dinner and look over the stadium or the river and downtown Waco.  Parking for a game is prepaid only, so best to park downtown Waco and take a shuttle bus.  The stadium is large, so be prepared to do a lot of walking."
1749,Date of experience: September 2015,25-Jul-16,Big 12,Baylor,4,Waco's own Big 12 Stadium,"Opening last year and it is very nice.  No where near as big as it looks from the road, not a bad seat in the place, well maybe visitors side in the sun during August / September.  Great place to take in a game.  Great tailgate areas set up too.  Come down and walk around and experience GAME DAY in Waco Texas."
1750,Date of experience: November 2015,23-Jul-16,Big 12,Baylor,5,Beautiful stadium,McLane Stadium is a beautiful facility located in a great spot on campus.  The atmosphere is perfect for college football.
1756,Date of experience: December 2015,27-Jun-16,Big 12,Baylor,5,McLane Stadium is Awesome,One of the best stadiums to watch football and other events in the country.  No bad seats.  Lots of food options at events.  Friendly and helpful staff
1757,Date of experience: December 2015,1-Jun-16,Big 12,Baylor,5,"Great venue, lots of good seats, great tailgaiting/sailgating","The stadium is only two years old and in a great spot by I-35 and the Brazos River.  The seating is well designed to get the fans close to things and to have few bad seats.  The in-stadium wifi is cool with on demand video replays and stats.  The view of the river and campus from the upper seating is spectacular.  Get to the game hours ahead of the kickoff to enjoy tailgate parties or, if you're lucky, a sailgate party with a boat tied up in the lagoon by the stadium.  It's a great way to watch college football."
1758,Date of experience: November 2015,1-Jun-16,Big 12,Baylor,5,Great Venue,Great football stadium and club. Not one of the largest but one of the nicest. Tailgating at the games is fun.
1766,Date of experience: November 2015,9-Apr-16,Big 12,Baylor,5,Wow!,The experience at McLane Stadium was one I won't forget.  The stadium is beautiful.  The atmosphere with the views of the Brazos River make it unique.
1768,Date of experience: November 2015,27-Mar-16,Big 12,Baylor,5,Go Bears ??,"This stadium made me feel like I was in Texas Stadium with the roof open.  McLane Stadium has it all, from it's panoramic view of the Brazos and Baylor University to the exquisite sky boxes and the ?????????? Star Baylor Club. Don't miss the Baylor Bear's and their Nationally ranked team."
1770,Date of experience: October 2015,23-Mar-16,Big 12,Baylor,5,Lot of ways to enjoy this facility.,"Been to a game and had lunch and dinner in the Bear Club. Have driven and walked from downtown.  But my favorite is tailgating.The Brazos offers a stately approach (wake speed) from upstream and there are your everyday ski boats, pontoon boats, water taxis and some damn fine big boats that cruise down the river and into the bay where 18 slips sold immediately. Passengers can be dropped just steps from the stadium. But cruise around first, check out the restaurants that are on the river or tie up at the Franklin Bridge and run up to the food trucks a hundred yards away. Watch the crowds flood over the pedestrian bridge or see if anybody is at the law school. (They are.)And if you love it join the Bearmada. Just buy the official flag and strike your green and gold. On black, with crossed swords. Yarrrr.."
1771,Date of experience: November 2015,20-Mar-16,Big 12,Baylor,5,Baylor University,"We attended the Baylor / Oklahoma game at McLane Stadium.  The Stadium is awesome and in a very convenient location.  Unfortunately, the weather was horrible."
1772,Date of experience: December 2015,17-Mar-16,Big 12,Baylor,5,Home of the Bears!,"Baylor grad, season tickets, nothing more needs to be said...  McLane Stadium is a well-done stadium for sporting events.  It will be difficult for a non-season ticket holder to get tickets, but it is a great sporting event venue."
1775,Date of experience: January 2016,8-Feb-16,Big 12,Baylor,5,A Keeper,"The Bear Club is a great place for dinner, the stadium for a football is outstanding!  We attended football games there both college and high school, got a bad seat in the house.We've had been there several times,  staff pays attention to detail, there is a nice wine menu and a full bar.They have several special events, wine tasting, whiskey tastes things as well as brunch on weekends.Great place to go!"
1777,Date of experience: October 2015,1-Feb-16,Big 12,Baylor,5,One of the best college football experiences anywhere,Not the biggest....by design.  It is the BEST....by design.  Not a bad seat in the house.  Tailgating on the grounds and sailgating on the river.  Call ahead and reserve a full tour.  State of the Art (Briles)...no pun intended.
1778,Date of experience: December 2015,31-Jan-16,Big 12,Baylor,5,Jewel of the Brazos!,Baylor did an amazing job on this athletic facility. Great leg room with all of the seats! Excellent video and sound system as well as wifi. Convenient concessions and 'facilities'. Game day at McLane is special with tail and sail gating on the Brazos. A facility for both Waco and Baylor to be proud of.
1779,Date of experience: November 2015,30-Jan-16,Big 12,Baylor,5,Great Place for Football or Music,Not a bad seat in the house and many seats have a river view.

1780,Date of experience: December 2015,19-Jan-16,Big 12,Baylor,5,More than a stadium,The football stadium is state of the art. The restaurant and facilities are amazing. I was invited as a guest and was completely impressed. Can't wait to go back.
1781,Date of experience: November 2015,14-Jan-16,Big 12,Baylor,4,Big stadium,The stadium is very big and the jumbo trons makes it easier to see what is going on on the field.  The concession stand prices are high so take plenty of spending money.
1783,Date of experience: September 2015,2-Jan-16,Big 12,Baylor,5,Best stadium around,Very impressive building and loved the cobble stones with the names of former and current BU students. Spectacular especially during game days!
1785,Date of experience: December 2015,14-Dec-15,Big 12,Baylor,4,great place to watch a game,A family atmosphere for sure!  Every seat is a good seat here--even way up high.  Great sound system and video screen.
1786,Date of experience: November 2015,11-Dec-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,Beautiful Stadium,"I was here for my son's playoff game, the University didnt spare any expense building this stadium. Not as big as most college stadiums but that is fine with me, not a bad seat in the stadium and right near the interstate so you can miss it when your driving thru Waco. Next year I will go back for a Baylor game to see the full experience."
1787,Date of experience: December 2015,6-Dec-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,Amazing Experience,"I really enjoyed myself at this stadium. It was my first time going and I was very impressed. It is on the little on the small side for how many fans Baylor has, but that's ok. They offer sailgaiting on the marina as well. The bathrooms were clean and cool, not hot like at most stadiums. There were plenty of options for concessions and the lines were fast. The food is a little pricey, but that's expected from a top of the line facility."
1788,Date of experience: December 2015,6-Dec-15,Big 12,Baylor,4,Beautiful Stadium,"First visit to stadium yesterday for the Texas v Baylor game. Parking was very easy to find. Plenty of space around the stadium. Concessions very well organized, access to the stadium easy with great security on the grounds. Does not seem to be one bad seat in the whole place. Only downside to the day was Baylor losing to Texas (amazing given how bad Texas is playing)."
1789,Date of experience: October 2015,2-Dec-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,Field of Dreams,"If you grew up in Waco 8 blocks from Floyd Casey Stadium you will be amazed that the new stadium as incredible as it is in every way. I have to pinch myself to believe it is REALLY WACO! I am so proud of the final look, feel and setting! Way to Go!"
1790,Date of experience: October 2015,17-Nov-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,Gorgeous!,"This is one of the best stadiums in the US for sure. Right on the river gives opportunity for sailgating, the weather is great, and the entire stadium is beautiful."
1791,Date of experience: November 2015,16-Nov-15,Big 12,Baylor,4,"Awesome venue for college football game, but....","Bring ear plugs.  Baylor enjoyed playing a seemingly endless medley of rap music for 3rd downs, 4th downs, and pretty much any time the ball wasn't snapped.  Terrific venue, horrible game watching experience.  The Baylor band got to play at halftime, and the remainder of the game I was cringing to the latest Lil Wayne idiocy at top volume.  I expected more taste from the program."
1792,Date of experience: November 2015,16-Nov-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,A feast for athletic loving eyes...,"This multimillion dollar stadium has just about everything a football fan could want.  You can tailgate, you can 'sailgate'.  This Baylor University gem has plenty of seating.  Seats are fairly easy to access, and many of the seats are covered in case of inclement weather.  Food is offered - lots of different fare compared to typical stadium food.  There are handicap seats, a nursing mommies area, plenty of spaces to mingle before, during, and after the game."
1793,Date of experience: September 2015,12-Nov-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,Best stadium in US,"Mclane stadium is on the banks of the Brazos. Not only is there tailgating - they also have sailgating. The stadium is modern, easily accessible - big variety of food at concessions, and GREAT views from any seat in the house. Its the best football stadium I have ever been to"
1794,Date of experience: October 2015,5-Nov-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,Baylor vs. West Virginia,McLane stadium is amazing.  If you're ever going through waco or staying in Waco this is a must see.  Football games are incredible.  The atmosphere is intense and really fun.
1795,Date of experience: October 2015,26-Oct-15,Big 12,Baylor,4,Wow! Great place to watch a game!,"This stadium is so pretty as you walk over the bridge toward it.  Additionally, it's big, but not too big, so it's easy to navigate and you feel on top of the action."
1796,Date of experience: October 2015,26-Oct-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,What Baylor Money can Buy,"It's about time, Baylor invest in a stadium worth the schools reputation. Truly beautiful, taking in the benefits of a great location and involving the best the city has to offer. Come and relax whether there is football or not."
1797,Date of experience: October 2015,24-Oct-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,Stunning New Stadium on the Brazos River,"First time here as daughter is a newly admitted freshman here at Baylor.  Exceptional stadium in terms of design, field vantage from just about all sides (save the grass in front of the goal posts but that's true of any stadium.  Spotlessly clean.  A reasonable selection of food and beverages at reasonable prices.  Parking is a bit challenging so I recommend parking off sight and taking the buses - MUCH easier.  Perhaps my only complaint is that in the heat of early fall here in Texas they could - and should - have designed more overhead coverage.  If you're on the western side of the stadium, better put on a LOT of sunscreen and wear a hat."
1798,Date of experience: October 2015,23-Oct-15,Big 12,Baylor,4,Nice new stadium but hot,"We go to a lot of college football games. This is a nice stadium and an improvement over their old one. The sun was unbearable in our visitors seats in the end zone. We had to go into the walkway under the seating halfway through to watch the game. We are from Louisiana, so we can handle the heat, and it was in October, but it was miserable. It is laid out a little awkwardly, but the views of the surroundings from the seats are beautiful. You can tell they focus more on academics than sports, the tailgaiting was near non-existant. All-in-all, it is a nice stadium and I am proud for them to habe it."
1799,Date of experience: October 2015,19-Oct-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,"Wow, Football on the Brazos!","Our daughter is a Baylor student and while we have toured McLane, this was our first time to experience a football game at Baylor.  Amazing!  We got tickets through TicketCity (which by the was was a fabulous experience, though not a cheap venue) and this was such a fun day!  If you do not have season tickets that include parking, I would suggest reading online about parking.  We went ahead and bought a parking pass through TicketCity and it was really easy.  There was even a shuttle from our parking garage, though we chose to walk across campus since it was a beautiful day.I would highly suggest going a couple of hours early and enjoying all the festivities of the day.  Even if you are not part of a tailgate/sailgate group, there is a lot to see and do.  Try touchdown alley where they have brought in a large area of turf from the old stadium and there are vendors of all types giving things away and selling food/drink.  Then, walk the bridge over to the RG3 statue and just enjoy the views.  Get there early enough to see the Golden Wave band enter the stadium and then the Baylor Line.  The stadium is extremely clean and the lines for food/drink did not seem long.  Not that McLane has similar policies to other stadiums that you cannot take in large bags.  If you want to take an empty water bottle, there are many fountains around to fill up and we saw lots of parents doing this with children.  It was a warm, sunny day last weekend and be sure to bring a hat and sunscreen. You will need it in most sections.And, at night, be sure to go see the lights on the I-35 bridge over the Brazos.  They use LEDs to light up green and gold.  Really neat!"
1800,Date of experience: September 2015,14-Oct-15,Big 12,Baylor,4,First Class Division I FB Stadium,"Great Facility, not a bad seat ( except the berm, not tried it). Architecturally pleasing. Small capacity by D-I standards -- around 45,000 seats. By comparison UT and Oklahoma hold twice as many folks. Baylor Admin logic was to keep it limited to always sell out seat...so far working with a winning product on the field. Best bet is to park downtown on Austin Ave and take one of the constant free Transit Buses to the stadium. They are easy to find, and easy to get out. Bonus is good sit down food before games with transit time to stadium of approx 20 minutes. Crowd well behaved ( hey they are Bapt for the most part). Stadium Food -- high cost for average food at best. Baylor gets an ""A"" grade, and I'm an Aggie ( with a Bear of a wife)!"
1803,Date of experience: September 2015,26-Sep-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,Hot Weather Tips,"The stadium is great and truly not a bad seat.  I just took my kids to a 2:00 pm game and thought I'd give a few tips to those of you who haven't been to the stadium during the heat of the day.* Ticket Selection:  Shade is vital - Sections 1-11 are the first to have shade, but not until 3 or 4 pm.  Your best bet is to sit high in your section of choice.  We were in Section 313 Row 1 and roasted until around 4:30 pm.  Higher seats = more shade and more breeze.  Sections 17-30 cleared out at half time* Wear sunscreen - they have some for sale for $4 for a travel size but sold out at several places in the stadium* Wear a hat, bring a bandana or spirit towel to shade yourself* Bring a water bottle - you can bring in an empty bottle and fill from the water fountain* Be prepared to walk* Rent a seat cushion with back for $10 - unless your bleacher seat has them installed or you don't mind bleacher seating* Get to the stadium at least 20 minutes before start time to see the Baylor Line rush the field and the team introduced - great college tradition"
1804,Date of experience: September 2015,22-Sep-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,BAYLOR - MacLane Stadium is state of the art.,"While I have been in almost every SEC stadium, and many others around the country, MacClane Stadium is a ground stadium, not a retrofit like so many others. The differences are obvious. If you can pull yourself away from the extremely nice and friendly well laid out  Tailgating or as a bonus Sail-gating on Lake Brazos, you may eventually enter the stadium. Tradition meets Technology and lessons learned in the Stadium building business. Off course the upper decks on East and Southeast corners are sun filled until late in the afternoon or better evening games. The heat and the ambiance of the tailgating opportunities seem to have the stadium fill slowly. But once there, The Baylor Golden Wave Band and all that is football including the special Baylor Line make it a great place for top tier NCFA action.  Signage is good, food is better than most stadiums, and all is surprisingly clean, spanking new. This will be a great place to build tradition, get there early in 2015. BAYLOR is doing great."
1805,Date of experience: September 2015,13-Sep-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,Baylor Football!,"My cousin and I met in Waco last year for the BU/TCU game (WOW) and this year for BU (my school) v. Lamar (his school.)  What a great adventure both years!  The atmosphere around McLane Stadium is electric, but nothing compared to attennding the game itself!  Every seat offers a terrific view - both years we were in the ""nose-bleed"" section, albeit near or on the 50-yard line.  The scoreboard is super and really adds to the experience.  Can't wait 'til next year!  Sic ""Em Bears!"
1807,Date of experience: September 2015,9-Sep-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,Waco's Crown Jewel,"McLane Stadium quickly has become Waco's crown jewel. Beautifully situated on the Brazos River, it is known for great sight lines, an awesome video display and both land- and water-based tailgating (sailgating). That the Baylor Bears play one of the most exciting brands of football in the USA is a bonus. It is one of the premier college football venues in America."
1808,Date of experience: December 2014,9-Sep-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,Beautiful venue!,We have season tickets to Baylor football. This is such a great stadium.....beautiful inside and the views outside are even better.  The Pedestrian bridge over the Brazos River gives an amazing view as you walk across to the stadium. Great tailgating and sailgating too! One of a kind!
1809,Date of experience: August 2015,8-Sep-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,Awesome!,"This is an awesome place to visit. It is called ""The stadium that RG III built."" I guess that alumni made large donations after RG III won the Heisman trophy. Too bad that things aren't working out very well for him on the Washington Redskins."
1810,Date of experience: October 2014,2-Sep-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,First time to stadium,"We went last season and had such a good time.  Parking wasn't as bad as I had thought it might be.  Used the garage on campus and caught a shuttle.  Once at the stadium I was amazed at the view.  Don't think you will find a bad seat in the house.  It's nice too, that the food area has a good view of the field too.  If you are on the visitors side, bring a hat and sunscreen."
1811,Date of experience: August 2015,22-Aug-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,Beautiful Architecture,What a beautiful stadium.  Home of the Baylor Bears!  This place in incredible just off of I-35 at Baylor University.
1812,Date of experience: August 2015,17-Aug-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,Simply Awesome,"Simply put the nicest D-1 football stadium I have ever visited. Not the largest, but per square foot the classiest for sure. Yes, I have been to many others too including U of M's big house etc..etc..Really not a bad seat in the house to take in a game. Of course because it's Baylor, everything is first class! Beautiful setting right on the river overlooking campus. The grounds around the stadium are landscaped nicely as well. Dining at the Stadium Club inside is spectacular as well. All around it's impressive and for a private school even more impressive that this was built with significant private donor funding."
1813,Date of experience: August 2015,16-Aug-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,Well designed stadium!,"Great stadium - well designed and a huge improvement over Floyd Casey as far as amenities.  Floyd Casey Stadium was a part of our history, but the new stadium is excellent!"
1816,Date of experience: November 2014,26-Jul-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,BU is for Brilliant Upgrade,"The Case, bless her heart, could make a crowd of 15,000 feel like 100,000.  the concourse was maybe 3 feet wide, and there were 7 total urinals.  McLane on the other hand, is a gem that can be compared favorably to any stadium in the country."
1823,Date of experience: December 2014,3-Jul-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,Best Football venue,"It helps that I love Baylor, but this venue is incredible. The parking is across the river and the dedicated walking bridge just adds to the game day experience. Once inside, all the hype you may have heard pales in comparison to actually seeing it. No bad seats and lots going on to keep you involved. All this and I didn't mention it has its own marina."
1824,Date of experience: November 2014,30-Jun-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,Baylor Bears home is great!,Baylor really outdid itself when building the new home for the Baylor Bears.  There is WIFI throughout and no columns so if you are walking around you can see the game from anywhere.  Great stadium.
1825,Date of experience: October 2014,30-Jun-15,Big 12,Baylor,4,Great Stadium,Seats were expensive.  Distant parking unless you pay for close covered parking. Needed to rent a seat cushion. I don't think they let you bring your own.
1831,Date of experience: November 2014,19-May-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,Fabulous,This is the most beautiful open air stadium I have been to.  The surroundings are Texas at it's best.
1833,Date of experience: November 2014,17-May-15,Big 12,Baylor,2,"It looks great on the outside, but looks like an average stadium on the inside","It looks great on the outside, but looks like an average stadium on the inside.....it's okIt seems like the most beneficial thing for the stadium is it's location."
1834,Date of experience: December 2014,5-May-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,Good upgrade,"Saw my first game in the new stadium.  Much better than the old ""Case"".  Very convient walk from campus as opposed to a bus ride to the old stadium.  Excellent upgrade on seating and much better eating venues - prices are still high.  Great upgrade that is well deserved."
1837,Date of experience: November 2014,22-Apr-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,Best of the Best,"This new stadium has it all. Its located on the Brazos River - sailgating in addition to tailgating. Incredible atmosphere and venue. plenty of bathrooms, concessions so it doesnt feel crowded. berm seating available - very reasonable. Do not miss it if you have the opportunity"
1841,Date of experience: November 2014,17-Mar-15,Big 12,Baylor,4,Great place for Football,"The football is great, But the food is overpriced at the games.  They have an awful 'vegetarian chipotle sausage dog' - and that's it if you don't eat meat.  The Baylor club is a nice place for a party, but they also have a blind spot when it comes to vegetarians."
1843,Date of experience: January 2015,3-Mar-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,State of the art!,"It was pretty secured, but l found an open door, leading to an escalator, leading to the football stadium. It was very impressive! First time site - charging stations for smart phones."
1844,Date of experience: December 2014,27-Feb-15,Big 12,Baylor,4,Baylor's Crowning Jewel on the Brazos,"A nice new edition to the Baylor campus. Tailgaiting is finally a thing and even better, Sailgating. The marina come right up to the stadium offering a unique game day experience."
1845,Date of experience: October 2014,25-Feb-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,Absolutely Fantastic Stadium,"Seats are great, great views from every seat, great large screen for replays, acoustics great--can hear everything--but still have a conversation with your family and friends. Sic'Em Bears--you did a great job with your new stadium, we've already bought season tickets for next years season"
1846,Date of experience: September 2014,11-Feb-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,Stadium,"Fantastic. Cons. None.  Any team would be proud to play in this stadium. Lots of parking, shuttle truck for fans.plenty of food"
1849,Date of experience: December 2014,4-Feb-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,"Beautiful stadium, not a bad seat in the house!","We have been there a couple of times, it is layed out so nicely that even with my sore knee it was easy to get in and out of, lots of venues, restrooms handly. All the views are good views. Beautiful stadium!!"
1850,Date of experience: November 2014,21-Jan-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,Amazing,"The stadium is unbelievable. Without a doubt, this is the best football stadium in the country. Pictures do not do it justice. One must be there to appreciate it."
1851,Date of experience: November 2014,11-Jan-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,The Jewel of the Brazos!,"I'm biased but you won't find a better, more lavishly equipped stadium in the world. The tailgating areas are well laid out, the river and bridges offer a great sailgating atmosphere, and the seating is just perfect. It's hard to find any flaws in the 1st year of being open. Most notable area for improvement is service and speed in concessions. Must see for lovers of college football!"
1852,Date of experience: November 2014,6-Jan-15,Big 12,Baylor,5,Best stadium on the planet,"Brand new, state of the art and gorgeous.  Two great features - HD jumbotron in the endzone, and an interior concourse like in a professional baseball stadium.  Easy parking and shuttle from downtown and some of the best tailgating in the country."
1854,Date of experience: December 2014,15-Dec-14,Big 12,Baylor,5,What a place!!,This is an incredible stadium - Baylor and Waco should be very proud of it! Top notch stadium for a top notch school!
1855,Date of experience: December 2014,10-Dec-14,Big 12,Baylor,5,Best Stadium in the U.S.!!!,"McLane Stadium is absolutely AMAZING! It is not only beautiful in itself, the setting is wonderful. Walking across the Brazos to get to the game... too cool. Next time I want to borrow or rent a boat to ""sailgate."" We walked around the whole stadium and there does not appear to be a bad seat in the house. What a wonderful addition to Baylor University!! We drove from Cincinnati to experience the new stadium and it was well worth the 15.5 hr drive!!"
1856,Date of experience: December 2014,9-Dec-14,Big 12,Baylor,5,Great place to catch a game.,This was by far one of the best places I have been to watch a football game.  As a visiting fan the atmosphere was excellent and better then our favorite teams home games.  The stadium does a  great job of creating an entertaining event.  Our seats were 23 rows up and were a mere 30 seconds or less to the nearest restroom or concessions.  The entry and exit for the stadium were easy.  The setting around the stadium was neat being by the river and on the edge of campus with walking bridge.  We utilized the cities FREE transportation to and from the stadium by parking at 5th and Austin for FREE and riding the buses provided.  It was fast to the stadium and even after the game with a long the line it moved fast as they had plenty of buses running.  Very much enjoyed the whole visit and look forward to another one sometime with hopefully a victory for our team and not the home team.
1857,Date of experience: November 2014,9-Dec-14,Big 12,Baylor,5,Homecoming Weekend,"One of the New attractions for the Baylor Bears ,since RG III left.Come to Baylor Bears and enjoy a game, Pigskin Revue and Pep Rally / Bonfire.Parent oriented for the new generations to enroll in a Christian School."
1858,Date of experience: November 2014,2-Dec-14,Big 12,Baylor,5,Incredible New College Football Venue,"We attended the Baylor - Kansas football game on Nov 1, 2014.  The new stadium is a wonderful place to view a college game.  The setting along Lake Brazos is unique and is accessible via a stylistic pedestrian bridge from the campus."
1859,Date of experience: November 2014,2-Dec-14,Big 12,Baylor,4,Great Game Venue,"Great Venue, friendly and courteous staff.  Parking was efficient, yet exiting to the stadium a bit challenging.  Great view of the field, scoreboard, bands and 'video replay'.  Overall, great experience."
1860,Date of experience: November 2014,25-Nov-14,Big 12,Baylor,5,Baylor did it right!,"The new stadium is wonderful!  Finally, a facility on campus, easy to get to, and with lots of amenities--including free WiFi."
1862,Date of experience: November 2014,17-Nov-14,Big 12,Baylor,4,Nice!!,The new stadium is very nice.  we were there for a High School football playoff game and it was very comfortable.   Get there early for big games because the parking is limited.   There are shuttles from different places downtown.
1863,Date of experience: October 2014,16-Nov-14,Big 12,Baylor,5,Awesome game!,"LOVE the new stadium! Wonderful facility. Comfortable, easy to manage. Plenty of food options. Great views. LOVE LOVE LOVEit!"
1864,Date of experience: November 2014,8-Nov-14,Big 12,Baylor,5,The new highlight of Baylor University,"This is one of the most scenic sports stadiums I have ever been in! I've witnessed the construction over the past 2 years and was impressed by the final outcome. Baylor has created a visual masterpiece along the Brazos river and has expertly designed the Stadium grounds to integrate into existing campus and make it accessible to both students and visitors.We parked on Bayor's campus and walked over with the crowd of students and parents. As you near McLane stadium the lawns are sectioned off for tailgating. So as you begin to near the stadium your excitement builds as the energy is built up with passionate fans sporting Baylor gear and filling the air with the irrestistable smells of Texas BBQ. Your entry to the actual stadium grounds is marked by crossing the Brazos on the expansive new pedestrian bridge. As you walk across the stadium comes into full view and you see the expanse of tailgaters surrounding the stadium and extending far beyond.Inside the stadium there are plenty of food options, and much to my delight offered more than just the usual burgers/hotdogs/pizza. My wife and I split a BBQ brisket sandwich that was good enough to be mentioned in a review!I absolutely loved the new stadium and look forward to watching the Baylor Bears rack up many more victories in it in the years to come."
1865,Date of experience: November 2014,3-Nov-14,Big 12,Baylor,5,Amazing new venue,"I have sat in almost every section for a game (or portion of it). It is a great college venue.  If you are going, allow at least two hours to explore the tailgate scene."
1866,Date of experience: October 2014,15-Oct-14,Big 12,Baylor,5,Jewel in the Big 12 Crown,This stadium is exactly what Waco needed to dress up the place.  Watching Baylor football on a Fall Saturday is magical in thins new state-of the-art stadium.  Sic 'em Bears!!!
1867,Date of experience: October 2014,15-Oct-14,Big 12,Baylor,5,MUST SEE IN WACO!,"This is the grand attraction of Waco.  Attending a game here is a real experience to document on your Facebook page.  As you approach the stadium you will see a canal with boats right up close decorated in Baylor Bear fashion.  The bridges offer access to various events staged on islands, greek tailgating, and passageway over the Brazos River to Baylor University grounds.  There is a wi-fi system throughout and plenty of food inside and outside the facility.  No alcohol on the premises, but freely flowing at the Georges Tent to the North (or in friendly vehicles on the parking lot).  Watching the Baylor students storm the field before each game, let by Pres Ken Starr is a sight you will not forget!"
1868,Date of experience: October 2014,14-Oct-14,Big 12,Baylor,5,New Baylor Stadium,"Amazing new facility. Difficult parking. Inside stadium has roomy concourse, choice of concessions, bathrooms appropriate for crowd, timely ingress and egress."
1869,Date of experience: October 2014,12-Oct-14,Big 12,Baylor,5,Beautiful stadium,"My wife (a Baylor) graduate) and I (a TCU alum) attended McLane Stadium with family for the first time in October 2014 for the epic 61-58 game, which Baylor unfortunately won. It's a beautiful stadium in a gorgeous setting, on the banks of the Brazos River. The atmosphere was electric, and our upper deck seats were excellent allowing us to see the entire field clearly. It was easy to get in and out of the stadium, despite the sellout crowd. We parked in downtown Waco and took a shuttle bus to the stadium, but the buses were efficient, even after the game. Overall, the game-day experience is fantastic. But get there early."
1870,Date of experience: September 2014,28-Sep-14,Big 12,Baylor,5,New Baylor Stadium sets the standard!,"This new college stadium rivals or surpasses many pro ball locations for size.  Free wifi, good food, every seat affords a great view.  Very much enjoyed the game.  There is no beer (Its a Baptist school) but Georges has some beer tents across the street, for before and after."
1871,Date of experience: September 2014,21-Sep-14,Big 12,Baylor,5,Awesome Stadium ! ! !,There is absolutely NOTHING to dislike and EVERYTHING to like.  Brand new stadium to match the best Big12 Team.
1872,Date of experience: September 2014,16-Sep-14,Big 12,Baylor,5,Takes Your Breath Away,"McLane stadium is everything that USA Today, ESPN, Sports Illustrated, et al say it is.  It is certainly not the largest in college football, but it has ""bells and whistles"" that no one else has, or likely has even thought of - personal replays on your iPhone, and ""sail gating"" are just a couple.  Just go."
1873,Date of experience: September 2014,15-Sep-14,Big 12,Baylor,5,Everything and More!,"Everything you have been hearing and reading is true!  The setting on the river is magnificent.  With both the north and south end open, a breeze blows through the stadium even on the inaugural eve when it was 97 degrees!  There does not seem to be a bad seat in the house.  The concourses are extremely wide, the food vendors are not only excellent but the prices are fair.  How refreshing it that.  (Except for a $5 bottle of water).  The bridge across the Brazos gives you an amazing view.  Parking is convenient and close.It reminds us of a smaller version of Jerry's World.  The Bears waited a long time for this and it certainly does not disappoint!  If you don't have season tickets, you may never get a ticket.  So, get in line for them next year as you need to be a part of this!""Sic 'em Bears"" says the Longhorn!"
1874,Date of experience: August 2014,8-Sep-14,Big 12,Baylor,5,Excellent venue to watch a game,"I've been to a lot of stadiums - Texas' DKR Memorial in Austin, TCU's Amon Carter in Fort Worth, A&M's Kyle Field in College Station, University of Phoenix in Glendale, AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Cowboys Stadium in Irving, the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, and compared to those McLane has all the good things with none of the bad. Though it doesn't have a removable top or a sliding field it has a great view outside the stadium and many of the seats benefit from cover of an upper deck or the unique canopy that covers a good portion of the upper deck which helps from the weather. Views from most anywhere are fantastic and close to the field and the jumbotron is huge and crystal clear HD. Like Amon Carter & Kyle Field the concessions are plentiful and easy to access while not missing out on the game time action.  The food is decent and priced about what you would expect from other similar venues.  Restrooms are plentiful and clean (its new so that's a given).  Wifi is better than most any other collegiate stadium thanks to a $2M investment in technology and includes an in-stadium app that allows you to see replays, look for particular concessions, elevators, etc. It is easy to get in and out of though parking requires a bit of a walk unless you take a shuttle from downtown or are lucky enough to have one of the ~2500 reserved spaces at the stadium.  Tailgating, which is relatively new to Baylor has taken hold in a big way and is spread out not just around the stadium but in other locals around the campus and Waco.  Add to this the ability to boat to the stadium and you have one of the most unique environments in all of sports.  Like many other storied football programs in the country, Baylor now has a stadium worth traveling to to see a game."
1880,Date of experience: September 2022,3-Oct-22,Big 12,BYU,5,Have a Cougartail,LES was a pretty cool place to see a football game.  The fans are generally friendly and BYU does a good job with concessions.  They have refillable sodas and a donut on steroids called a Cougartail that I highly recommend
1881,Date of experience: October 2021,12-Jul-22,Big 12,BYU,5,GO COUGS,Mountain view is breathtaking. Fans are hyped. Get a cougar tail (footlong maple bar). You'll be glad you came unless you're a Utah fan.
1883,Date of experience: October 2020,1-Nov-20,Big 12,BYU,4,Beautiful stadium experience!,"I was extremely impressed with this stadium.  The constant action of the announcer along with the fans made for a great experience despite my team's loss.  The stands, restrooms, and seats were extremely clean and everyone followed COVID19 precautions ""religiously"" (no pun intended -- seriously) and maybe to a 'fault'.  We were not allowed to sit with our party even though we had been with them for the entire weekend just because our seats were not right next to them despite there being plenty of seating.  However, this did not distract too much from the experience.  The stadium is actually ""pretty"" or ""beautiful"" could be a better word.  It is set at the base of the mountains just south of Salt Lake City and coming out of Deer Valley/Park City area so it makes for GREAT pictures!  Any seat has a great view and it has two large jumbo-trons for watching the game and replays.  While these are NOT as big as some Power 5 stadiums -- they are quite large."
1884,Date of experience: October 2019,22-Oct-19,Big 12,BYU,3,Rain Rain Go Away!,This stadium is older and there is not a single place to get out of the rain unless you go under the stadium. The walkways were not made to drain so you have to walk through at least 6 inches of water to get in or out of the stadium. The fans were nice but my feet were soaked the entire game. On a beautiful fall day I am sure the stadium is wonderful.
1890,Date of experience: November 2018,13-Feb-19,Big 12,BYU,5,My happy place!,"LES is the home of the Brigham Young Univeristy Cougars.  I have been a season ticket holder for football for several decades now.  Beautiful views of the mountains and a fun, family friendly atmosphere."
1891,Date of experience: December 2018,26-Dec-18,Big 12,BYU,5,Lavell Edwards Stadium is amazing,"This is a great stadium and home of the Brigham Young Cougars where many NFL quarterbacks have honed their skills including Steve Young, Jim McMahon, Gifford Nielson, Marc Wilson and many others giving the Cougars the nickname of the ""Quarterback Factory.""  Very easy parking, clean and comfortable and lots of great fans."
1894,Date of experience: November 2017,4-Mar-18,Big 12,BYU,5,A Wonderful Variety of Food Vendors,"Going to a Cougar Game has become a family tradition, and with each year this stadium surprises us with the variety of food venders. We do love the traditional Cougar Tails, brownies, and ice cream, but have ventured into the world of French, Irish, Australian, and even middle Eastern Cuisine. Who would have thought?! The stadium itself is in a great location and offers many parking options. The staff is always happy to help and they keep the place super clean (including the bathrooms). It is one of the most family friendly stadiums I have ever been to which is very encouraging if you have children. In fact, our children look forward to our Fall Family Football games every year now."
1896,Date of experience: September 2017,7-Dec-17,Big 12,BYU,4,Nice Place,This is a large and impressive stadium. In general the staff we have encountered have been helpful. The views toward the mountains from within the stadium are beautiful.
1897,Date of experience: October 2017,7-Oct-17,Big 12,BYU,5,Excellent Family NCAA Football Experience,"No matter where you go, sports are mixed with alcohol most of the time.  This can get ugly.  If you are from the northwest, you have seen it happen most likely (Pullman, Corvallis, Boise, etc).  Covering your kids ears while the fan behind you drops F bombs and you can feel the saliva spray from his mouth glistening over you as he yells... not here in Provo.  No alcohol!  Not only do we get to enjoy games here, our kids do too!  Absolutely without a DOUBT THEEEE most family friendly college football stadium in the country.  Also, one of the biggest in the west.  Twice the size of Boise??s Albertsons stadium for example."
1898,Date of experience: August 2017,18-Sep-17,Big 12,BYU,5,Love BYU Football,"Well, I don't love the team this year, but the Marching Band is incredible.  Plenty of restrooms and food vendors.  Drinking fountains are all over for water bottle filling."
1899,Date of experience: September 2017,14-Sep-17,Big 12,BYU,5,Exciting place to watch a football game,"The level of excitement and energy in the stadium makes it a fun time. There are 2 great replay screens, one for each end zone. There are a lot of food choices, some of them are healthy. You can bring in an empty water bottle to refill so you don't have to get in line just to buy water. People are friendly and considerate. Parking is like most football stadiums and you have to walk a bit if you are not a member of the Cougar Club. Most of the lots are for members. There is quite a bit of handicapped seating and the women's restrooms are large on the two sides. Tickets are kind of expensive, but check the resale sites to hopefully spend less."
1900,Date of experience: October 2016,17-Apr-17,Big 12,BYU,5,My stadium,I have been to dozens of stadiums all over the country but none are better than LES! This is my place and a beautiful backdrop for a BYU game!
1901,Date of experience: September 2016,11-Apr-17,Big 12,BYU,5,Great place to watch a football game!,If you are a fan of College football and especially the BYU Cougars this is a must visit.  Crowds are loud.  Sitting at the base of the mountains this stadium is also a scenic place to watch a game.  Ticket prices are reasonable and there are some really good food vendors in the stadium.
1902,Date of experience: September 2019,23-Nov-19,Big 12,Cincinnati,5,Surprisingly good college football game day atmosphere,"I had seen this stadium several times, but never been here during a college football game. It was a more enjoyable game day atmosphere than expected. I was at the game as a fan of the opposing team, but had not issues or any harassment dealt toward me."
1903,Date of experience: November 2019,17-Nov-19,Big 12,Cincinnati,5,Nippert is of the oldeset and gest stadiums in the NCAA,"Humble attitude, Great aminities, convienient restrooms, family friendly changing rooms, great consessesions and an all American Concessions stands have great mets, hotdogs and more."
1904,Date of experience: December 2018,18-Jul-19,Big 12,Cincinnati,5,Great Place!,"excellent place to watch games, love the ease of getting in and out, very well laid out, always enjoyed coming here, especially for High school games."
1908,Date of experience: November 2018,23-Nov-18,Big 12,Cincinnati,4,"Small, old stadium but many upgrades","Hadn't been to Nippert in at least fifteen years, must admit at being pleasantly surprised at all the upgrades.  UC doesn't draw all that well for football, maybe 20000 today for last game of the regular season.  Still impressed by the fans that did go, very enthusiastic crowd.  Lots of food and drink options from multiple concession stands and food kiosks, no shortage of restrooms.  Thought ticket prices were a bit high for a mid-major program, but a good experience overall.  Just too bad UC can't fill a small 40K seat stadium routinely, hard to convince a Power 5 conference to add a school with limited local support."
1909,Date of experience: November 2018,12-Nov-18,Big 12,Cincinnati,5,Love My Bearcats,"I don't think there's a more intimate ONLINE campus in the country.  53 years old, I grew on this campus.  It's a beautiful venue."
1910,Date of experience: September 2018,24-Sep-18,Big 12,Cincinnati,5,Fun Stadium for a College Game,We've been to Nippert Stadium for UC football games several times. It's a nice intimate stadium in the heart of campus. Be prepared to walk a lot of hills and steps getting to the stadium and then getting to your seat. UC is a seriously hilly campus! Nice food selection and plenty of bathrooms. Also recommend pre-paying for parking as it's difficult to get a parking spot for the game without one.
1911,Date of experience: September 2018,23-Sep-18,Big 12,Cincinnati,4,FCCincinnati Game,Really a fantastic atmosphere to hold a crowd of 26k enthusiastic fans cheering on their club. Plenty of room to get around. Fairly easy to get to. Restrooms are fine. I do enjoy coming here.
1914,Date of experience: August 2017,27-Aug-17,Big 12,Cincinnati,4,Home to UC Football & Pro Soccer,"Located in the center of the compact University of Cincinnati campus, this nice, 40,000 seat stadium is the home venue for Bearcat football as well as Cincinnati??s professional soccer team, FC Cincinnati.Interestingly, the playing surface is located below grade such that when one exits the adjacent Tangeman University Center and enters the stadium, the field and lower seating sections are below you while the upper level and club seating is immediately above."
1916,Date of experience: November 2019,23-Sep-20,Big 12,Colorado,5,Breathtaking,"THE best college football venue. No one else in the world like Folsom Field. Climb up to section 217 and look at the Flatirons sitting over campus. Go in to the historic landmark of Balch Fieldhouse to pick up a beer in a sustainable cup you can take home. Stand in the student section before the game for the deafening chant of ""WE WANT RALPHIE"". Walk around the beautiful Fall campus afterwards as everyone pours out. Folsom Field should be on every college fan's bucket list"
1917,Date of experience: October 2019,15-Dec-19,Big 12,Colorado,5,Terrific College Football Venue,"I've been to many games at Folsom Field.  CU plays in one of the most beautiful settings in all of college football and it's a must if you're a college football fan.  The stadium seats maybe 50-ish thousand people so it's not a big stadium.  The views from all seats are good but the view from the east side, watching the game with the mountains as your backdrop, is pretty spectacular."
1918,Date of experience: November 2019,11-Nov-19,Big 12,Colorado,5,Homecoming 2019,Ralphie did not run today because she was not 100%.  She was at Ralphie's corral for pictures.  Go Buffs Go.
1919,Date of experience: October 2019,5-Nov-19,Big 12,Colorado,1,"Go Buffs, Fix it up!  Where is your Sportsmanship?","We are CU supporters as both daughter and son-in-law are graduates of this fantastic university.  But we recently attended the CU-USC game and were very disappointed (read upset) about the low level of sportsmanship.  The Old Fieldhouse on the west side is a huge fire trap, this needs to get on a capital improvements project.  The visitors are relegated to small corner in the NW side of the field, where the bleacher seats are so narrow, a normal person (do not even consider a large to XL size person) could never fit.  We witnessed ROW 7 get to the point where there was not even 1/8 inch left.  We were lucky to book 6 seats for 5 people, rented the stadium chairs (which help greatly in establishing your space), and barely had room.  So that means the seat spacing should be increased by a minimum of 1/6 (read 16.67%).  The level of sportsmanship was so low, there were several CU fans with Triple X rated speech in front of the family crowd.  Come on Buffs, you can do much better."
1920,Date of experience: October 2019,27-Oct-19,Big 12,Colorado,2,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for Folsom Field and I felt kind of let down.  Maybe I went to CU on a bad night.  It started badly when I was served some awful pizza.  The chicken tenders I had weren??t much better.  Then Ralphie didn??t run before kickoff.  The facility has seen some improvements lately but it seems like you need to be a rich booster to use them.  I paid $25 to have access to a rooftop and that was nice.  I wish I would have stayed there.  Plus, they need a way to slow down beer sales a touch.  Lots of drunk people tend to ruin football games."
1921,Date of experience: November 2018,4-Sep-19,Big 12,Colorado,5,Such a great stadium!,I have been to CU Football games here and wow!  It is a beautiful sight.  If in Boulder stop in and see it.  The entire campus is gorgeous.
1924,Date of experience: September 2018,17-Sep-18,Big 12,Colorado,4,Sit on the West side,"Watched CU beat New Hampshire 45-14 on 9/15/18 from 3PM - 7PM; At 2:30 go into the field house on the west side next to the Stadium to hear the CU band play school fight songs before the game. Lots of fun. Was a very hot day; high was 91 degrees and inside the fieldhouse probably 100 degrees with no a/c; we had seats on the 50 yard line on the shady at 3PM west (visitor) side:  section 106, row 32, seats 7 & 8; $150 each.  There are no water bottle filling stations...just old fashioned drinking fountains.  Stadium is hard metal bench seats with no seat back; you can rent attachable cushioned seats with back for $8 before you go inside the stadium.  Can't bring in seat cushions that have zippers or compartments; security very strict.  East side was in full baking sun, probably 100 degrees.  Team mascot, Ralphie, a 1000 pound female buffalo, runs onto the field leading the football team at the start of the game and start of the second half.  She stays in an air conditioned travel trailer at the north end of the field.  Overall was a fun game.  Just pick your seats carefully."
1925,Date of experience: September 2018,16-Sep-18,Big 12,Colorado,4,Great football experience,"This college stadium is amazing. Was here for a football game and the atmosphere was electric.We were towards the top of the seating at the south end and sight lines were very good. In fact, looking at the stadium layout, I suspect that there are no restricted view seats. Seats are simply metal benches and not particularly comfortable for a 3 hour plus, game. However there were places to hire seat cushions with backs making the seating much more comfortable.From the east stand there are good views to the mountains.The walk to the stadium is through the campus with attractive buildings."
1927,Date of experience: August 2017,26-Jul-18,Big 12,Colorado,4,Good for a game or concert.,"Once in, the place is laid out nice and easy to navigate.  But trying to get out with 60,000 of your closest friends can be a bit of a pain.  Bolt early if the game is out of reach or if you don't absolutely have to hear the encore."
1929,Date of experience: November 2017,3-Mar-18,Big 12,Colorado,4,Home of the Colorado Buffaloes,"Folsom Field is the historic stadium where the Colorado Buffaloes play football.  Every year four or five Pac12 games and one or two non-conference games are on the schedule.  Most of the stadium has wonderful views of the field.  Concessions are not as good as they should be, and run a little on the high-priced side for the value received,  Wine and beer are available for consumption in designated areas."
1930,Date of experience: November 2017,15-Nov-17,Big 12,Colorado,5,College football,This is an absolutely beautiful football stadium in a beautiful town. The stadium has a great bar area at the top corner of stadium. Watching ralphie is a must see in college football. Most of the fans were nice. I would send my son to go to school here; very impressive.
1931,Date of experience: November 2017,12-Nov-17,Big 12,Colorado,4,Game Visit,"Went with out of town family for football game.  Parking can be found thru various campus buildings.  The building are spread out, huge campus.  They do run shuttles from the parking spots.  Stadium is not the typical cookie cutter.  Lots of stone work!  Beautiful design.  Food/beer vendors on the outskirts of the inside of the stadium.  No beer allowed in the interior, fan section, of the field.  Metal stadium benches, so bring something to sit on.  Also check website for what you can and cannot bring in.  Had our kids at the game, lots of other children there, so the crowd, minus one or two inebriated inviduals, were very respectful with the language.  Security abundant through out stadium for ""issues"".  If weatehr is nice, I do suggest parking on the oustskirts of the campus and walk/shuttle in."
1932,Date of experience: October 2017,10-Oct-17,Big 12,Colorado,4,Aging stadium with pleasant amenities,"Much more intimate setting than the 100,000 seat stadiums of the Big10. There are definitely signs of age in the bleachers; faded paint and rust spots. The fan experiences for failies with kids is a special treat for young folks. Lots of concessions options along the concourse. And our favorite feature, the food and beer vendors in the adjoining field house with a large screen TV to stay on top of the game. Something everyone should do once. Hints: 1) Look for a Groupon or Trip Advisor deal for a non-conference game to save a few bucks. 2) Park at the Research Center for $10 and take the free shuttle to and from the stadium."
1933,Date of experience: September 2017,17-Sep-17,Big 12,Colorado,4,"My daughter's alma mater, fun day in the sun","Both of my kids attended CU and I've visited this venue many times since 2005. This is an old stadium that they have added sky boxes which are beautiful at face value, but somewhat diminished the architectural beauty of this elderly facility. They added a building with more suites in the northeast corner. The stadium is very easy to navigate with a wide mezzanine and easy steps. Sight lines are good, but it would be a stretch to say there are no bad sight lines. There are no obstructed views, but there are long views and far away views. Cheap seats are plenty, big games are a different story. Great venue on sunny afternoons!"
1934,Date of experience: August 2017,12-Sep-17,Big 12,Colorado,5,Crazy on game day.,"It is a beautiful field; games are fun. Park as far away as possible and ride the shuttle. Often, recently, there is construction and road closures - so getting to the other side is not a straight shot. Still, a beautiful and worthwhile campus in which to walk."
1935,Date of experience: September 2017,10-Sep-17,Big 12,Colorado,4,Buffs burn Texas State,"Headed to Folsom Field for the first time since I attended CU in the early 70's.  I was meeting up with my college roommate to re-connect, reminisce, and watch the Buffs put away the Texas State Bobcats.Folsom Field is an interesting mix of the old and the new.  The stadium proper (bleacher seating) is essentially the same as it was 40+ years ago, except more worn and tired.  But functional.  Kinda like me now that I think about it.Unlike me, though, there have been a lot of upgrades: the concourse added around the stadium to house vendors and above which they've built box seats for the ""special"" folks that populate that world.The most significant upgrade in my opinion is the field's playing surface.  In my day it was Astroturf, a clean, even fake grass that while it improved footing over natural turf, eventually lost favor because it tended to cause more injuries to the players.  The new artificial turf looks surprisingly real.   We enjoyed our day visiting this old 'haunt' from our college days and watching the Buffs kick butt at Folsom Field."
1936,Date of experience: August 2017,26-Aug-17,Big 12,Colorado,5,Insane!,"This place is insane! Being from the UK you expect the US stadiums to be a lot smaller, this place is crazy big. Go and visit! You won't be disappointed!"
1937,Date of experience: November 2016,22-Jun-17,Big 12,Colorado,4,How many stadiums can you watch both the game and mountains?,"Went to a game here last fall. Have been to a lot of football stadiums over the years. Had a pretty high up seat, could still see the field well. But this is the only place I've seen a football game where, if you're up high, you can watch the sunset over the mountains!"
1940,Date of experience: August 2016,16-Sep-16,Big 12,Colorado,4,Makeover complete,Folsom field is a very good and versatile facility.  The fact that it is right on campus and can be used for more than just football is a plus.  The beautiful sandstone finishes make it an architectural plus
1941,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,Big 12,Colorado,5,CU Football,My girlfriend is a CU graduate and I'm and SDSU graduate.  We went to a CU game this past weekend and I must say the stadium and campus are awesome.
1942,Date of experience: August 2016,25-Aug-16,Big 12,Colorado,5,College Football Stadium - Go Buffs!,"Awesome place to watch a college football game.  The students, fans, and alumni have so much Buff Pride.  Best part if watching Ralphie Run.  If you are visiting the campus the stadium is a must see."
1943,Date of experience: October 2015,25-Aug-16,Big 12,Colorado,4,Old Classic Stadium,"Folsom Field on the University Colorado campus is your old style grand stadium.  They recently added a new modern section in one end zone with boxes and suites.Stadium has a nice college feel to it.   It is old and could use some updating, but it is classic."
1944,Date of experience: August 2016,24-Aug-16,Big 12,Colorado,4,Nice old stadium,"A really nice old stadium at the middle of the university campus of Boulder, very impressive and worth to visit."
1945,Date of experience: August 2016,23-Aug-16,Big 12,Colorado,5,Awesome College Football Venue,The new additions to the Football complex are REALLY nice!   The field is just as awesome in person as it looks on TV!
1946,Date of experience: August 2016,20-Aug-16,Big 12,Colorado,5,A Great Stadium,"A beautiful stadium, no bad seats. Full of Buff Pride. Catch Ralphie IV or V run on. They know how to put on a great show."
1947,Date of experience: August 2016,2-Aug-16,Big 12,Colorado,4,Ran the bolder boulder,Well this is a very nice field and I really enjoy Folsom Field very big very green and lots of activities!  The fall there is football and in the summer there are all kinds of shows and fireworks.
1952,Date of experience: November 2015,27-Jun-16,Big 12,Colorado,4,Football & Bolder Boulder finish,University of Colorado football games can be fun to watch at Folsom Field. A good view of the field from any seat.  The Bolder Boulder finish is in the stadium so fun for the runner/walkers & the spectators.
1955,Date of experience: September 2015,16-Apr-16,Big 12,Colorado,5,West side seating affords incredible views of the Flatirons and the Buffaloes PAC 12 football games!,"Come watch Ralphie run from this great football venue located on the most beautiful campus in the country.  Nestled close to the foothills both Green and Bear Mountains rise over 3,000 feet above you.  Classic Italian architecture with red tile roofs make this campus and stadium one of the finest in the US."
1956,Date of experience: October 2015,31-Mar-16,Big 12,Colorado,5,Fabulous Football Venue,I am from the crazy college football of the south but this football venue rivals any stadium that I have been too. I love going to see a college football game in Folsom Field. The stadium has plenty of food & beverage venues that are super good as well as good seating to view the game. End zone seating is fun too! CU is my adopted college football team of the west.
1957,Date of experience: November 2015,29-Nov-15,Big 12,Colorado,4,their alot,I m their quite abit its near the c.university library it has a good turnout in the summer by locals
1958,Date of experience: September 2015,14-Oct-15,Big 12,Colorado,4,Game Day Fun,Recently spent a beautiful afternoon enjoying a game at Folsom Field. The surrounding area is gorgeous and the facility is very nice and very well maintained. The lines at food/drink stands moved quickly and employees were friendly. I really enjoyed my time here!
1959,Date of experience: October 2015,6-Oct-15,Big 12,Colorado,4,beautiful campus,"On of the neatest college stadiums around ,the duck fans went on and on about what a beautiful campus  to goto every day."
1960,Date of experience: October 2014,30-Aug-15,Big 12,Colorado,5,unique stadium with great view to the rocky mountains,unique stadium with great view to the rocky mountains! Has a lot of history and was cool to see the buffalo run out onto the field before the football game.
1962,Date of experience: October 2014,13-Aug-15,Big 12,Colorado,5,Gorgeous Stadium with spectacular Rocky Mountain Views,"A gorgeous stadium with views to die for.  Football games here are a blast and who doesn't love watching Ralphie run? If you're contemplating a visit to Boulder, add a Buffs game to your agenda!"
1964,Date of experience: October 2014,3-Jul-15,Big 12,Colorado,5,Best stadium,How can you not love this place.  Beautiful stadium and area to watch the game.  If you get a good fall afternoon it can be amazing.  Sit on the east side of the stadium for the best views.
1967,Date of experience: October 2014,26-Apr-15,Big 12,Colorado,5,Great Place To Watch Football,"This 50,000 seat stadium is the perfect football venue. Sit on the East side for a beautifulview of the mountains. For one game we sat in the last row, and heard people complaining about their seats. We went to Michigan, and our last row seats in Folsom would be about halfway up in The Big House. So, no complaints at all. Only wish for Folsom would be better food options, and, yes, better CU football teams."
1968,Date of experience: October 2014,21-Jan-15,Big 12,Colorado,5,"So the football team has had some tough times, but just being in this stadium makes it all worthwhile","Win or lose, fans will always have a good time here - surrounded by the scenic beauty of the Flatirons, and conveniently situated on one of the most beautiful college campuses in the world, you won't be disappointed.  Take in a game or other activity at the stadium, then take a stroll around campus - lots of character, excellent architecture and history on this college campus.  You'll want to come back and spend more time here."
1970,Date of experience: November 2014,11-Dec-14,Big 12,Colorado,5,Not Many Better Venues to Watch a Football Game,"If you sit on the east side of the stadium you have a great view of the Flatirons to the west - spectacular.  Not many better places, if any, to watch a college football game on a fall afternoon"
1971,Date of experience: November 2014,10-Nov-14,Big 12,Colorado,5,UC v. Washington football game,"Great stadium in a great location.  Crowd was nice.  Team could be better.  Seats were decent.  I'm used to (and love!) ""SEC Football"" but it was nice to see a big crowd that didn't need to be all dressed up to watch a football game."
1972,Date of experience: October 2014,6-Nov-14,Big 12,Colorado,4,Ralphie!,Older stadium. Picture opporunities with Ralphie.  Fun to watch him lead the team on the field. I thought we paid a lot for tickets considering the number of empty seats.  Wont do that next time.  CU kinda gets screwed on Game start times.  11am...Really come on.   I think they get a fair number of late starts as well which hurts attendance.
1973,Date of experience: October 2014,24-Oct-14,Big 12,Colorado,5,Best tailgating ever!,"This is by far the friendliest football stadium I've ever been too.. And I was rooting for the other team!  Great tailgating.  Beautiful stadium.  Watching Ralphie run onto the field was amazing!  My seat was in the CU student section and they tolerated me well, and I'm a totally obnoxious football fan.  Great experience that I highly recommend."
1974,Date of experience: September 2014,1-Oct-14,Big 12,Colorado,3,Average College Football Experience,"Overall, i found the Folsom Field experience to be average.The good points. 1. The views. If you sit on the visiting side, the views of the Flatirons and surrounding mountains are beautiful. 2. Ralphie. Watching the CU mascot run is a cool treat for any college football fan. The not so bad points. 1. The stadium is quite old and overall and average experience. There isn't anything outstanding about the stadium itself. The atmosphere is subdued, most likely in large part because the Buffs haven't been very good for some time. 2. The cost. I found the visit here to be quite a bit more expensive than the places i see games back home. $14.00 for a couple bottled waters?If you are a die hard college football fan, i'm sure you'd find a game here enjoyable, just don't expect anything to be out of this world memorable."
1975,Date of experience: September 2014,27-Sep-14,Big 12,Colorado,4,"Beautiful views, know before you go","This was our first visit to the stadium for the Buffs homecoming game.  Here are some things you might need to know if you don't frequent other stadiums.  Read the list of restricted items on the websites on sizes of coolers and bags allowed.  Arrive early because there is no public parking close to the entrance; closer lots are for donors; public lots on campus are $25 per car and they fill early.  You can park at the 29th Street mall and walk.  It also takes a while to get through the gate since they wand you and look in your bags.  If it is sunny and warm, bring sunscreen and hats, and lots of water.  Many people around us left early due to the heat and sunburn (even though the Buffs were winning!).  Traffic control was efficient despite the crowds.  The views of the mountains from the stadium were beautiful, even if you aren't a football fan.  And watching Ralphie run at the start of the game and after halftime was a unique experience."
1976,Date of experience: September 2014,24-Sep-14,Big 12,Colorado,5,Watching Ralphie run was the highlight!,Watching a football game at CU is great... Watching Ralphie run even when the team is not doing so well is a great deal of fun.
1977,Date of experience: October 2013,23-Sep-14,Big 12,Colorado,4,A Must Do in Boulder,"Great experience in perfect weather. It's not as huge as other college football stadiums but it was my alma mater so it mattered. It's not everyday that you watch a football game below but when you look up and around, you see mountains."
1979,Date of experience: October 2013,21-Jul-14,Big 12,Colorado,5,Best Football Stadium in the Country,"The Buffs aren't very good these days, but that doesn't mean you should skip Folsom Field. It has hands down the most beautiful stadium view I've ever seen as it looks onto the Flat Irons and base of the Rocky Mountains. The atmosphere is great as Ralphie the Buffalo storms onto the field in what is one of the finest college traditions. Mark this trip on your list if your team is visiting Boulder. You'll probably see a win at the very least."
1980,Date of experience: October 2013,20-Feb-14,Big 12,Colorado,3,Beautiful views and campus,"I have been to about 10 college football stadiums.  I would rate this one as average as far as atmosphere.  The fans of course are rude to oppossing fan base.  The stadium is nice, not very loud."
1981,Date of experience: September 2013,12-Feb-14,Big 12,Colorado,3,Average college stadium,"I have been to several college football stadiums and have to say Folsom Field is simply average.  The view of the mountains in the background is spectacular, but the stadium and surroundings are average.  It is not a bad university, but small and insignificant compared to the rest of the Big 12 and Pac 12."
1982,Date of experience: January 2014,18-Jan-14,Big 12,Colorado,5,Incredible 'Forum'!,"The Romans had their amphitheatre and Boulder has its Folsom Field. We watched this being constructed and marvelled as we saw it emerge. Strolling by evokes memories of Graduations and Boulder Boulder finish lines! With both boys graduated and hardly another race left in me, it's great to just walk by and reminisce."
1983,Date of experience: November 2013,8-Jan-14,Big 12,Colorado,5,Great college atmosphere,"This is a great place to go for a college football game.  Yes, this place has had a reputation of poor treatment of opposing fans in the past.   However, those days are really in the past.  There is a great gameday atmosphere outside and inside the stadium.  The trick is finding a parking spot.  I usually recommend parking at the Harvest House hotel and walking to the stadium.  If you've never gone to a game there, avoid the student section.  You'll be fine anywhere on the West side of the stadium.  Make sure you get to the game in time to watch the band do their pre-game in the field house on the west side of the stadium...and of course don't miss the most powerful mascot in all of college sports--Ralphie the buffalo.  She leads the team onto the field prior to the game and again at halftime.  Now, if the Buffs could just have a winning team..."
1984,Date of experience: September 2013,25-Nov-13,Big 12,Colorado,1,Horrible addition to Boulder,This is an eye sore even from the mountains.  It is a pity that the University is not required to abide by the environment policies that keep Boulder much more environment and people friendly.  The lights from the stadium ruin the night sky from 15 or more miles away.  The noise can be a problem as well.  No excuse for ruining the sky line with this hulk.
1985,Date of experience: October 2013,7-Nov-13,Big 12,Colorado,4,Nice college football stadium,"Folsom Field is the home of the University of Colorado football team.  The stadium is not that large, holding approximately 53,500 seats.  As such, you have a more intimate feel than larger stadiums found elsewhere.  The stadium is located on the university campus, which has both its advantages and disadvantages.  You have the option to walk around the campus prior or after the game, which is nice to kill some time.  Otherwise the campus is not that picturesque.  Parking is the main disadvantage.  I would recommend parking in one of the satellite lots which cost $10.  There is a free shuttle that will take you to the stadium.  It starts about 3 hours prior to kick-off and goes until 45 minutes after the game ends.  There are parking lots closer for $20, but by parking in the lots further away allows you to beat the traffic in the end.  Just make sure to memorize your surroundings as some of the bus drivers get confused where to stop and you might have to back-track a little.They have an organized pre-game party area open to everyone with free food, games and other events.  Ralphie, the live buffalo mascot, is also located in a pen prior to kick-off.  The festivities are located across the street from the main entrance to the stadium.  Just look for the big blown-up buffalo.  There is also a tailgating field next to the stadium.  This is the only place that is authorized for alcohol consumption.Gates to the stadium open two hours to kick-off.  There are vendors located throughout the stadium.  I was surprised with the variety of choices, while expectedly overpriced, was still good.  The men's bathroom had plenty of stalls, but an inadequate number of sinks.  They looked dated, which looked out of place given the condition of the rest of the stadium.  I would recommend walking along the concourses to get a good feel of the atmosphere.While the football team is not that good, the atmosphere is still pretty good.  I enjoyed watching Ralphie run on to the field twice, once before the game and the other during halftime.  It was too bad that the local fans didn't support their team, as the stadium was nowhere close to full even during the first half.  If they ever show up, the atmosphere would be much better.  However if you are a fan of the opposing team, they at least make you feel at home.If you are a college football fan, I would recommend visiting Folsom Field."
1986,Date of experience: August 2013,4-Sep-13,Big 12,Colorado,4,Amazing CU Buffs football field.,This field is home to the University of Colorado's Buffaloes.  It is a beautiful and extremely well maintained field.  The Buffs won their first game in Denver so hopefully they will keep it up at their own field. Stop by and see a game and support CU.  Go Buffs!
1987,Date of experience: October 2012,5-Aug-13,Big 12,Colorado,5,Go Buffs!,"So I am biased; I am a Buff fan. I didn't attend CU, but I love the beauty of the location of this stadium. Yes it is getting old and needs a lot of fixing up, but sitting there on a fall Saturday watching a football game helps me forget the current status of the team!You don't have to attend a game to see the place. Walk around it on a non-game day, though you can't get inside, you still get a good feel for the place.Bath rooms need much improvement, by there are plans."
1988,Date of experience: October 2012,9-Jun-13,Big 12,Colorado,4,"Nice field, close to the action","Although the Buffs haven't been that great as of late, this is still a fun place to see a game.  No matter where you are sitting you feel very close to the action."
1991,Date of experience: December 2012,1-Jan-13,Big 12,Colorado,5,Views on and off the football field,"It was a tough football season for the Colorado Buffaloes, but Folsom Field offers great views as well as a football venue. Ralphie (the bison mascot) is a breath-taking vision as she runs around the field."
1992,Date of experience: November 2012,4-Dec-12,Big 12,Colorado,5,GO BUFFS!!,"Win or lose, Folsom Field, home of the Colorado Buffalo football team, provides one of the most gorgeous back drops of any stadium in the country,the place to be for tail gate parties, and let's not forget ""Ralphie"" the famous Colorado mascot who runs the field with her handlers to the delight of the crowd!!   Folsom Field is also the home of the Finish Line of the world famous ""Bolder Boulder""  which is run each May with elite runners from around the world joined by thousands of runners  turning out for competitive exercise or just sheer fun.  Fourth of July is a huge community event at Folsom Field that provides fun for the entire family culminating in a glorious array of fireworks all against the backdrop of the Flatirons  and the foothills of the Rocky Mountains!"
1993,Date of experience: November 2012,25-Nov-12,Big 12,Colorado,5,Washington at Colorado football game,"Washington beat Colorado. My freind I went with is a big Washington fan. They lost the previous 4 games we went to. We had great seats on the 35 yard line. There were a lot of empty seats, but I expected that. Since the voters in Colorado recently legalized marijuana I will never go there again. I hate pot and pot smokers."
1994,Date of experience: November 2012,23-Nov-12,Big 12,Colorado,5,Great place to enjoy a Saturday afternoon football game.,"The view from the stadium is magnifcent.  Surrounded by the Flatirons, a clear fall afternoon is something to behold.  The views of the field are excellent, friendly staff and clean safe stadium. Watching the CU Buffalo's mascot Ralphie race around the field leading the football team at the start of the game and the second half is worth the price of the ticket."
1995,Date of experience: November 2012,9-Nov-12,Big 12,Colorado,3,sit on east side,bench seats in this classic 50's stadium--but sitting on east side so that you face foothills during game is quite a sight--it will even get better when CU gets a football team
1996,Date of experience: November 2012,6-Nov-12,Big 12,Colorado,5,A truly amazing place to watch a football game,I have had season tickets for 23 years.  This stadium is such a great place to enjoy football.  The scenery is incredible as you are seated in the stadium.
1997,Date of experience: September 2012,13-Oct-12,Big 12,Colorado,5,The One and Only Folsom Field,This is the best place in the country to attend a football game. Nothing compares to the game day experience in this location! Add in the pageantry and your favorite team for a perfect Saturday afternoon.
1998,Date of experience: November 2011,2-Aug-12,Big 12,Colorado,5,The best place to see a football game,"You can not find a better place to watch college football game than high in the east stands. Football on the field and the Flatirons (mountains to non-boulderites) in the distance. I'm still waiting for the support the SEC fans give their teams but it is coming. When the stands are filled to capacity it will be better, but then you won't be able to get a ticket. Try to buy a ticket in the club level- the food there is great and beer and wine are sold. There are also food trucks around the stadium that have 4 star food. Come and watch the Buffs!"
2002,Date of experience: October 2011,19-Jun-12,Big 12,Colorado,3,Football Field,Folsom Field in Boulder is on CU campus.  An occasional football game is always fun and crowded.  Usually a nice setting.
2016,Date of experience: November 2019,21-Nov-19,Big 12,Houston,4,Pleasant evening,"Nicely sized stadium for a non-power 5 program. Clean,good restroom access,decent food options.Visitors seating was in the endzone,but it appeared the sideline seats were good viewlines.Parking was a mess! Signage for cash parking and even the stadium was not good for someone unfamiliar with the area."
2017,Date of experience: November 2018,23-Nov-18,Big 12,Houston,5,Entertaining Night,A nice evening at a great price.  A good display by the marching band at half time and I got selfies with some of them.   Clean and modern stadium.
2018,Date of experience: October 2017,6-Jun-18,Big 12,Houston,5,New home of the University of Houston Cougars,"In order to compete with other members of their conference, U of H  built a nice new stadium that seats more fans. They have always been an exciting football team and have ruined many a day for their opponents. Fun to watch, and my wife's alma mater BTW."
2019,Date of experience: October 2017,11-Oct-17,Big 12,Houston,5,"Great games, great price!!",We simply love to go to TDECU Stadium to watch the cougars play football! The fans are awesome and the stadium is clean! Much cheaper than going to see the Texans and much more  excitement and show for half time! Great hometown feel! Go Coogs!
2022,Date of experience: November 2016,7-Dec-16,Big 12,Houston,5,"Excellent Stadium, even if my team didn't win","I came here to see a college football game.  The stadium was great.  Laid out nicely, with a lot of nice concessions.  Great views from everywhere you could see.  Stadium was easy to get in and out of as well."
2023,Date of experience: October 2016,14-Nov-16,Big 12,Houston,5,Gorgeous facilities,Visited for a Houston Cougar football game and was mighty impressed. Great view of downtown is not the only attraction here. Plenty of food choices. Club seats have backs while general admission do not - so plan accordingly. Arrive in time for Cougar Walk.
2024,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Nov-16,Big 12,Houston,4,University of Houston Cougars Football Game 11/12/2016,"This is the first time I've been to TDECU Stadium and had a hard figuring out available parking from the UH website.  I decided to park my car at the Palm Center Transit Center just south of the stadium and ride the Metro-rail.  So glad I did - it was easy, quick & drops you right in front of the stadium.  Free parking & no charge for rail on game days.  The new stadium is great, except people move around a lot, which I found unusual.  It appears the college kids go more for the socializing instead of the game lol!"
2025,Date of experience: October 2016,12-Oct-16,Big 12,Houston,4,Great Place for College Football,"We recently visited the stadium to watch the Coogs play football. The stadium itself is very nice. The walkways within the stadium are nice and wide, so the crowds can flow through easily. The biggest issue we had was with the stairs. We had seats on the visitor side of the stadium and there were no elevators handy. We had one person recovering from knee surgery and one elderly with hip issues. Given this, the amount of stairs required to get to the second level of the stadium was quite a lot. Easily 35+ stairs to get to the bottom of the section, then additional stairs to get to your row. We actually ended up sitting in some empty seats that were lower than our original seats due to the stair issue. Beyond that, everything was great. Lots of concessions and bathrooms."
2026,Date of experience: September 2016,18-Sep-16,Big 12,Houston,5,Coogs House is impressive!,This is a great place to view a college football gamme! It all starts before the game begins as the university allows for a great tailgating atmosphere. The student body has their own section while the alumni have a great area for themselves.  The inside of the stadium is wonderful. I would suggest you have stadium seats for added comfort. The areas for walkways are very accommodating to fans ability to move about easily. Nice jumbotron is good for reviews. I love the ability to look out the west end and see the fantastic downtown skyline. You can have a great time in this stadium!
2027,Date of experience: September 2016,8-Sep-16,Big 12,Houston,5,A woman's stadium,"This stadium was built with women in mind. Visit the bathrooms, and you will see why. There are plenty of stalls housed in clean bathrooms. Otherwise, the seating arrangement is great, the screens large, and the food great."
2028,Date of experience: August 2015,8-Jan-16,Big 12,Houston,5,"A Small Stadium, home to the Houston Dynamo at one time","Visited the TDECU ( was then called the Robertson Stadium) which was home to the dynamo back in the days.The atmosphere and event was quite enjoyable. Dynamo were playing against the Columbus Crewe. The home team won in the end. There were lots of pre-game activities, such as cheerleaders dancing and entertaining the crowds.Also a Christian rock band was playing and entertaining everyone! Their mascot was very cool - Diesel!"
2029,Date of experience: November 2015,8-Dec-15,Big 12,Houston,4,Medium Sized Stadium for College Football Fun,"Home to the Houston Cougars, TDECU Stadium is a newer college football stadium located right in the heart of the University of Houston campus. The stadium holds about 40,000 and, with its open ends, could be expanded in the future to hold about 20,000 more fans as they cheer the Cougars to victory.I was well aware of the new University of Houston football stadium for some time, but I didn??t make it to a game until just recently, right after Thanksgiving. I quickly found many things to like about TDECU stadium, and the wide concourses are at the top of the list. This is very different from the previous stadium, which featured narrow walking areas that made it difficult to reach vendors and wait in line. There are a good number of restrooms, too, and a nice variety of food and drink for a college stadium. And the view from the south, or home, seats is very nice because it includes a wide open Houston skyline in the near distance.TDECU Stadium is medium size and this is nice for those who want the college football experience but don??t want to get lost in a massive crowd. However, guests need to be prepared to sit on bench- style seats as opposed to individual seats, as bench style seating comprises almost all of the seats in the stadium. Perhaps even more importantly, guests need to think twice before sitting in the upper levels. These upper sections are steep and you may find yourself out of breath when you finally reach your seat. It would be nice if there were restrooms on this top level, but there are not. Still, it??s not too bad because you can easily hop on the elevator or walk a flight of steps to get to the next level down, where ample restrooms await.TDECU Stadium is open on its two ends and there is usually a good breeze blowing. In the future, if the team does well and continues to attract new fans, they may fill in the open ends of the stadium and expand capacity. When that happens, some of the view may be gone but the stadium should remain nice and comfy. I like the medium capacity and it??s not too difficult to walk here from any area of the UH campus. It??s a fun place to visit and a great way to watch a division one college game, so plan a visit to TDECU Stadium if you haven??t already."
2030,Date of experience: November 2015,29-Nov-15,Big 12,Houston,4,UH vs Navy,First time in this stadium. Was very nice & clean. The seats are definitely not for fat people though. Luckily the seats down from us were never filled. Awesome game. Beautiful field.
2031,Date of experience: September 2014,11-Jul-15,Big 12,Houston,5,Great New College Football Stadium,"In 2014 for the first time ever, the University of Houston Cougar football team played in a brand new stadium that was built just for them.  While the Coogs returned to campus about 15 years ago to play at a refurbished Robertson Stadium, that old stadium was built in 1942 by HISD for HISD.  I love the wide and open concourses at TDECU Stadium.  Combined with the corrugated metal mesh exterior which allows air flow and natural light into the stadium, there always seems to be a breeze.  The restrooms and concessions are plentiful. Aramark (who serves food at NRG Stadium for Texan games) has the food contract.  Each of the concession stands has its own kitchen, so the food is freshly prepared.There is ample parking on campus and the Metro SouthEast Light Rail line has a stop 75 yards from one of the stadium entrances.  Fans can park downtown or anywhere along the line and ride the train to the game.  There is a lot of green space around the stadium for tailgating.  Cullen Boulevard  closes on game days to allow for tailgating tents to set up along the street.Finally, I really like the skyline view from the ""home"" or South stands.  UH hit a home run with this stadium.For those visiting Houston in the fall, check the UH home football schedule at UHCougars.com to see if a game is scheduled at TDECU the weekend of your stay."
2033,Date of experience: October 2022,29-Jan-23,Big 12,Kansas state,5,Amazing food,Best tailgate experience is with west side RV's. You'll see the smoke and you'll never have better meats. Bring a quality meat and they'll cook it for you and you can take part.
2034,Date of experience: September 2021,17-Sep-21,Big 12,Kansas state,5,Football game,"Always enjoy our time at the football games.  Food is a bit pricey, but everything else is enjoyable."
2036,Date of experience: October 2019,6-Nov-19,Big 12,Kansas state,5,Bill Snyder Family Stadium,The Bill Snyder Family Stadium is a great place to see some wonderful football wins for Kansas State University!
2037,Date of experience: September 2019,9-Oct-19,Big 12,Kansas state,5,College Football - FRIENDLY,"Friendliness to the extreme!  Everyone is helpful, polite, sincere... It's very easy to get around because of the maps and signs and friendly people."
2040,Date of experience: November 2018,23-Nov-18,Big 12,Kansas state,5,Very Friendly People,"My husband and I went to go to the Texas Tech- Kansas State Game.  My youngest son is an AG Education Grad Student at K-State.  I loved all the traditions that went with the game.  The only complaint I had, which the stadium couldn't help, was that it was extremely cold.  Other than that, I found it a fun experience."
2041,Date of experience: November 2018,20-Nov-18,Big 12,Kansas state,5,Terrific Game Day and Fan Experience,"While having come here for many years to football games, we are constantly amazed at the Game day experience enjoyed by all (with visiting or home team fans).  The stadium staff do everything they can to make one feel welcome - not once has a ticket stub scanner or security person or concession person failed to make us feel welcome using saying to ""Welcome to Bill Snyder FAmily Stadium"" - enjoy your day.  Some improvements in concessions, bathrooms, and concourse access this year and even the post game traffic handling is well thought out and managed.  We look forward to our visits and believe you would as well - give it a try!"
2042,Date of experience: November 2018,12-Nov-18,Big 12,Kansas state,5,Nice stadium experience,"We have a freshman at KSU now so have visited the football stadium 2 times.  I can say we were there at the hottest and coldest games so far so have tips for both.  We found very reasonable parking behind the hospital for $10 with just a short walk to the stadium.  There were port a potty units on the parking site.  There is good security at the entrance, with walk through metal detectors.  There are plenty of food/drink options and clean restrooms.  I saw lots of security and fan assistance workers available.  If you buy general admission tickets you will be in the sun no matter what.  Lots of seats are basic metal bleacher style so you should take a stadium seat in. The sun was awful for the 95 degree day but handy for the 35 degree day.  The band in fantastic and really keeps the crowd involved.  Very nice jumbo screens to keep you up on the game.  There are interactive texting and other fun activities on the screens also.  You can also go into the basketball field house next door to cool down or warm up if you just can't stay at the stadium . Fans are also allowed to leave and return into the stadium during half time.   It's a great time!"
2043,Date of experience: September 2018,30-Sep-18,Big 12,Kansas state,5,Fan Experience,The Bill is a great football facility. They have worked hard to make it the best Fan Experience in the Big 12. It's a great experience for the entire family and has plenty of food and drink choices during the game.
2044,Date of experience: September 2018,11-Sep-18,Big 12,Kansas state,5,Great game day atmosphere,As a fan of an opposing team we had a great time at Bill Synder family stadium. The facility was a great venue to watch a college football game. Plenty of parking relatively close to the stadium. The Kstate fans were very hospitable even after we won the game. The Harley riders before the game was something I had never witnessed. I would highly recommend attending a game here.
2045,Date of experience: September 2018,10-Sep-18,Big 12,Kansas state,5,Nicest fan base anywhere!,We are Mississippi State fans and we were in Manhattan for an away game. We follow our team religiously and the Kansas State fans are the friendliest we have ever encountered. I couldn??t count how many times we were welcomed and thanked for coming. The facilities were nice and he bathrooms were clean. We enjoyed our visit immensely!
2046,Date of experience: September 2018,4-Sep-18,Big 12,Kansas state,4,The tailgaing expirence needs work,"If you're a first timer here and are used to Chief's games the first thing you'll notice is the tailgating is completely different here.  There are several small lots in which you will pay anywhere from $20 -$40 to park instead of one giant parking lot party.  Most of these areas are on all grass so you must be mindful of hot coals or you'll set 500 cars ablaze.The stadium's decor mirrors that of the local area as it uses a lot of limestone.  It is very clean looking and easy to enter. The stadium's bowl is a giant boiling pot.  If you are at a noon game and it's above 80 that day you'll be in the direct sunlight then entire game unless you are inside of a suite. If you are at a late game sit on the visitor's side on the west end as they get the shadows first. Sitting on the east side simply puts you starting at the sun for most of the plays until the sun sets. Wear sunglasses, sunblock, and a hat and you'll be fine."
2047,Date of experience: January 2018,9-Jul-18,Big 12,Kansas state,5,Family Atmosphere!,Most beautiful stadium I've been in. The atmosphere on game days is the Best! Friendliest fans around. Not to mention the best coach in College Football.

2050,Date of experience: November 2017,21-Dec-17,Big 12,Kansas state,4,A Nice Venue,"I came here as an Iowa State fan to watch football. The atmosphere was great, and there is a lot of reverence for Bill Snyder (and rightfully so). The only problem was solved by the wife of the problem. No idea what she said, but whatever it was, he was awfully quiet for the remaining three quarters. ha ha ha. I'd come here again to see a game any time."
2051,Date of experience: December 2017,6-Dec-17,Big 12,Kansas state,5,Where else would you want to watch football,The Bill is the greatest show in Kansas. Unless you like KU basketball. Then go to the Phog. The pageantry and show is amazing. Love it.

2058,Date of experience: October 2016,10-May-17,Big 12,Kansas state,5,Football stadium,"Bill Snyder Family Stadium is a great place to watch the K-State football games, not a bad seat in the house. The stadium does allow tailgating which is a plus. Parking can be tricky come early."

2063,Date of experience: October 2016,9-Oct-16,Big 12,Kansas state,5,Class Act,"I have watched this stadium grow since 1968 and it is a great football venue. The Little Apple can be proud of the house that stands now. The new screen is great and I especially enjoy the names, numbers and stats that are available right after the play is run on the north scoreboard. Go Cats!"

2068,Date of experience: October 2019,20-Oct-19,Big 12,Oklahoma state,5,Impressive,"Yes for a little ole country town this stadium is the cats meow.  I attended OSU in the early 60??s then along came a country boy named T Boon Pickens and our stadium became the finest in the nation.   He not only helped with athletics but academics as well.All sports have grown and become nationally recognized sports.  So I brought back this past weekend the mother of my boys, her sister and husband.  I have never seen such growth and such beautification.  My biggest compliment is while attending the Baylor game the accommodations for handicapped parking is to be commended.  We can park in the parking garage and the shuttle takes us to the stadium.

2069,Date of experience: October 2019,9-Oct-19,Big 12,Oklahoma state,4,Everything You Could Want in a Football Game,"For a small town, this stadium is full of everything you would want. The food vendors are diverse - donuts, dipping dots, pizza, steakburgers, thai food, sushi, and regular stadium food and snacks. Beer, wine and espressos are on every corner. If you upgrade your tickets to club/suites, the possibilities are endless. The staff is over the top friendly and helpful. It's a must visit in Stillwater."
2070,Date of experience: September 2018,19-Aug-19,Big 12,Oklahoma state,5,Football game,Love the new video board! We love to come to OSU games!Large variety of concessions available. The first aid people are very caring and friendly.

2073,Date of experience: October 2018,20-Feb-19,Big 12,Oklahoma state,5,"Big, but feels intimate","Went to the Texas vs OSU game here, upset city!!!!!! Had no rooting interest & came to the game from Vegas just because I like college football enough to do that. It was a large stadium, but didn't feel toooo big, if that makes sense at all. Wasn't a bad seat in the house and it was easy to navigate in and around the stadium. Most of the seats are bleacher seating, but they do have seat backs available for purchase. Had a great experience and would recommend watching a game here."
2074,Date of experience: November 2018,18-Nov-18,Big 12,Oklahoma state,5,Intimate but rowdy place to see a football game.,Smaller stadium in comparison to our little sister to the south of us but a much better and rowdier place to see a football game in the state of Oklahoma.  Great food choices and BEER!
2075,Date of experience: October 2018,7-Nov-18,Big 12,Oklahoma state,5,I love this stadium and I am there every chance I get,"Go Pokes, win or lose I will always love you and I will always love TBP Stadium.  Thanks to a very (very) generous donation of our campus, an alum himself, we got a stadium makeover that is befitting the campus it represents.Great consession stands, at affordable prices.  Great seating, the best band ever."
2076,Date of experience: October 2018,4-Nov-18,Big 12,Oklahoma state,5,Great updates,"One of the best places to watch a college football game. The pregame rituals are not to be missed, and now they have more food options beside regular stadium food, drawback is they run out of food at halftime."
2077,Date of experience: October 2018,9-Oct-18,Big 12,Oklahoma state,4,"Nice Stadium, Overall Experience Could Improve","My friend and I take a trip every season to catch a football game at a different college. Our goal is to try and experience the best that college football has to offer. We ended up attending this year's OSU-Iowa State game. The stadium itself is fantastic. Everything was very clean and well kept. I don't think this stadium offers a bad seat, as the 60k capacity keeps things close to the field. I also didn't feel like we were being packed in tight, like I have experienced at other stadiums. The massive video board in the end zone is big enough to see replays perfectly, but is placed so that you don't find yourself watching it the whole game instead of the field. My rating on the stadium is 5/5.Separately, I'm going to review the overall game experience. OSU was one-loss and ranked in the top-25 at the game we attended, but that didn't translate into attendance. While the stadium was mostly full, there were quite a few areas that were empty. The two rows directly in front of our seats were open and there were lots of gaps in the crowd. I was disappointed to see that at a 60k capacity, OSU could fill the stadium when their team is doing well. I'm not sure if that was due to disinterest from the fans or the forecasted rain, but that still isn't an excuse. We had seen a lot on TV about the students that smack the paddles on the padding. This might have been the least impressive part of the entire experience. There wasn't much paddle banging and the noise that was put off wasn't that loud. The ""traditions"" that OSU uses are stolen from/similar to a lot of schools. There wasn't anything that really set the experience apart from any other school. We got to witness a close game, which featured OSU trying to comeback from a 9 point deficit. While this would have been a perfect opportunity for the fans to provide home field advantage, many left at the start of the 4th quarter, when the game was still very much undecided. OSU ended up losing by a touchdown. Fan experience: 2/5The venue is fantastic, but the overall experience still has a ways to go. Overall, I was a tad disappointed in what OSU offered, but it was still a fun trip."
2078,Date of experience: September 2018,23-Sep-18,Big 12,Oklahoma state,5,Great Football Venue!!!!,"While visiting family in OK was taken to a game here. Very nice stadium  with good field viewing from everywhere. Unbelievable video board, the size is just massive! Had a great time and would like to come here again"
2081,Date of experience: October 2017,18-Feb-18,Big 12,Oklahoma state,5,New OSU stadium,"Newly built the Boone Pickens stadium offers great security, food booths, chair rentals for bleacher seats and much more. Home to OSU Cowboys Football team. Easy access to many restaurants and hotels."
2082,Date of experience: September 2017,21-Jan-18,Big 12,Oklahoma state,5,Great Stadium,A wonderful place to watch a college football game ...Allow some extra time before the game so you can see everything that going on outside the stadium. We sat on the south side of the stadium and had great seats food and drinks are at a good price. Excitement is very high which makes the game more fun to watch The OSU Pokes may not win every game but students and players put their hearts into it . So Go Pokes
2083,Date of experience: November 2017,3-Jan-18,Big 12,Oklahoma state,5,"Senior Day, Football Game",I always enjoy going to the football games at Boone Pickens Stadium. There is lots to do not only inside the stadium but also on the north side before the ballgame. Go Pokes!!
2084,Date of experience: November 2017,21-Dec-17,Big 12,Oklahoma state,5,Stadium,A great place to watch a college football game.  Home to the Oklahoma State University Cowboys and Head Coach Mike Gundy.Many great OSU football players have gone on to NFL professional careers and Barry Sanders won the Heisman Trophy while playing football at OSU.
2085,Date of experience: September 2017,11-Nov-17,Big 12,Oklahoma state,5,Great Stadium and free parking on game day! Go Pokes!,"Parking is free at Stillwater High School and a free shuttle right to stadium. Just a great place to watch a game and food/drinks were priced fair. Seating on the North Side can get pretty hot in games early in the season.  Try to get seats on South or West End zone. FYI the stadium sits East-West not N-S as most fields do.  A few folks selling tickets outside stadium when we were there, so you probably can get in all games except the OU game. Be sure to get there early to see the campus and student union.  Hotels fill up fast so plane ahead."
2086,Date of experience: August 2017,10-Sep-17,Big 12,Oklahoma state,4,Go Pokes!,"I have attended college football games in numerous stadiums around the country, and Boone Pickens is one of the best (although, as an OSU fan, I might be a little biased).  The atmosphere is great, and the views of the field are good from anywhere in the stadium.  My only complaints are that the seats are too close together (yes, I get it, like most sports facilities they try to cram as many people in as possible), and their P.A. system is obnoxiously loud and screechy (was difficult to carry on a conversation, and I left with my ears ringing).  Also $4 for a bottle of water on a hot late-summer day seemed a little bit like price-gouging.  But nevertheless, it is a great experience to see a game at Boone Pickens stadium.  Go Cowboys!"
2087,Date of experience: August 2017,6-Sep-17,Big 12,Oklahoma state,5,smal scale pro stadium,"Attended my first OSU football game on the 31st.  The stadium is beautiful and on scale with a pro stadium except for the smaller size. Goodtime had by all.  The pregame and half time entertainment was spectacular!  And OSU sends a horse named bullet out after each OSU touchdown.The only two negatives are that some of the steps between rows are very large for folks with short legs!  And the conession was confusing if you were paying with cash, you got food from one line then had to stand in another line to pay.  Crazy!But it was the first home game so hopefully they will get that worked out.  Also they need more help at the consessions.  It would have been nice had they had someone in the stands selling food.Tickets kind of pricey.  But overall more good than bad."
2089,Date of experience: November 2016,15-Aug-17,Big 12,Oklahoma state,5,Great Stadium for OSU,"Having spent time in Huge stadiums it is nice to have something a little smaller and more intimate.  I recommend the game day experience at OSU to anyone interested in a fun college game experience.  This is a very open and friendly campus with some beautiful landscaping and architecture.  The school, Students and Alumni do a great job making this a fun safe experience.  Coming from a Texas Aggie with arguably the best game day experience in the nation, that is saying a lot for OSU."
2091,Date of experience: November 2016,15-Nov-16,Big 12,Oklahoma state,4,Nice Facility,"This stadium was amazing as to what it has to offer it student athletes from modern equip classrooms, to state the art workout facilities.  You would be amazed!"
2093,Date of experience: November 2016,12-Nov-16,Big 12,Oklahoma state,5,Texas Tech Game,"Great arena for football. Loud, exciting, suspenseful. Everything you need in an NCAA college football matchup. By the way Oklahoma State won 45-44. Awesome facility and campus. Great time!"
2094,Date of experience: September 2016,21-Oct-16,Big 12,Oklahoma state,5,Great Stadium for Football,"O.S.U. Football, is enjoyed by all at this stadium. Fun and entertaining watching and afternoon game."
2095,Date of experience: October 2016,14-Oct-16,Big 12,Oklahoma state,5,Fascinating place,This stadium has come a long way! Had a great time at the game. All faculty members were so generous. Great place!
2096,Date of experience: October 2016,11-Oct-16,Big 12,Oklahoma state,4,Great Overall College Football Experience,"Very Good college football venue.  Definitely better than average; however, stops short of excellent for a few reasons:  (1) You're going to park and walk, which is fine for me and my family; however, we had to park nearly a mile away, and I can imagine that being difficult for some.  (2) The crowd stood for approximately 85% of the game only taking a seat during TV time outs.  That made it extremely difficult for my children to see the game.  My kids basically watched the large screens above the crowds.  It wasn't even an exciting opponent, the Iowa State Cyclones.  The only saving grace was; as fans departed, the ability to actually see the game improved slightly.  Some positive comments:  (a) I don't think there are any horrible seats, if you can actually see over the people in front of you, and (b) The food at the stadium is more reasonably priced than most sports venues I've visited in recent years.  In fact, I recommend grabbing a bite inside the stadium as an alternative to the overcrowded eateries outside of the stadium -- on game days anyway.  I would go again.  =)"
2097,Date of experience: September 2016,4-Oct-16,Big 12,Oklahoma state,5,Great Game,Facility is nice. however the First Aid station did not have a blood pressure cuff although it had a nurse and 5 EMts
2098,Date of experience: September 2016,21-Sep-16,Big 12,Oklahoma state,5,What an AWSOME stadium,"Have had season tickets here for 20 years. Have seen it go from Rustolium Stadium to the Elite of the Big 12. Not a bad seat in the house!! The club level, a little pricy, but worth it for just 1 time."
2099,Date of experience: October 2015,3-Sep-16,Big 12,Oklahoma state,5,Beautiful new stadium!,"Game day is the pulse of Stillwater Oklahoma! Nothing better than the game, tailgate at this amazing stadium."
2100,Date of experience: December 2015,22-Aug-16,Big 12,Oklahoma state,5,OSU FOOTBALL,"Great stadium. We have had season tickets for 10 years. The south side of the stadium tends to be in the shade especially the 300 level seats. The north side is in the sun and hot! Those Sept/Oct games can be miserable on the north side in the sun! Check on season tickets because sometimes just a section over may have much less expensive seats. We have been anywhere from section 308-311 and even though we are closer to the west end zone, the views are great!"
2101,Date of experience: November 2015,15-Aug-16,Big 12,Oklahoma state,4,Excellent college experience,"I am a season ticket holder.   Visiting here is an excellent experience. I have a handicap sticker, so I take the bus near the Colvin Center, which is free, going and coming. Don't pay the high prices for parking, which can be up to $25. Come early and shop around. This place is large, and can be a pretty long walk for the elderly.   It also has limited places to rest.   The food is average, and pricey, but not as bad as some sports venues. Alcohol is not served. There are plenty of ushers to show you where your tickets are, and the views are excellent.   The seats, however, are small, and, if you are obese, you often feel like you are sitting in the person's lap next to you. Take care of restroom needs before the game because lines are long at halftime. Wear comfortable shoes. It can be a long walk around this place."
2102,Date of experience: November 2015,3-Jun-16,Big 12,Oklahoma state,5,Go COWBOYS!!!,"Well we went to a football game here and boy was it fun!!!  Great seats, and great fans! I am not from OK, nor go to OSU but the cheering and the excitment was captivating.  I left the game knowing all the chants and had an awesome time!!! As this is a college football stadium, no alcohol is served inside the before game tailgating was impressive!!!  The food inside could be better, but hey, football game = wierd hotdog so I'm not gonna complain!"
2103,Date of experience: December 2021,23-Jan-22,Big 12,TCU,5,Great New Look,This old favorite was greatly enhanced by the latest renovations. It is a great place to watch a football game.  The Founders Club Suite area is especially impressive as well as the club level dining and seating.
2104,Date of experience: December 2021,26-Dec-21,Big 12,TCU,4,Nice and Well Maintained Stadium but NOT for the handicap and horrible access.,"As for sports venues, this has to be one of the nicest I've been to in a long time. Parking and Access isn't the best though and there's only one side that's available for Elevators. This makes access for disabled people rather a chore. Besides handicap access, the next biggest two downfalls were parking which is non-existent and the fact that it's in the middle of a residential area which makes driving to rather difficult. Lighting is rather poor outside the stadium area for night games but in the main area is great. Lots of different vendors for a variety of food and drinks but be warned, everything is super expensive. This is NOT a cheap place to visit. The seating areas were very clean but the steps for the upper parts are very steep, railings are shallow and this gives you an uneasy walk up or down. Again, handicap access is NOT its strong suit. As for the facilities, this has to be one of the cleanest I've ever been in. The bathrooms were very well maintained. Overall, this was a very enjoyable experience but frustrating to access."
2105,Date of experience: September 2021,15-Sep-21,Big 12,TCU,5,Go Frogs!,"I attended my first TCU game this year and just want to say- WOW, we had so much fun! The stadium itself is big, clean, easy to navigate and contains all the amenities one would ever want at a football game. The players, students, vendors, staff and fans really bring their best to the games to make it a great experience for everyone. I love this place, especially since the TCU Horned Frogs won ; )"
2106,Date of experience: November 2020,13-Sep-21,Big 12,TCU,5,Amazing place to watch a game,"World-class stadium. As a Texas Tech alum, I will admit that this stadium blows our little Jones AT&T Stadium out of the water. It's not even an argument. And I'm not even mad about it! It is new, modern, fresh, comfortable. Everything is easily accessible and the concession options were fantastic. There are tv screens everywhere so you don't miss any of the game when you head to the restrooms (which were really clean) or to get a beer. I can honestly say that this place rivals NFL stadiums.All-in-all, it was a terrific experience! I will be coming back again.I don't like TCU at all. In fact, I kind of despise them. But I am REALLY impressed by their stadium. It does not get enough credit for being one of the better college stadiums today."
2107,Date of experience: October 2020,16-Jul-21,Big 12,TCU,5,Amazing experience in a world-class facility!,"I've been to every Big 12 stadium in the past few years, as well as about 20 other big university college football venues from Penn State to USC. Darrell K. Royal Stadium is up there amongst the worst of the Big 12 locations, along with David Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium. But Amon G. Carter Stadium is hands down the nicest and best arena, not only in the Big 12, but one of the best college gridirons I've been in, period; especially with the new luxury addition on the east side of the stadium. There are only a handful of other college venues that are better than this place.The stadium is directly across from the common area of TCU, so it is literally ON campus, as opposed to most other universities whose stadiums are located a ways off-campus. It has that open-air feel, and every seat has a great view of the field -- even the nosebleed seats. The concessions are easy to get to, and the bathrooms were spotless. I was actually amazed at how clean they were! There are two jumbotrons -- one above the north endzone, and a second, smaller screen near the south endzone between where the band sits, and the endzone. The entire facility is built with a really attractive exterior facade that is a beige-ish colored brick. I've never seen anything like it! Best of all, the atmosphere was electric. There were pre-game tailgating parties EVERYWHERE. I saw custom-painted TCU trucks and buses, massive BBQ setups, and tons of huge tent-covered tailgate spots with full spreads of every food imaginable, big-screen TVs and live surround stereo systems, with generators powering everything. You could walk from tailgate to tailgate, and everybody was so open and inviting. At the front of the stadium, there was an entire front lawn party, highlighted by the band marching in, and the Superfrog mascot greeting the fans. The area was aptly named ""Frog Alley."" Traffic was heavy and congested on the main road by the stadium, but it was directed well by police. There were even charter buses that brought people to and from the stadium, and dropped them off right in front of the main lawn.During the game, the band played loud and enthusiastically, and it seemed that every attendee knew the TCU cheers and the fight song. The whole stadium erupted in a ""RAH RAH TCU!"" chant anytime the fight song was played.All that to say that the stadium is fantastic! It is such a beautiful, well-designed structure, which was amplified by the in-game experience. I would 10/10 recommend anybody to this stadium. You won't regret it!"
2108,Date of experience: January 2020,4-Jan-20,Big 12,TCU,2,Bad seats!,Nice stadium.   However the seats have the seat numbers riveted on and an incomplete rivet was stickingout and punched a hole in my bend new jacket!  Can't find a place on any of the TCU  websites to notify them that this is an issue.   Watch where you sit!
2109,Date of experience: November 2019,10-Nov-19,Big 12,TCU,5,Go Horned Frogs,This was my first college game and it was an amazing experience. The stadium is huge and the fireworks and Jumbotron with the music had me dancing. My bottled water was a great price especially when I was thinking it was gonna be high. Bathrooms clean and not that crowded I was shocked. Great experience!!
2110,Date of experience: November 2018,11-Aug-19,Big 12,TCU,5,Great stadium,"I grew up going to this stadium back in the day TCU was consistently one of the worst teams in the country.  I have a nostalgic no apologies attitude about how great this place is.  I'm a Longhorn fan 1st, but this stadium is so much better than theirs and most mega stadiums.  It is a perfect size without a bad seat in the house.  The perfect mix of an old historic stadium with a perfect modern update.  It is the perfect college football scene."
2112,Date of experience: December 2018,18-Feb-19,Big 12,TCU,3,Home of Texas Christian University football,Parking in the area is a nightmare unless you arrive very early. The staff is friendly and helpful. The concourse is not good for the flow of foot traffic. There are numerous concession stands throughout the facility. All seating is aluminum bleachers. The stadium does have good sight lines. Getting out of the place is another nightmare.
2113,Date of experience: December 2018,3-Jan-19,Big 12,TCU,3,"Sell some beer, improve the food, work on the traffic congestion, build a parking garage, and I will give you a 5!","We attended the Armed Services Bowl to watch the University of Houston play (ha, ha, they did not!!) Army.  We lost 14 to 70, so it was a complete disaster (football-wise) for our team.But, the stadium (our first visit) was really nice.  In fact, the most comfortable stadium we have ever been in as far as leg room goes (Section 104, Row L, Seats 19-20).  These seats also had a long thin table in front of us with drink holders.  The table was a bit far away in terms of reach, but this also provided for more leg room, so that was more important.On this particular day, it was very, very, very cold.  And....we were on the shady side.  So, we were miserable, even though (one of us) was appropriately dressed.  The ceremonies performed at the game were awesome (parachuters (5), helicopters, an eagle in flight, the unrolling of the football field size American flag on the field).  These ceremonies alone were worth the visit.  But, alas, as noted before, our team was losing miserably.  Worst bowl game of any college football team in 2018.  Between the cold and the losing team, we ended up leaving after halftime, which we don't normally do, BUT, the stadium does not sell beer!!!  If we could have drowned our sorrows in a couple of beers, we might have ""weathered it"" (no kidding) to the very end.But, here is the not so good (needs improvement) about the stadium (despite the great seating arrangements we had).The food we had from three different places in the stadium....all were not good.  We only ate it because we were hungry.BTW - the traffic getting there was awful!  We decided to Uber because we did not know where we were going.  Fortunately for us, our Uber driver was a graduate of TCU!  (Why a TCU grad is driving for Uber, I know not.)  So, he knew where he was going!!  And it was still a bear!  Because there seems to be very limited parking, people in residences around the stadium let folks park on their lawns.  (That's real pretty.)  There were people directing traffic, but it did not seem to be working.So, sell some beer, make better food, work on traffic organization, build a parking garage, and I will give the stadium a ""5"".  Even if our team loses again."
2114,Date of experience: November 2018,29-Dec-18,Big 12,TCU,4,Well Designed for Access and Viewing,"Attended this year's and last year's Armed Forces Bowl at AGC Stadium. We found it easy to get to and around. Well done for tailgating just outside the stadium. LMCO, TCU workers and stadium hosts were all gracious and accommodating. We sat in seating on east side last year but in club seating on west side this year. Of course, the club seats were especially comfortable. Great viewing from both! Also, kudos to University Baptist church nearby who raise funds by allowing parking at their lot. However, they allow veterans to park for free!! Good on you!! Much appreciated!"

2116,Date of experience: November 2018,6-Nov-18,Big 12,TCU,5,Go Frogs,"Regardless if you a Horned Frog or not, a TCU football game is a fun way to spend the afternoon/evening if you are in town on a home game Saturday. Lively atmosphere, variety of snacks, great band. You can usually find some kind of give away while you are there (a free soda, a banner, etc.)."
2117,Date of experience: November 2018,6-Nov-18,Big 12,TCU,5,Go Frogs,Great football place to go and watch the game. Makes you feel at home even if you are not a TCU fan.
2118,Date of experience: October 2018,24-Oct-18,Big 12,TCU,5,nice stadium,Came down for the OU vs TCU game. Nice facilities. I liked that the bench seats had backs to them! that is definitely a bonus!!! Enjoyed our trip!
2119,Date of experience: October 2018,21-Oct-18,Big 12,TCU,5,Nice Stadium,Got free tickets to Saturday's game against Oklahoma. First game attended in the new stadium. They did a great job. There are no obstructed sight lines and concession choices are more numerous. Our Horned Frogs lost but we still had a good time. Plan your parking well ahead of game day.
2120,Date of experience: December 2017,3-Oct-18,Big 12,TCU,4,Perfect spot!,Only downside we've found is that parking is sparse at times so pay for it ahead of time to guarantee your spot in one of the garages. We attend the Armed Forces Bowl every year and enjoy every moment - stadium is well thought out and easy to access every seat with views of the field.
2121,Date of experience: August 2018,13-Sep-18,Big 12,TCU,5,New stadium is great,Texas Christian University's home field is perfect for the horned frogs great team Go Horned Frogs!!!
2122,Date of experience: December 2017,18-Jan-18,Big 12,TCU,2,Standing water in our seats,"We bought tickets for the Armed Forces Bowl, hosted by ESPN.  Paid a premium price to get front row tickets, only to find an inch of standing water at our seats.  With cold temperatures and my girlfriend wearing flats, we were unable to sit in the seat.  The users were not sure what to do.  Customer service was not available for most of the first quarter.  When she finally returned at the end of the first quarter, she offered to move me to the other side of the stadium about 20 rows from the field.  We did not want to sit on the other teams side, especially that far away from the field when we paid a premium price for front row seats on the Army side.  Luckily a sympathetic family a few rows behind our seat allowed us to squeeze in with them.UPDATE:  ESPN (who sold the tickets) told me that do not offer refunds, but would give me a credit for next years game.  Not sure I'll be able to attend, but am weary about going back to a stadium with poor maintenance/drainage issues."
2123,Date of experience: November 2017,1-Jan-18,Big 12,TCU,4,Clean venue,We used the local church transit to the stadium which was very nice. We got to the clean venue for a nice pregame atmosphere. Inside the layout is a great setup to big games. The additions from many years ago well done
2124,Date of experience: November 2017,25-Dec-17,Big 12,TCU,4,Senior Day 2017,"We went to the Baylor game  for our first TCU game. We took the free shuttle from the Baptist Church and was dropped off directly in front of the stadium. I??d suggest to get there early to see the band marching in and see the Frog Alley pre-game party. Inside, they have plenty of concession choices. The crowd gets in to it and they have a lot of in game entertainment..I love the ??hypno toad?? when the opposing team attempts a field goal."
2125,Date of experience: October 2016,5-Sep-17,Big 12,TCU,5,Excellent game day experience,"Visited for first time last October for a TCU game.  The game was good, the band was good but I was most impressed by the overall experience.  The stadium is easily accessible and there are concession stands conveniently located at every level.  The sound system is one of the better ones I have heard at a university with the announcer clear and crisp.  You will have a good time whether you are for TCU or the visiting team."
2127,Date of experience: October 2016,21-Jul-17,Big 12,TCU,5,Excellent mid-size stadium,TCU did a great job of replacing their old stadium.  The new stadium is well deisgned for fans both in the seating area and under the stands.  Because parking is limited they have done a good job of arranging for buses to local parking lots.
2128,Date of experience: October 2016,6-Apr-17,Big 12,TCU,5,College football in a refined Texas style,"The Horned Frogs know how to have a good time without being obnoxious. Kids stand throughout the game, girls wear dresses and cowboy boots and then theres the train horn when the team scores. College football like it was intended ."
2129,Date of experience: October 2016,19-Jan-17,Big 12,TCU,5,Texas Tech game,"Really enjoyed the atmosphere and the game, a very relaxed and open game.  Excellent organisation for getting to and from the stadium in buses back to event parking."

Crowd is friendly , frog alley ( vendors ) lot of cheap give aways ( key chains etc??)  good concession stands flame grilled burgers even serve  chick fil a ! The West side of stadium is an oven on warm days ( day games ) . Best parking is  using a shuttle , unless you are in donor parking. Small stadium so all seat are pretty darn good ! GO FROGS !!"
2131,Date of experience: December 2016,3-Jan-17,Big 12,TCU,5,Amon G. Carter Stadium Armed Forces Bowl,TCU hosts were so helpful and amazing!  Game even better that we (La Tech) won over Army!  The stadium chair-back seating was roomy and comfortable.
2132,Date of experience: December 2016,26-Dec-16,Big 12,TCU,4,2016 Armed Forces Bowl,"Older stadium with character. The stadium is TCU's home field and has that seats with their logo. When we went they would not let seat cushions to be taken in ,,so that not very good because most of the stadium was bench seats."
2133,Date of experience: December 2016,25-Dec-16,Big 12,TCU,4,2016 Armed Forces Bowl Game 12/23,We were in Fort Worth to attend the 2016 Armed Services Football Bowl game and managed to go through at least some of the TCU campus besides just the football stadium.It appears to be a very nice campus and the stadium was very attratctive and we had good viewing from our seats in the stands. There is a large big screen video board at the north end of the stadium and a smaller one at the southeast end. A nice game day experience all around.
2134,Date of experience: December 2016,24-Dec-16,Big 12,TCU,5,Armed Forces Bowl,"The stadium itself was very nice.  Just about all seating had backs, even if it was bench seating.  We were in Section 306 and had individual seats.  They were a bit tight, like airline seats, but at least you down need to bring your own stadium chair. My only complaint would be that they did not open all the concession stands for this game, so our food choices were limited."
2135,Date of experience: October 2016,16-Nov-16,Big 12,TCU,5,A Gem of Fort Worth in the Cultural District,"Listed as American Art and you will not be disappointed...!!  Russell and Remington, Moran and many, many more.  Free admission.  I enjoyed the special exhibit Border Cantos. Taken from there web page:  ""In this unusual artistic collaboration, photographer Richard Misrach and experimental composer Guillermo Galindo joined the forces of their respective media to document the unseen, human reality of the US-Mexico borderlands."
2136,Date of experience: October 2016,20-Oct-16,Big 12,TCU,5,First College game,Wow not a lot to say about the concrete bowl of the stadium. But the cameraderie between alumni and current students and welcoming atmosphere left me feeling a real sense of family.Travelling from the UK would love to come back. Go Horned Frogs
2137,Date of experience: October 2016,4-Oct-16,Big 12,TCU,5,GO FROGS!,"This is our second year visiting the stadium and seeing the TCU football team play, which is going to be a yearly tradition.  What a great experience!Om:  Why is this going to be a yearly tradition?  Because it??s a GREAT experience to see the TCU football team play their games in this wonderful stadium!!!  It??s super clean, there are great sightlines regardless of where you sit, and the crowds are great.  Parking has not been an issue either time we have went because there are a good number of lots within a few miles that offer parking (some free!) with shuttles to and from the game.  The game day experience has been wonderful, lots of tailgating and other activities going on right outside the stadium, giving it that genuine college feel.  Make sure that you sit on the ??home?? side if given the option for an afternoon game so you don??t have the sun blasting you throughout!  Nom and I really enjoy our time here, especially on an Autumn day when it??s not too hot out.  GO FROGS!Nom:  What a wonderful adventure to travel out to a TCU game!  In the big scheme of things it??s not a bad drive and the campus is absolutely beautiful.  The stadium is really a gem on their campus, something to really be proud of!  It??s super clean, and you can see the field from any vantage point in the seats.  If you sit in the seats, I can??t speak for the bleacher section, they are actually comfortable!  Parking is really a non-issue because you can find either a lot that charges a fee within walking distance or park for free and take a free shuttle that will drop you off right across from the stadium at the student union!    If you sit on the ??home?? side you can get a great view of all the students in their section plus the sun will be out of your eyes! ?  I love our new tradition and can??t wait to go back with my handsome love!!  GO FROGS!!"
2138,Date of experience: September 2016,14-Sep-16,Big 12,TCU,4,Nice Stadium but the CLIMB!,If you sit at the top... good grief the angle of the stairs.  But the food and people are great for visitors.  Was a nice stadium.
2139,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,Big 12,TCU,5,Football game,We love our season tickets on the fifty yard line our backs against a wall and in the shade. Patterson is the best and we always enjoy the games. Go frogs!
2140,Date of experience: September 2016,11-Sep-16,Big 12,TCU,4,Great stadium,"Our seats we a little high but as the visiting team, we expect that. We were in the shade and I loved that. I really love the fact that we had seat backs and that made sitting more comfortable. The didn't allow stadium seats do my behind did get a bit sore. My biggest problem here was the sign at the stadium that said I had to have a clear purse.  This was not noted on th he ticket and I understand the reasoning behind it. However,  it would have taken a lot of time to return to the car and leave my purse. I did something that I am not proud of; I bullied my way in with my fanny pack. No one said anything to me. If I ever go back to a game. I will not bring purse."
2141,Date of experience: September 2016,6-Sep-16,Big 12,TCU,5,Awesome!!,Tcu games are an event very fun for the whole family! Parking is rough and either very expensive or very far away but it's a football game. High prices inside the stadium on food and other items as to be expected so find a vendor outside or eat drink before you come in. It's a great experience though we will definitely come back.
2142,Date of experience: October 2015,29-Aug-16,Big 12,TCU,5,WHAT A GREAT PLACE,This is one of the nicest stadiums I have been to. Plenty of parking and easy to access. The seating is very good. Go to a game if you get a chance ITS FUN
2143,Date of experience: November 2015,7-Aug-16,Big 12,TCU,5,2015 Baylor at TCU  great weather for a football game Frogs won.,"Always a great experience at Amon Carter Stadium. Historical Field Sammy Baugh and Bob Lilly played on but now the 1930s art deco look is done with the modern infrastructure. Not a bad seat in the house, including when you are in the areas to and from the restrooms."
2144,Date of experience: December 2015,27-May-16,Big 12,TCU,5,Love this place!,"I received free tickets for the Armed Forces Bowl a few years ago. I loved this stadium! There are maps, ample seating and parking, and they have free posters and activities for kids!"
2145,Date of experience: October 2015,25-Apr-16,Big 12,TCU,4,Can't beat College Football,I used to usher TCU games when I was a Boy Scout in the '60s.Visited the new stadium in 2015 to see Texas v TCU game.Great college atmosphere inside the renovated stadium and outside across the beautiful campus.
2146,Date of experience: November 2015,2-Apr-16,Big 12,TCU,5,What a great improvement,"We saw the stadium before, saw the implosion, watched it being rebuilt and saw the finished product and it just gets better."
2147,Date of experience: November 2015,24-Mar-16,Big 12,TCU,4,Great updates to the stadium,"The university and fans deserved the upgraded stadium and they delivered; along with a good football team each year, it's worth the visit"
2148,Date of experience: December 2015,16-Mar-16,Big 12,TCU,5,Best stadium in the Big 12,"Come watch the Horned Frogs win in their modern new home. It is a proud and comfortable home for the Horned Frogs and their fans and ""Hells Half Acre"" for their opponents. Great architecture, abundant concessions, good food, spacious concourses, make this a wonderful home for one of the nations winningest teams."
2149,Date of experience: September 2015,13-Mar-16,Big 12,TCU,5,Great place to watch a game,"Nice venue, very comfortable.  Can involve a bit of walking to get to upper seats (limited escalator / elevator options).  Good site lines, fun crowd.  Parking can be a but challenging, and you may have to walk."
2150,Date of experience: December 2015,13-Mar-16,Big 12,TCU,4,Armed Forces Bowl,"We walked through a considerable amount of construction on the way from the parking lot to the field. Outside of that, the campus is pretty. The stadium was nice. People were friendly. Food was venue priced. It was a chilly day, great for football. I would go again."
2151,Date of experience: November 2015,28-Feb-16,Big 12,TCU,3,Older Stadium - lots of character,"Visited the stadium on a very cold and rainy day so my experience may not be the average.   The home stands have a huge upper level that is very high for a stadium holding only 50K people.  Food offerings were fairly basic.  The south end of the stadium opens to an older building with some interesting architecture, which was somewhat interesting. The field is grass, and it could benefit from some newer field turf.  The game I visited was muddy slogfest and both TCU and their opponent were so far removed from their normal games that the game was not enjoyable.   Sight lines are good from most parts of the stadium.  The TCU siren looks like a Zamboni machine and in addition to being annoying, it would have been more useful as an actual zamboni on that night. Free parking is available for TCU games within a short walk, so that was something positive."
2152,Date of experience: October 2015,17-Feb-16,Big 12,TCU,5,Great day at the stadium with my son,"While walking around the stadium with my son dressed in our Kansas University hats and jackets a least three dressed in purple people stopped to say thank you for coming to our stadium. They had no  idea we may have went to Kansas to get our degree we only live a short distance from the stadium. But they are the most friendly people of any college town We have ever visited. It is a great stadium to see a ball game in,we go to a couple of games a year here but we always dress in our Jayhawk blue for this one game and our team always looses badly but to get beat by a team with such a friendly fans is almost painless."
2153,Date of experience: December 2015,31-Dec-15,Big 12,TCU,4,AWESOME Stadium...parking?,"Attended Armed Forces Bowl 2016Enjoyed the pre-game activities in the North parking lot.Getting there several hours early to secure parking...not such a great experience.  You need a pass.  So, we lucked out and parked in a neighbor's yard that charged $40.  It was well worth it.The stadium itself is AWESOME, not a bad seat in the house.  Large concourse.Looking forward to seeing more games at this venue."
2154,Date of experience: December 2015,29-Dec-15,Big 12,TCU,5,Unique college venue,"I have been to many college football stadiums, primarily in the SEC and this one is very cool.  Not the biggest, but one of the most exciting."
2155,Date of experience: November 2015,24-Nov-15,Big 12,TCU,5,Stadium,Great place to what a sporting event. There is not a bad seat in the house. It could use a few more shaded areas.
2156,Date of experience: November 2015,18-Nov-15,Big 12,TCU,5,What a Stadium!!!!  GREAT Experience!,"Om:  What a great first time experience this was! I can only rant and rave about EVERYTHING!  The sightlines were great, the people were friendly, the stadium is located right on campus and is sizeable yet cozy, the ticket prices are reasonable as long as it??s not a big rivalry game, the concessions were reasonable priced??just everything was outstanding.  There was a lot of activity outside the stadium on game day as well, from tailgating to free swag to stuff for the kids, there was something for everyone.  Parking was no problem, though I do suggest you get there at least an hour early just to be sure.  We took one of the free shuttles, and it was only about a 10 minute ride to the stadium.  As a side note, the campus was beautiful!  We will definitely go back to another game, and are even looking into season tickets!  Nom, what are your thoughts?Nom:  I have to say I was totally blown away with the TCU stadium!  My handsome love it right!  We can only rave about EVERYTHING!  I think I would have been hard pressed to find a place where the field was hard to see.  They set it up so that you can catch a free, that??s right FREE shuttle to the stadium!  There was a ton of stuff going on outside the stadium with live music and a bounce house area for kids, vendors giving away free stuff and a sea of PURPLE!!!  If you don??t want to be rushed catch the shuttle at least an hour before kickoff.  We got to walk around a bit and they had a beautiful common area with a bronze fountain that was just lovely.  You can tell there is a lot of pride at this school and I can??t wait to go back to visit for another football game or to take in some college basketball!!"
2157,Date of experience: November 2015,13-Nov-15,Big 12,TCU,5,One of the best stadiums in College Football,"Amon Carter is one of the most beautiful football stadiums in America. There are no bad sight lines in the building and the Frogs fans draw a passionate fan base. They call it the ""Camden Yards"" of College Football for a reason. The tailgating scene is quality, but not SEC strong. If you are in DFW for a home football game, be sure to get tickets. Note: Buy your tickets early!"
2158,Date of experience: November 2015,10-Nov-15,Big 12,TCU,5,TCU FOOTBALL,This is a terrific venue with an extraordinary football team. Go Frogs!!!  The TCU campus is beautiful and close to many restaurants and establishments.
2159,Date of experience: September 2015,5-Oct-15,Big 12,TCU,5,First Visit - TCU and Longhorn Game,"First visit, TCU and Longhorns - Beautiful Stadium....pretty easy to get an Uber in and out if you go the back way from Colonial Country Club (Rodgers Street) turn right on Parkhill and turn left on Stadium Drive."
2160,Date of experience: September 2015,21-Sep-15,Big 12,TCU,5,Horned Frog Pride!,"There is not a nicer Big XII stadium out there! The new Amon G Carter stadium is home to the nationally recognized TCU Horned Frogs. If you have the opportunity to visit you will be impressed with all the great seating, jumbo tron, good concessions and friendly fans. A must see on your visit to Ft. Worth."
2161,Date of experience: September 2015,19-Sep-15,Big 12,TCU,5,Great stadium & fans,I went to SMU but you have to ?????? TCU.  The stadium is beautiful.  Great tailgating and family fun in Frog Alley.  Good times had by all!
2162,Date of experience: August 2015,11-Aug-15,Big 12,TCU,5,Beautiful Stadium!,"While strolling around the campus, we thought we would check out Amon G Carter Stadium to see where the Horned Frogs play. I must say this stadium is beautifully built and looks perfect for a tailgate/home game. I thought the stadium would be larger in size, but with recently joining the Big 12, I can see it only growing bigger and I'd love to come back and watch a home game (even though I'm not a TCU fan)."
2163,Date of experience: August 2015,5-Aug-15,Big 12,TCU,5,Horned Frog Heaven!,"Home of the Horned Frogs of TCU is rivaled only by ""Jerry World"" in Arlington (but then OUR house is much more intimate/cozy). A PERFECT setting for college football!"
2164,Date of experience: October 2014,7-Jul-15,Big 12,TCU,3,Amon Carter Stadium,"This is an example of a small program going big.  Once a bottom ten team, the Frogs are now a powerhouse in the conference and the nation.  Amon Carter is suitable for this fine young team.  Unfortunately in a recent make over, the seating of this once comfortably confined stadium was changed to accomidate more cupholders than bottoms."
2165,Date of experience: October 2014,30-Jun-15,Big 12,TCU,5,A gem of a stadium,"TCU made alums and fans alike proud with a magnificent renovation of a stadium that was not much more than serviceable in its previous incarnation. The school and city deserved so much more. They got it. The new Amon Carter Stadium opened in 2012, just as the Frogs joined the Big 12 Conference, and is one of the best places in the league to watch a football game. It has a beautiful Art Deco design that preserves the best elements of the original stadium. It's relatively small, but the seats are close to the field, making it an intimidating place for road teams to visit."
2166,Date of experience: October 2014,25-Jun-15,Big 12,TCU,5,Great venue,Football games at TCU and A. G. Carter Stadium are a Ft. Worth stand out.  The new stadium is convenient and beautiful.  The pre game activities and the abundance of tailgaters make even the parking lot fun
2169,Date of experience: December 2014,18-Feb-15,Big 12,TCU,5,Great stadium,"Not the largest, but very top-notch.  Like a Ferrari instead of the Surbuban at the big state universities."
2170,Date of experience: December 2013,16-Sep-14,Big 12,TCU,4,Tcu does it the right way,"Great setup for a college game.  TCU does it right.  We are gophers fans and actually went to a TCU vs. West Virginia game.  The ushers were a bit of a nag and that??s why I am giving it 1 star off.   We have bleacher seats on the 50 yard line the very last row.  They wouldn??t allow us to step up to our spots,  they made us use the aisle and bug people that we sitting down to get up so we could squeeze by to get to our spot.  Again we were the last row so we wouldn??t have had to bother anyone and just took a minor step up to our spots.   Walk way was big,  there is an ok space for tailgating but nothing big.   The fans were friendly.  The nice part about TCU is that they pack their student section tight behind the bench of the opposing team.  If the crowd is in it and loud makes it very difficult for the opposing team to communicate."
2171,Date of experience: December 2013,31-Dec-13,Big 12,TCU,5,Beautiful Facility,"We visited Amon G. Carter Stadium for the Armed Forces Bowl and were very impressed. The stadium is beautiful and includes two jumbotrons as well. Concession prices were expensive, but that's what you expect at sporting events these days...Overall this was a very cool stadium on a beautiful campus and I would definitely like to visit again when the stadium is filled to capacity!"
2172,Date of experience: November 2013,2-Dec-13,Big 12,TCU,5,Fantastic Facility,I watched the TCU vs Baylor game at the TCU Stadium.  What a great place. We sat in the end zone closest to the train horn (you will know what I mean when you are there).  It was very easy getting in and out of the stadium. It was very clean and the sightlines were fantastic.  Would love it if my college team had a stadium like this one.
2173,Date of experience: December 2013,1-Dec-13,Big 12,TCU,5,Wow! Go to Colege Game without all the traffic!,What a great experience - the concessions were excellent and every thing was very clean. Clearly - management has their act together!
2174,Date of experience: October 2013,17-Nov-13,Big 12,TCU,4,A Great Place To Watch College Football,"I recently attended the Texas vs. TCU football game, and the experience was great (except for the 3 hour rain delay).  The newly renovated stadium was a wonderful venue for a game, and the home team fans were friendly.With the newest upgrades Texas Christian University has made, the Stadium now seats about 48,000 fans.  While growing, this is still significantly less than other Big XII schools.  However, the more intimate atmosphere makes the action feel even closer.Parking is not easy to find around the Stadium; however, free shuttles are offered from locations around Fort Worth.  I found this to be very convenient."
2175,Date of experience: October 2013,5-Nov-13,Big 12,TCU,5,This Place Puts Many Pro Stadiums To Shame!,Everything about this modern stadium is first class. Makes one wish they were among the rich alumni with the suites!  General seating isn't bad though. Go Frogs!
2176,Date of experience: October 2013,27-Oct-13,Big 12,TCU,4,Beautiful stadium!,"My wife and I attended a football game between Texas and TCU. The parking situation was odd. There must be a public parking area somewhere, but not knowing, this, we followed signs on the side of the road which led to residential areas. There was parking there, but it was homeowners charging for parking in their front yards. We ended up parking along the street a bit farther out. The walk wasn't too bad. The stadium itself is very nice. Being Texas fans, we were greeting very nicely by the staff at the gate, welcoming us to TCU. All the seats have back rests, which is nice. Unfortunately there was a lightning delay, which was announced, and then it proceeded to rain heavily. Knowing that thunderstorms were in the area, the staff should have been better prepared for crowd control. It took a good 15 minutes to get out of the stands, so we were soaked. I think what happened was that all the people were getting piled up with nowhere to go, so we were at a stand still for most of the time. The security and others should have been directing people where to go from the start. If there was an emergency, I don't know if we would have made it out. That being said, I hope they learned something from it. The delay lasted 3 hours, but they had the World Series on TV by the snack bar, while we were just standing around. Unfortunately, being cold and wet, we waited for the rain to let up, and had to leave the game before it restarted."
2177,Date of experience: October 2013,18-Oct-13,Big 12,TCU,5,Amon Carter Stadium is a great venue to view event,While the East side  may at times be very hit due to the Sun it is a great place to see the field. TCU should offer free water or let you take water into stadium on excessive temperature games
2178,Date of experience: November 2012,16-Oct-13,Big 12,TCU,4,Very Nice Stadium,The Texas Christian University Horn Frogs now have a very nice place to play their home field football games at.  The stadium has been totally redone and added on to.  It's a wonderful place to go see a great team play the game.
2180,Date of experience: November 2012,23-Apr-13,Big 12,TCU,4,Great New Stadium,"As an alum of TCU and a season ticket holder for nearly 40 years, I was aware of the need to update our old Amon Carter Stadium.  I have to say, TCU outdid themselves.  Thanks to some very generous donors, TCU now has one of the premier football facilities in the country.  If you can get a ticket, it is a great place to watch a game.  Only negative that I can see is that it is quite a hike to the top deck on the west side."
2181,Date of experience: September 2012,8-Mar-13,Big 12,TCU,5,Magnificient stadium,The new TCU Amon Carter Stadium is one of the best in the nation.  Great sight lines throughout....it was built to watch football.
2182,Date of experience: August 2012,3-Mar-13,Big 12,TCU,5,Worth it,"The energy @ a TCU event is always high, but now that the new stadium is completed, it has raised it's level. It is worth fighting the masses just to sit in the stadium. Be careful though, since on the higher levels, the railing is not high enough in my opinion. I am not looking forward to the day that a drunk college kid plunges over the rail."
2183,Date of experience: November 2012,25-Feb-13,Big 12,TCU,4,TCU alum who is proud of the new stadium,"I am a TCU alum who loved the ""old"" Amon Carter Stadium. I was not sure how I would feel about the ""new"" stadium.  I have to say that I am thrilled with the renovations. The stadium is much easier to navigate, and the food stands are MUCH nicer!"
2184,Date of experience: November 2012,25-Jan-13,Big 12,TCU,5,What a Beautiful Stadium!!!,"Since the remodel, this is a ""First Class College Stadium""----nationally!!!Go see a football game in this stadium----if you can get a ticket!  It's beautiful!!!"
2185,Date of experience: December 2012,30-Dec-12,Big 12,TCU,5,Bowl game,Great stadium great game great atmosphere. Only problem was you can't bring in seat cushions. Food was pretty good.
2187,Date of experience: December 2012,4-Dec-12,Big 12,TCU,4,Modern and intimate football stadium.,"We scouted out our parking lot the day before and wound through the nice neighborhoods NE of the stadium to avoid traffic. The stadium itself is new and modern. Seats are close to the field. Plus, the Sooners won so it was a very hospitable experience!"
2188,Date of experience: September 2021,24-Jul-22,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Great College Football Experience.,"One of the best gameday atmospheres in the nation.  For BIG 12 conference games this place can be ear splitting.  Very loud.   Fans are engaged, passionate and courteous if they are not provoked.  Parking can be difficult as most close parking lots are used for a one of the best Tailgating I have seen on a college campus.  They do have round trip shuttle busses from satellite lots for a good value.  Ck the Tech athletic website for lots and price.  Also they have concessions with extensive menus.  Not just hot dogs and popcorn."
2189,Date of experience: November 2021,19-Nov-21,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Great Facility,I was nervous to attend a game at what was for a me a very large college stadium but it was great-you do not have a ton of stairs and it was easy to get in and out. Very clean and well maintained.
2190,Date of experience: September 2021,4-Sep-21,Big 12,Texas tech,1,Disgusting!,"Couldn??t find the Kris Wilson Fearless Campion Arena - so I??m posting here.Came for a cutting horse event. The arena is the nastiest place I??ve been in, wouldn??t keep my horse here. It was difficult to sit in the stands with the bird crap and years of filth everywhere. Maybe a hose and water would help. I seriously  doubt this place has ever been cleaned.I get it, it??s basically a barn- however one can only imagine the diseases that live in this place!Will not repeat visit, nor ever recommend to my friends with horses."
2191,Date of experience: November 2019,13-Feb-20,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Amazing atmosphere!,Get there early so you can catch one of the best traditions in sports when the Masked Rider sprints across the field to bring the players on to the field.
2193,Date of experience: November 2019,28-Dec-19,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Great Stadium,The stadium has been expanded and upgraded since we first visited there 5 years ago.  The seating is good and the restaurant /club is great.  The main drawback is the lack of parking adjacent to the stadium.
2194,Date of experience: September 2019,1-Dec-19,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Great venue!,Had a blast at Techs home opener. Kudos for having not just beer but craft beer at the stadium. Don't have to load up while tailgating any longer! Bonus points for the Tech win!
2195,Date of experience: October 2019,7-Oct-19,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Very nice college football stadium,"Very nice stadium, the stadium club has excellent food and the suites are comfortable and spacious. I have attended games seated in a suite and in the lower stadium seats. They have good consession food and beer."
2196,Date of experience: October 2019,6-Oct-19,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Parent weekend,"Went to watch the football game. The venue and atmosphere is incredible.  Seating is a little cramped, but it adds to the atmosphere. Beer and snacks were good and reasonably priced."
2197,Date of experience: October 2019,6-Oct-19,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Parent??s Weekend,A fun venue. Plenty of fast food and beer is now offered. Seating is tight though for the cost of the ticket. Clean and safe.
2198,Date of experience: October 2018,31-Mar-19,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Football.....,If you've never been to Jones Stadium for a football game then you haven't seen true Texas football. Jones Stadium if haunted with rich Texas Tech football history. It was recently updated. Go Texas Tech Football
2199,Date of experience: August 2018,13-Dec-18,Big 12,Texas tech,5,fun football,always fun to take people to the ball game and this is a newly remodeled stadium with a very good restaurant
2200,Date of experience: November 2018,20-Nov-18,Big 12,Texas tech,4,Good Place to see your favorite team for a good price,This stadium is large enough to hoist some very good teams. All the Big 12 teams play here at some point. The stadium is not so large that its hard to find a good seat. In fact there is really not a bad seat in the house. You can see the game from anywhere. The pricing is about half of some of the other big schools.
2201,Date of experience: November 2018,3-Nov-18,Big 12,Texas tech,1,Worst Fans in America,Never go to a game here. The fans will curse you and even verbally attack your children. They throw things at you the entire game. Security is nonexistent. Avoid this place- it is extremely dangerous for visiting fans. I??ve been to at least 6 games here- never again.
2202,Date of experience: October 2018,30-Oct-18,Big 12,Texas tech,1,Worst fans in the nation,"Texas Tech has the worst fans in the nation. I guess they are angry because Lubbock is an awful place to live. They curse at children, throw things at fans and have no class at all. Everyone has bad fans but Tech takes it to another level, I would be ashamed to have the reputation they have. Be warned it is a horrible place to visit."
2203,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Oct-18,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Tailgater,If you love tailgating this is the place for you! Everyone is friendly and always willing to stop and talk.
2204,Date of experience: September 2018,20-Sep-18,Big 12,Texas tech,5,TTU vs UH,"This venue is a great place to watch the game. The venue is constantly changing, and growing. The stadium has a new Jumbotron, which makes it nice if everyone is standing and visibility is tough to to spectators. I would highly, highly, highly recommend sitting on the home teams side. The visitors side is always in the sun. Clean restrooms, and a great place to cheer on the Red Raiders!"
2205,Date of experience: September 2017,22-Dec-17,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Go Red Raiders,"This stadium is where Texas Tech's football team plays all home games. Lubbock is a hot bed of loyal, supportive Red Raider fans. The stadium is constantly improved to stay up with the best facilities in the Big 12 Conference and other major facilities. It has suites and an upscale private restaurant overlooking the field. The food at the restaurant is exquisite. Security is a high priority, and you cannot take in a purse, backpack, umbrella, etc. You can take in a clear plastic tote bag available at local and area merchants. Unless you have a parking pass for close parking, it is a good walk from parking to the stadium. Texas Tech is proud of their stadium and all of its venues and facilities. Go Tech!"
2206,Date of experience: September 2017,24-Oct-17,Big 12,Texas tech,4,TTU vs OSU,"This place is a very nice, clean college stadium. The jumbo tron is largest in the Big 12. The crowd was great with lots of tailgating on campus and beyond. Lots of fun watching a game there. Make sure to get tickets where you can see the jumbo tron.  Vehicle and pedestrian traffic control was well managed. Can't wait to go to another game."
2207,Date of experience: September 2017,3-Sep-17,Big 12,Texas tech,4,"Parking is way away, but a good stadium with good sight lines",Went to the Tech game here over the weekend. Stadium has fast elevators and good sight lines and has a nice intimate feel. Food here is very average. Popcorn is not freshly popped and comes from a bag. The fountain soda tastes metallic. The people are nice.
2209,Date of experience: November 2016,26-Jun-17,Big 12,Texas tech,4,Nice Stadium,"Home of the Red Raiders.  The seats are good.  The Food is nice and the restrooms are clean.  Overall, this is a place to watch some decent football.  It gets crazy hot during  early season day games."
2210,Date of experience: August 2016,9-May-17,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Go Red Raiders,"What a nice place to watch football. Nice location, clean and easy to get around. I will be back to watch UT win again."
2211,Date of experience: November 2016,28-Apr-17,Big 12,Texas tech,5,FOOTBALL--Texas Style,"Everything is bigger in Texas, including our renown football games at Texas Tech.  Come out at watch those Red Raiders triumph (we hope.)  Visit the tailgate tent and enjoy your favorite foods--especially our great Texas Bar-B- Que.  Coming to Lubbockj in the fall?  Don't miss the Jones Stadium and the Texas Tex Red Raiders!"
2212,Date of experience: October 2016,2-Apr-17,Big 12,Texas tech,4,its a stadium,Not much to say about this place its a football stadium of the texas tech red raiders.  Its a pretty decent stadium but afterall it is just a stadium.
2214,Date of experience: November 2016,17-Jan-17,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Texas Tech Guns up!!,We went to the Texas Tech  vs. Texas Longhorns game in November and had the best time. This was my second time attending a Tech game and the fans are just amazing. Such a fun experience!
2215,Date of experience: October 2016,14-Jan-17,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Football!,This stadium is clean and has a dun vibe. The fans are fun and really into the game. We purchased our seats on line and they had a great view of the field. The tailgating had a lot of variety to chose from so everyone could find one they liked.
2216,Date of experience: November 2016,9-Nov-16,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Maybe the best gameday experience in the Big12,"Loved my time there, and that's not just cause the 'Horns won.  Great people.  Awesome sightlines.  Free tortillas.  Sat in Sec. 9, at 45 yard line amidst mostly Tech season ticket holders and got complimented by one family as ""the coolest Longhorn fan we've ever had sit near us.""  Made my day, cause I love and respect West Texas people."
2217,Date of experience: September 2016,25-Oct-16,Big 12,Texas tech,5,game,went to the tech game it was so exciding but they got beat but not by much Go Texas Tech !!! The fans in Lubbock are great
2218,Date of experience: October 2016,19-Oct-16,Big 12,Texas tech,4,A Great Place to see a Football Game,Came in to town to see the Texas Tech and Homecoming game.  We purchased our seats in Section 106 Row 40.  When we purchased the seat they looked like they were way up and a long way from the field.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that were good seat and able to see the game without binoculars.
2219,Date of experience: September 2016,24-Sep-16,Big 12,Texas tech,4,Football Season!,"Quick entry even when lines are lengthy. Lots of support staff. Stadium service of some food/drinks if you wish to purchase from your seat. Restroom has been clean and had necessary supplies.  View for the game/band performance is good. The large screen makes it easy to see detail. Environment promotes excitement for the most part.  On the negative side the rows of seats are so close together there isn't leg room for tall persons.  You are forced to get up and down a great number of times while trying to watch the game to allow persons in and out of the rows.  Hand rail entire way up, would lower risk of injury."
2220,Date of experience: September 2016,5-Sep-16,Big 12,Texas tech,5,TTU Football,"Traveled to Lubbock to see the Tx Tech vs S.F.A. game on 9/3/16... Love coming to the Jones, the stadium is always rocking for Football season. The stadium is always clean and pretty easy to find your way around.. Always expect a wild and rowdy crowd, as we always show love for our team... Always a great experience and you'll become a fan for life once you see football inside the Jones."
2221,Date of experience: September 2016,4-Sep-16,Big 12,Texas tech,5,"Fun, Fun, Fun",Went to a Tech game and thoroughly enjoy ourselves. The stadium is a beautiful clean stadium. Very colorful with an astonishing scoreboard. Everybody was welcoming and jovial. Can??t wait to go to another game.
2222,Date of experience: September 2016,4-Sep-16,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Great facility!,"Enjoyed another Red Raider game last night. Clean, well organized, and friendly football facility that would rank among the best in college football. A must for college fans when in Lubbock."
2224,Date of experience: October 2015,10-Aug-16,Big 12,Texas tech,4,Very nice stadium,The stadium is well laid out for easy entrance and exit. The number of people they manage to get in and out after a game is staggering. The facilities were very clean and everything inside like bathrooms and concessions are easy to get to.
2226,Date of experience: September 2015,22-Jul-16,Big 12,Texas tech,4,Texas Tech vs TCU,"Really large stadium (68,000) and packed during Texas Tech home games.  Great security and easy in and out despite huge crowds.  Parking is limited so be prepared to walk some distance to stadium."
2228,Date of experience: October 2015,29-May-16,Big 12,Texas tech,5,GO RAIDERS,"Stadium is always full of RAIDER spirit, incredible lighting, huge television in the stadium and the MASKED RIDER is AWESOME.  Always exciting to watch games with students & fans.  Loud & entertaining."
2231,Date of experience: October 2015,4-May-16,Big 12,Texas tech,4,Good vives,"Great atmosphere, especially for Tech fans. The upgrades made in the last year are great. It's definitely a fun place to watch your favorite team!"
2233,Date of experience: September 2015,11-Feb-16,Big 12,Texas tech,4,"Great Home Field, Not Much for Visitors","I have been privileged to attend games here off and on since 1978 and one thing never changes... This is Red Raider Land and visitors on the field and in the stands are going to feel the wrath of taking up space in The Jones. I have outgrown most of it and find it difficult to be a part of some of the rude harassment that prevails. Throwing tortillas can be a quirky tradition along with shouting down the other team during critical situations but when it reaches out to physical abuse of visiting fans we have gone too far. Someday we will grow up and someday we will not have to deal with self entitled alumni from elsewhere. The fact is that I can not tell you that you will enjoy a game at ATT Jones Stadium unless you are a Red Raider. If you can accept this, I hope that you enjoy the game."
2234,Date of experience: September 2015,7-Feb-16,Big 12,Texas tech,1,"Abusive, mean fans and not just students","I was on crutches and denied any kind of help by stadium personnel - and this was only the beginning. I was directed to a seat away from any other visiting fans (TCU) where I had water, soda, and hot coffee poured on me in addition to being subject to a lot of verbal harassment and abuse. The notable aspect of this experience is that I was not among students, but rather adult Tech fans. I won't be back - ever. A number of my Tech alum friends, especially those who live in Lubbock, don't attend games there anymore for the same reasons. And it's a real shame when you can't go to home games to support your team because the home crowd is a bunch of mean, self-possessed jerks."
2235,Date of experience: October 2015,21-Jan-16,Big 12,Texas tech,4,Nice stadium,The Jones is vastly improved over several years ago.  The box suites are nice but the stadium still isn't as nice as other division one schools. Hopefully they will keep making improvements.
2236,Date of experience: November 2015,24-Dec-15,Big 12,Texas tech,4,Great Stadium to watch a game,The stadium itself is very clean with a bright colored field.  They finished the stadium which included suite seats.  I have had the privilege of sitting in one of those suites.  There is enough room for a minimum of 10 people to maximizing to 20 people but it all depends on what size suite you are in.  The wait staff are all prompt and friendly.  The food the Texas Tech restaurant provided was excellent as well.  It was a good time!
2238,Date of experience: November 2015,18-Nov-15,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Great game,"Visiting my son at TTU we went to the game against Kansas State. Besides an exciting and great game, the stadium has great seating, accommodations and is clean."
2239,Date of experience: November 2015,16-Nov-15,Big 12,Texas tech,4,Great Football Venue,"We had tickets to the final 2015 Texas Tech home game. Our seats were section 117 row 45, middle of the section. The view was great, the attached video is of the home team taking the field.Like most bleacher seating, it can be cramped if your neighbors are ""plus sized"" but we enjoyed the stadium. The food venues are good, hot dogs, pretzels, nachos and the usual fare."
2240,Date of experience: October 2015,7-Nov-15,Big 12,Texas tech,5,"rowdy and loud fans, lively students, fantastic venue for Red Raider Football!","This stadium has been raised to another level since I graduated four decades ago! A great venue to watch a Red Raider football game. Only complaint on east side is seats are far too close together for a tall guy like me. My legs are in the aisle as I cannot get them behind the seat in front of me. What the heck, almost standing up most of the game cheering!"
2241,Date of experience: October 2015,14-Oct-15,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Awesome Stadium!! Loved it!,"Good stadium with good seats.  The concessions are typical and overpriced but they were good for what you got.  The seats are comfortable - at least the ones we sat in.  We had 50 yard line seats - 30th row.  The stadium is really hot however on a sunny day so be sure to wear sunscreen, a hat and clothes that you can layer."
2243,Date of experience: September 2015,28-Sep-15,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Rocking at The Jones,"If you want to get into a football game, you must attend a Tech game at The Jones.  The facilities are excellent.  They just replaced all of the seating on the outside seating.  They scoreboard is two years old and is State of the Art.  Lastly, the crowds are unblelievable."
2244,Date of experience: September 2015,28-Sep-15,Big 12,Texas tech,4,Great Big12 Venue,The bus from the very remote parking lot worked great. The screen in the end-zone is big enough to see well from the opposite end of the field. The food was better than expected. The footlong corndog was very good.
2245,Date of experience: September 2015,27-Sep-15,Big 12,Texas tech,3,OK - Glad we won,"Only had bathrooms on one level.  Seating was decent, you could see the field clearly even from the end zones."
2246,Date of experience: September 2015,9-Sep-15,Big 12,Texas tech,3,Very nice facilities but lines are way too long,"The facilities are first rate but the service is poor. The concession stand lines were over 30 minutes to get water and the water fountain lines were 20 minutes. I never saw a ""roaming"" concession person and it was very hot so we had to leave the game. Two years ago they ran out of water but that was not the case this time, it just took way too long to get any. They had more clothing / TT gear stands than necessary and should have used them as quick purchase water stations instead,It's a really nice stadium but stay away on hot game days as they have yet to figure out how to deal with it adequately."
2247,Date of experience: November 2014,31-Aug-15,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Great venue!,I hold season tickets and love attending at the Jones. It's a great environment and easy to navigate!
2255,Date of experience: October 2014,15-Jun-15,Big 12,Texas tech,4,"Fun atmosphere, nice facilities","Sort of a cathedral built to the football-based religion that is Texas football, this stadium has some top-quality features: a huge big screen, clear sight lines, clean facilities, decent food selection, and crazy fans.  Unless you're in a box, don't expect much escape from the west Texas sun and heat!  Can make for an uncomfortable day depending on the time of year.  Water is expensive too."
2256,Date of experience: October 2014,23-Apr-15,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Guns Up for the Red Raiders,Outstanding new architecture and great student atmosphere.  Wonderful place to see a college football game.  Go Tech!
2258,Date of experience: November 2014,8-Dec-14,Big 12,Texas tech,5,GOOOOO TECH!!,Love going to the stadium and watching the games.  Great atmosphere if you are a Tech fan lol....food and drinks might be pricey so best to do that before the game.
2259,Date of experience: November 2014,24-Nov-14,Big 12,Texas tech,1,"Horrible!  Too Much Piped In ""Music""","There was far too much piped-in recorded music played loudly through the speakers.  Conversations were nearly impossible, the referee's voice was drowned out, and the bands were pretty much sent the message that their presence was not wanted by the stadium staff.  Then there were over-the-top irritations such as ""Kiss-Cam"" and ""Hamster Ball Races"" and the like broadcast on the video board that took away from the entire collegiate game atmosphere.  Advertising was excessive.  In a word, the experience was awful."
2260,Date of experience: November 2014,22-Nov-14,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Beautiful stadium,This is a great stadium and architecturally looks like it was built years ago.  Their large video screen is better than most Big 12 stadiums and great for replays.
2261,Date of experience: November 2014,18-Nov-14,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Texas Tech vs OU,A great college football venue! The atmosphere is great in a very nice stadium. A true college football experience! Go Tech!
2262,Date of experience: October 2014,9-Nov-14,Big 12,Texas tech,5,"Venue was Great, Game ended sadly","Our grandson attends graduate school at Texas Tech. My wife and I and his dad, step-mom and siblings attended the Tech - West Virginia game. We sat on east stands at about 35 yard line WAY up, like row 50. We had a great view. I was pleasantly surprised at how many food and drink stands the stadium had as well as really ample restrooms. It also has great video screens. Its a really nice venue, but unfortunately the WV kicker kicked a career-long 55-yard field goal with 3 seconds left to beat Tech! It was an exciting game, however."
2263,Date of experience: November 2014,5-Nov-14,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Guns Up!,"Ok, so this review is biased because I'm a die-hard Red Raider fan, but they've still done a great job building up the stadium over the past few years.  The renevations are impressive and I can't wait to see the next stages over the upcoming years.  Concession prices are high, but that's typical for any sporting venue.  The food is pretty good (for concessions food)."
2264,Date of experience: October 2014,22-Oct-14,Big 12,Texas tech,4,"Nice stadium design, good sight lines","This is a good sports stadium.  Sight lines (even those at angles) are better than at most venues of this size.  Food service is adequate but not exceptional (and, unless I missed something, situated only on the ground level, so those with higher-level seats have to walk down for service).  Parking is a challenge, but that will always be true for on-campus venues with high attendance."
2265,Date of experience: October 2014,20-Oct-14,Big 12,Texas tech,4,Good place to watch a game,I have been coming to a game here for the last 15 years.  The Stadium has grown but not in a bad way.  First there is not a bad seat in the house.  The crowd is generally very into the game and Tech has had some great offensive teams over the years.  This year they are not as good as in the past but still a great place to watch the game.  Not as big a tailgaiting area as in many college stadiums but still acceptable.
2266,Date of experience: October 2014,19-Oct-14,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Awesome!!,"LOVED the experience overall - fun game - comfortable seating with backs to lean on!  Good variety of food and drink options.  Didn't like that our daughter (a student) couldn't sit with us at the game because she had a student ticket (student seating was on the other side of the stadium from where we sat). Other than that, it was great!"
2267,Date of experience: September 2014,14-Oct-14,Big 12,Texas tech,4,Great place to catch a football game,How can you not come to Lubbock Texas and go see a Texas Tech Red Raiders football game? It's an excellent atmosphere. Guns Up! Wreck 'Em.
2268,Date of experience: October 2014,14-Oct-14,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Great Venue,"We really enjoyed our visit to the game and loved to see all the traditions, school spirit and overall game experience.  I'd love to come back to watch another football game here."
2269,Date of experience: October 2014,14-Oct-14,Big 12,Texas tech,3,Great Stadium - Fans Need to Step It Up.,"Jones AT&T Stadium is a great place to watch a game, but the fans need to step it up a notch and learn how to be a disruptive factor in the game. We attended the TT vs WVU game this past weekend and numerous times WVU had 3rd and short and the crowd was barely audible. Now I'm not an Aggie, but I've been to a few games at Kyle Field and not for a second would the 12th Man let the other team be able to hear a snap count on 3rd down or a field goal. So, as a venue it's a 5, but for fan participation its a 2 so I give it an average of 3."
2270,Date of experience: October 2014,13-Oct-14,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Go Red Raiders!,This is a beautiful college stadium.  Not a bad seat in the house. Concesssions are reasonable and you can rent a cushioned stadium seat for  $8.00/ best 8bucks I ever spent
2271,Date of experience: September 2014,17-Sep-14,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Not a better venue for football,The stadium is getting up there in years but the additions are helping. Not a better place for football on Tech game day! There's no where like it for atmosphere.
2272,Date of experience: September 2014,13-Sep-14,Big 12,Texas tech,4,Texas Tech vs Arkansas,The stadium is first class. The crowd excitement was good. I recommend this as a place to catch a college football game.
2273,Date of experience: August 2014,2-Sep-14,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Texas Tech beats UCA,"We're Texas Tech fans - what else do you need to know?  First time to see the refurbished Jones since I graduated.  Second largest stadium attendance for a season opener - 60,788. The Jones is magnificent!"
2274,Date of experience: October 2013,2-Sep-14,Big 12,Texas tech,5,fun,"College football is fun to watch. Even more fun being there. Love the atmosphere. The fans are the best. The students can be a little too rowdy, but hey....it's a ballgame."
2276,Date of experience: September 2013,23-Aug-14,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Wreck em Tech,Wow talk about a professional polished stadium. This is wonderful. The spirit at the games is overwhelming!
2277,Date of experience: September 2013,19-Aug-14,Big 12,Texas tech,4,I'm an aggie but Jones stadium is getting better and better.,"outside of the usual parking troubles for most college towns on football day, Jones Stadium is becoming a very good place to go see a game. the expansion and the upgrades are well done."
2278,Date of experience: October 2013,6-Aug-14,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Wreck em!,"Great experience at the stadium. There has been a vast amount of money and thought put into the design of this stadium. Raider alley, the stadium the area as a whole creates a fantastic atmosphere for College football! I find it almost unbelievable to have such a great quality venue in such a smaller location. This stadium competes with some of the best NFL stadiums in many aspects!"
2281,Date of experience: September 2013,16-Apr-14,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Great stadium for the fan!,Major improvements to the stadium with many amenities. Makes for a fun game experience! Stadium has had the seating increased for more fan viewing.
2282,Date of experience: November 2013,20-Feb-14,Big 12,Texas tech,1,Worst fans in the nation,"My family and I will not return to this place EVER.  Worst treatment of opposing fans I have ever experienced, and I have visited 10 different college football statdiums.  Passionate fans are one thing, treating the opposing fans AND THEIR CHILDREN like scum is another.  I've seen everyone from 3 years old to 85 years old treated awful here.  Only positive is the stadium renovation is nice."
2283,Date of experience: November 2013,11-Jan-14,Big 12,Texas tech,5,Electric for big games...,just crazy fun for other games.  Concessions offer a wide variety of fare.  Tech fans are passionate but not as Aggie would lead you to believe.  Very fun atmosphere.  Usually full to the brim.
2289,Date of experience: November 2020,22-Nov-20,Big 12,UCF-spectrum stadium,4,Bounce House a great venue,"Beautiful stadium on the UCF campus.   Be ware of the mask police.  The mask policy was enforced haphazardly around the stadium.  It seemed that some people could remove masks while drinking and others were expected to put it on in between each drink.   If Covid risks really frightened you, it seems you wouldn't attend a college football game.  But that's just me.  Bottom line.  Whatever the policy is, it should be enforced equally.   Some training of mask enforcement police might help.Bathrooms were clean.  Fans were nice and the Bearcats came away with a victory.Its called the Bounce House for a reason.  Even at 25% capacity, the place was rockin'."
2290,Date of experience: October 2018,9-Aug-19,Big 12,UCF-spectrum stadium,5,Wonderful experience,"UCF campus is absolutely gorgeous, and the stadium is great.  Looking forward to another UCF football game."
2291,Date of experience: November 2018,10-Nov-18,Big 12,UCF-spectrum stadium,3,slow service for entry and concessions,We attended the UCF vs Navy game. The stadium appeared to be close to capacity. It took 16 minutes from entry of the line to provide tickets and admission to the stadium. We went to the Mexican concession which sold tacos for $10-12. At the beginning of half time. We did not get our food until there was only 6 minutes left in the third quarter. Sodas and water were $4 each. Souvenir cups were $6 each with $3 refills. The rest rooms were very busy but relatively clean. We parked at a church near the stadium for $20    Overall an average experience for a stadium. Plan to hike up stairs.  The primary way into the stadium.
2292,Date of experience: January 2018,16-Jan-18,Big 12,UCF-spectrum stadium,5,One of the nicest university stadiums you will see!,"Caught a 2018 Florida Cup game in this beautiful UCF stadium.  WOW we were blown away.  The gorgeous pitch, the incredible training field and the incredible seating areas."
2293,Date of experience: January 2018,14-Jan-18,Big 12,UCF-spectrum stadium,3,Excellent stadium,"Although I describe it as excellent the location and difficulty parking are two reasons not to give it 5.Also, we had VIP tickets yet were on an open air level directly opposite the main stand where I'd have expected to be seated. Only one lift to take us up to 3rd level. Good stadium to watch a game in but not easy to get to or away from."
2294,Date of experience: December 2017,7-Dec-17,Big 12,UCF-spectrum stadium,3,No restrooms or concessions on the upper level!!!!!,"We were here for the AAC Championship game (UCF vs. Univ. of Memphis) last Saturday.  All visitor's parking is a long way from the stadium.  The UCF website states there is suppose to be a tram that circles the campus to pick up people and drop off closer to the stadium, then a shuttle from there directly to the stadium main entrance. We never saw either one the entire time we were walking.  The visitor's section (224-227) is a two-story climb up stairs and then more stairs to get to your row.  There are no restrooms or concessions on the upper level, which means a long walk down the stairs and then back up."
2295,Date of experience: December 2017,7-Dec-17,Big 12,UCF-spectrum stadium,5,Amazing Facility!!!,"WOW - we have been to several NBA stadiums across the US and this is one of the best, if not the best.  Very well payed out, tons of eating places, ample restrooms, and seating conditions are ideal for watching the game.  A great atmosphere also!!!"
2296,Date of experience: December 2017,3-Dec-17,Big 12,UCF-spectrum stadium,4,Great place to catch a game!,"Went there this past Saturday to watch the Conference Championship game between UCF and Memphis and had a blast.The stadium is quite a long walk away from any parking lots, but once we got there, we loved the atmosphere all around. It also didn't hurt that the game went to double overtime and that the home team won. It's just too bad it is a dry stadium with no alcohol."
2298,Date of experience: October 2022,3-Oct-22,Big 12,Utah,4,Eat before you go,I liked the energy of RES!  I loved the seating and Utah plays good football.  The ease of parking elsewhere and taking a bus or train is great.  The reason I gave this place four stars: the food is awful.  My fries were under cooked and my chicken was over cooked
2299,Date of experience: November 2018,27-Nov-18,Big 12,Utah,5,Great venue,Went for a football game over thanksgiving weekend.  The atmosphere is great.  The fans are fun.  The vendors are good for stadium food.
2300,Date of experience: November 2018,11-Nov-18,Big 12,Utah,4,Nice stadium,2nd time here. 99% of the fans are great. Good atmosphere for college football. Great tailgating and decent weather for November.
2301,Date of experience: October 2018,28-Oct-18,Big 12,Utah,5,Fun football experience,"Went for a college football game.The crowd was into it, the employees were friendly and helpful, it was clean, bleacher seating at top with plenty of leg room. Be sure you don't bring a bag in unless it is clear."
2302,Date of experience: November 2017,20-Nov-17,Big 12,Utah,5,Great Banquet Facility in Varsity Room,"Attended an event over the weekend in the varsity room.  Incredible views of the city, excellent space, and easy parking.  Food service was amazing."
2303,Date of experience: September 2017,11-Oct-17,Big 12,Utah,2,Stadium has flaws but good atmosphere,There are things I really like about coming here but overall not that special of a college football experience.  Fans are really more just recently getting into college football last 10 years so don't expect anything too much
2307,Date of experience: October 2022,30-Oct-22,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Wonderful Experience with Remarkable WVU Fans,"I am a TCU alum that has been coming to Mountaineer Field every other year since 2016 with my daughter to watch TCU play the Mountaineers. The fans are loud and vocal in supporting their WVU and definitely makes it challenging for opposing teams on the field. With that said - The WVU fans have always shown love and respect to me and my daughter attending the games. For the 2022 game - I was given drinks and offered food from WVU fans tailgating while we were sitting in the car at stadium parking.  While walking to the stadium in our purple and well marked ??TCU?? clothing - we received numerous ??welcome to Morgantown?? greetings.  As an Army veteran - I salute for the star spangle banner. In the 2nd quarter of the game - I get a tap on my shoulder from a WVU fan who gives me a beer and says, ??thank you for your service.?? The WVU fans are remarkable people that have provided fantastic experiences for my family attended games here. Due to the kindness shown at Mountaineer Field - I am a big WVU supporter when they are not playing TCU. Great fans and people in Morgantown and West Virginia."
2308,Date of experience: October 2022,27-Oct-22,Big 12,West Virginia,5,A Win of a Day,"Singing ??Country Roads?? at the end of a win at WVU   Beautiful day and enjoyed the Hall of Traditions ,seeing all the trophy??s and historical pictures and uniforms of our beloved ??Mountaineers??"
2309,Date of experience: September 2021,23-Sep-21,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Great experience,Great place to see a football game.  Mountaineers are a proud and rowdy bunch!  Makes for an eventful game.  Plenty of clean restrooms and food venues.  Lots of staff throughout the stadium .  The whole stadium singing Country Roads after the game can't be beat!
2310,Date of experience: November 2019,1-Mar-20,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Football,A great venue to watch The West Virginia Mountaineers play football. One of the rowdiest and loudest  places to take on a game!
2311,Date of experience: October 2019,7-Feb-20,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Best college football atmosphere in all of football,I have been to 3-4 games at this stadium and the fans and atmosphere can not be beat !!!! The band at halftime is very good .
2312,Date of experience: November 2019,4-Dec-19,Big 12,West Virginia,5,"Great game, great atmosphere","So I'll admit that my experience was aided in the fact my Cowboys won, but I did thoroughly enjoy my experience. Nice facilities. Hometown fans were great and courteous. It was definitely worth the trip."
2313,Date of experience: November 2019,25-Nov-19,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Worth a visit,"I came here as a fan of football and to scratch this stadium off my list.  It's a pretty nice stadium, not too small nor large, and all the costs were very reasonable.  We sat in section 103, row 5, very close to the field.  Excellent seats!  WV also has a very nice band to watch."
2314,Date of experience: October 2019,7-Oct-19,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Great view and nice stadium,"My wife and I went there last weekend for a football game vs Texas. The field is atop a hill, so a little walk up ramp, but not bad. The venue is well setup and easy to navigate.  They have nice food and beverage stands around the stadium.  You can buy beer, which is great.  The bathrooms were clean also. Just a fantastic experience at WVU stadium. The people are friendly and  helpful.  I highly recommend trying a game here."
2315,Date of experience: October 2019,6-Oct-19,Big 12,West Virginia,5,2019 Homecoming Game,Attended the 2019 Homecoming Game at Milan Pushkar Stadium. We loved the game and atmosphere. We only wish WV would have beat Texas. Maybe next year!
2316,Date of experience: October 2019,6-Oct-19,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Cool place,Awesome facility. Very clean and great seats from nearly anywhere in the stadium. Easy in and out. Highly recommend.
2317,Date of experience: September 2019,16-Sep-19,Big 12,West Virginia,5,"Let??s Go, Mountaineers!",Mountaineer Field is the place to be on Saturdays in WV! From the tailgate parties pre-game to singing Country Roads after a WVU win it??s none stop stimulation. Don??t forget the Pride of WV Marching band. Makes you proud to be a Mountaineer Fan!
2320,Date of experience: October 2018,13-Feb-19,Big 12,West Virginia,1,Gees Gold,Just a place for weekend Drunks to take up the hospitals parking lot.Employess must find their own parking on game days.Even visiters or limited to where they can park.Put a 60000 person stadium on an old golf course with no parking..Genius!!
2321,Date of experience: October 2018,6-Feb-19,Big 12,West Virginia,5,It??s just good they have food,"Expensive, but the perfect meal for when you??re blacked out drunk. Not only does it semi taste like throw up the first time, but it definitely does the second time. Sodexo Sux. Let??s just leave it at that."
2322,Date of experience: November 2018,4-Jan-19,Big 12,West Virginia,5,WVU vs. OU,We have always wanted to attend a game at Mountaineer field. This was the first year we were able to do that since it was during Thanksgiving weekend. The stadium is nice and a little small. We had seats in the visitors section all the way at the top. We were abl;e to see the netire field and we were very pleased with most of the WVU fans. It was definitely a great experience
2323,Date of experience: September 2018,12-Dec-18,Big 12,West Virginia,1,Not what you think.....,"The band plays the exact same thing, the intro for the team is the same, overpriced food and beverage. Not worth a ticket price as the fans are extremely unruly... just a horrible experience."
2324,Date of experience: December 2018,11-Dec-18,Big 12,West Virginia,3,If you like to drink then this is great. Not for children,Too many drunks in and outside of the game. If you like to drink and deal with drunks then you??ll love this place but if you??re looking for a family environment then this is not the place for you. It was better when they didn??t allowing drinking in the stadium. The food is horrible and WAY overpriced.
2325,Date of experience: October 2018,3-Dec-18,Big 12,West Virginia,4,WVU football,"I love WVU football games and the atmosphere but i liked it much better when they didn??t serve alcohol at the games. You really need to be careful where you sit because if you get stuck in the middle of a bunch of drunks with small children then it can make for an unpleasant time. Otherwise, I love Mountaineer field and I love the fact that they have large bathroom facilities accessible in most areas. The food is way overpriced so I don??t recommend eating there. The Papa Johns pizza was old and disgusting. If you go, definitely purchase family package deals online because you save a little money. Parking is also a nightmare if you don??t know anyone who lives near the area. Be prepared to pay 20$ or so to park in a decent spot."
2326,Date of experience: November 2018,25-Nov-18,Big 12,West Virginia,4,"If your team is playing West Virginia on the road, this is a very nice place to see the game.","Nice Stadium, good food choices.  Restrooms where big and clean.  Signage was easy to read. Finding seats was a breeze and the field, lighting, and audio all added to the experience.  I would definitely go back."
2327,Date of experience: October 2018,27-Oct-18,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Iconic place for College Football,"One of the best atmospheres to watch a college football game.60,000 fans staying to sing Country Roads after a home win is a special experience"
2328,Date of experience: October 2018,26-Oct-18,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Cozy stadium,Visiting from out of town to see other college football venues.  There is limited parking around the stadium - unless you park at the adjacent hospital.  Stadium has good sight lines and is well laid out.  Wasn't able to attend a game to assess the game day atmosphere - but it's nestled into the hills and doesn't dominate the landscape.
2329,Date of experience: November 2017,2-Oct-18,Big 12,West Virginia,5,25 year Season Ticket Holder,"The stadium is Electric with the students and alumni cheering on the Mountaineers. Our Mountaineer is ??The Only?? college Mascot who can talk and act as a human - because he is! Some stadiums might be bigger, fancier or classy, but Mountaineer Field represents an entire State and it shows."
2330,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Oct-18,Big 12,West Virginia,2,Never Again,"The rave reviews you're reading are from WVU ""homers"" who would never give a negative opinion on their beloved institution's football stadium, even if it were true. Foul-mouthed, drunken students cause you to quickly remember how nice it is to watch the game at home. The food selections are awful. The one bright spot is that the restrooms are unusually clean and neat. I was very surprised about that."
2331,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Oct-18,Big 12,West Virginia,3,Students Ruin It Again,"Recently, I went with a small group to the K-State vs WVU game. Our seats were great. However, once again the WVU students ruined the experience. Nothing new here. A student threw a football from the upper deck, and it struck a lady in the back of the head just a couple of rows in front of me. This lady was holding a 1 year old baby in her lap. Parking...OMG is this the worst location ever for a college football stadium. If you've been here before, you know. The food selection at the stadium just plain sucks. You already know you're going to pay ridiculous amounts for awful food, but you're better off eating out once you leave. Stay home and watch the game from your favorite chair."
2332,Date of experience: August 2018,14-Aug-18,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Great Stadium.,En route from DC to Nashville??-decided to stop here. Glad I did. WV has a great stadium. I??m an SEC alum (LSU) so fairly biased??-but this place was really cool to see. Easy on and of from Interstate Awesome weather in early August.
2334,Date of experience: October 2017,28-Jun-18,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Best College Football Atmosphere in WV,"Mountaineer Field is alive on Game Days!! You can feel the electric pulse course through the veins of the Mountaineer faithful. There is not another place like it for college football in WV. Its Loud, Rowdy, and Intense!!!"
2336,Date of experience: September 2017,26-May-18,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Football Games,Love going to this stadium with the only downfall being you are very exposed to the weather if not sitting under the overhangs.
2337,Date of experience: September 2017,26-Apr-18,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Fantastic College Stadium,"Let's Go Mountaineers! This is a great stadium that sells beer during the games! We've been a few times and have always had a great experience. The stadium is easily accessible,the tailgate parties are the best I've ever been to. The stadium is clean, the seating is excellent and the crowd is fun!"
2338,Date of experience: October 2017,10-Apr-18,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Great stadium and great fans,Awesome and lots fun. Clean. Safe. Good munchies and drinks. Clean restrooms. Exciting and high energy levels. wVU won and when 65k people sang Country Roads my group all had eyes full of tears as we had our arms around each other with tearful joy.
2339,Date of experience: September 2017,22-Jan-18,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Loved it,"Just wish it was an enclosed stadium lol not much of a wblvu fan but I was impressed, def will go back"
2340,Date of experience: January 2018,22-Jan-18,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Big 12 Football at its best,Great place to the Mountaineers take on their Big 12 opponents. Recently refurbished and handicapped accessible. Decent sports venue foods and beers.
2341,Date of experience: November 2017,21-Nov-17,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Lots of Fun,"Lots of fun. Just wish WVU would have won the game but still had a great time. Will be back again. No bad seats at all,"
2342,Date of experience: November 2017,11-Nov-17,Big 12,West Virginia,5,It was a Great Day to be a Mountaineer!,"My family and I attended the WVU vs Iowa State University game on Saturday, November 4th, 2017. There have been numerous and very expensive upgrades to the stadium over the last few years. Upgraded consessions and restrooms, new lighting as well as an easy to see videoboard. This thing is huge. There are additional areas to enter and almost no waiting. This place is just beautiful . Nothing matches walking out from under the stadium and through the entrance into where you can 1st view the field. It's special to say the least. We have been coming since my children were very small and I have been coming since the early Don Nelen days. We arrived in town a couple of hours early to enjoy some tailgating before the game. We found very inexpensive parking ($10) that was near the stadium. It wasn't a very far walk at all. WVU came in unranked against a #15 ISU team. Of course Lee Corso always picks anyone but WVU and went with ISU. Go figure. We always try to get into the stadium early enough to see the team workout. We also love to watch the greatest college band in the Nation, ""The Pride of WV"", do their pregame show and hear ""Simple Gifts"" as well as our other gameday standards. Their WVU formations are always a thing of beauty. A C-17 did a fly over during the ""National Anthem"" that was great to watch. Then we enjoyed the hype of watching the band, cheerleaders, and fans line up to welcome the Mountaineers onto the playing field! It's an electric atmosphere. Everyone gets worked up showing the team how much we enjoy them and want them to win. Hearing the ""Let's Go"" from one side of the stadium and then ""Mountaineers!"" from the other side, was so loud and rousing. The fans were pumped up and energetic. They were in the game from beginning to end. It great when they are pumped up for the duration of the game for the team. Fans yelled as loud on 1st down, making noise against Iowa's offense, as they did on 3rd down. I put in an earbid to listen to Toney Caridi and team call the game. Then the Mountaineers worked their magic. The 'Eers were way ahead at halftime. The Pride of WV came out again with their ""Armed Forces Medley"". It was military appreciation day and ""The Pride"" were awesome as always. Their military formations were spectacular to see. There was a special presentation honoring a 104 year old Pearl Harbor Survivor from WWII. Navy Lieutenant, Jim Downing who was on the USS West Virginia during the attack was recognized. Everyone stood to their feet, applauded him for his brave service to our country, and yelled, ""USA,USA,USA!"" It was quite moving. Then it was back to the game. The game tightened up and came down to the last couple of minutes to seal the deal, but the Mountaineers beat a ranked team at home. We were here in 2014 when WVU spanked a 4th ranked Baylor, 41-27, upseting them while shocking the sports world. The same happened on this day. Of course we stayed to sing along with John Denver's ""Country Roads"". Not many people left before the song. To many fans surprise the Iowa State Fans did too. All of the fans were well behaved and friendly. The drive out of our parking lot and out of Morgantown was easy as well. Everyone exercised their patience. As always, ""It's a Great Day to be a Mountaineer, wherever you may be!"""

2345,Date of experience: November 2017,7-Nov-17,Big 12,West Virginia,5,WVU versus ISU,We went to the Mountaineers versus the Cyclones football game.  The game was thrilling and very enjoyable. Mountaineer field is easy to access and enter the stadium. Our tickets were digital and it only took a moment to access the stadium.  We paid $147 for two tickets.  And another $20 to park in the purple lot. The $20 is worth the price if you enjoy tailgating. The tailgating in Morgantown is really a neat experience.
2346,Date of experience: October 2017,5-Nov-17,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Love the ??eers,"Great field. Good location. No bad seats anywhere. Food is overpriced and bad, as most stadium food is."
2347,Date of experience: October 2017,1-Nov-17,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Oklahoma State game,"The stadium was easy to get to. They rent seat backs which were worth it, even though we stood for most of the game. We sat in section 122 and had a very good view of the field. Bathrooms were clean and very little waiting time for men and women. Food and drink venues were easy to find and get to. Enjoyed the experience."
2348,Date of experience: October 2017,24-Oct-17,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Loved the Game!!!,Was very excited to experience WVU Football with my family. The stadium is the perfect place to see old friends and watch some kick butt WVU Footbal!!!!
2349,Date of experience: September 2017,18-Oct-17,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Brautiful but get inside to see museum,"I went there on vacation and wanted to go inside to see the WVU museum but the front door has a punch pad for admittance. So I left sad and wondered why they did this? In the past you could get inside with no problem.    Other than that don't miss a game at the stadium if you can, you won't be disappointed!"
2350,Date of experience: September 2017,20-Sep-17,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Great experience for all!! Must do,"This place is amazing. Best fans, and best food you can ask for. This is a must do either by yourself or with your family."
2351,Date of experience: September 2017,17-Sep-17,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Fun game!,"WVU games are so much fun to attend. The school spirit is energizing. The stadiums itself was clean and easy to find your way around in. Even with a lot of fans, it was not too difficult to get in and out of."
2352,Date of experience: September 2017,13-Sep-17,Big 12,West Virginia,5,WVU vs ECU,Great football game.   Tailgate at Mylan Pharma was awesome.   Seats on 15 yardline in upper level gave very good view of game.   Parking lot tailgates.   Fun had by all.
2353,Date of experience: September 2017,11-Sep-17,Big 12,West Virginia,5,"Beautiful Stadium , Great Fans !

If you are looking for a great college town with a great football stadium and great team , PLEASE Take in a game at Mountaineer Field! Great Tailgates !! Have Fun I know you will"
2354,Date of experience: September 2017,10-Sep-17,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Great Football Stadium,"We visited the stadium for a football game. Our first time & loved it (other than our team lost). Super friendly vendors & fans. Restrooms very clean. It was fun to watch a football game with the mountains in the background, absolutely beautiful!!"
2355,Date of experience: September 2017,5-Sep-17,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Beautiful,I got to view it from the outside. It is a magnificent building. I am so happy I got to see this. Whomever bought this did a great job.
2356,Date of experience: September 2016,16-Aug-17,Big 12,West Virginia,3,Gotta be a tuff WVU fan.....,"Gotta be a diehard fan to enjoy this place.  VERY limited parking, high price tickets, outrageously priced stadium food and beverages. Love the Mounties, but this place is an open stadium, so either too hot or too cold. The main West Virginia hospital is just yards away.    Strange setup"
2357,Date of experience: August 2017,11-Aug-17,Big 12,West Virginia,5,It's a great day,To be a mountaineer. Best in the big 12. The improvements to the concourse and the gates are a big plus
2358,Date of experience: October 2016,21-Jul-17,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Best place for college football,The Gameday atmosphere is better than anywhere else. I love to tailgate at WVU and cannot wait to see all the new stadium upgrades underway.

2360,Date of experience: October 2016,7-Jul-17,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Let's Go Mountaineers,Wow  I been to many NFL games and stadiums but spending day at WVU game and singing Country roads after victory put a tear and smile on our faces
2364,Date of experience: November 2016,22-Feb-17,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Beautiful field and lots of fun,"I came here with friends for a tailgate party prior to a game and then we attended the game.  It was a great day and lots going on.  The band did a better show prior to the game beginning, in my opinion, so make sure you go early to enjoy it.  They are great!  The only bad thing I would have to say is parking, so ensure you know where you plan to park prior to the game and then be prepared to walk."
2365,Date of experience: September 2016,27-Jan-17,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Go Mountaineers!!!,Not a bad seat in the house!!  Concessions are reasonably priced!!  Restrooms and clean and plentiful!!
2366,Date of experience: December 2016,7-Dec-16,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Only place to be on a fall Saturday,Without sports you won't find much to do in town so if there is a game this is the place to be. They have tried to improve the facilities of late but really we are just here to watch a game and hopefully a win.
2367,Date of experience: December 2016,7-Dec-16,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Season ticket holder,We enjoy our Saturday's at Mountaineer field! It's always a great time with family and friends! The atmosphere has changed dramatically in the last few years for the better! The only complaint that we have now is that the ushers no longer check tickets and we end up with a lot of people in our section that shouldn't be.
2368,Date of experience: October 2016,29-Nov-16,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Great to see WVU Win,Went here to watch them beat TCU.  The stadium was packed and the atmosphere was great.  Look forward to going back for another.
2369,Date of experience: November 2016,27-Nov-16,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Gameday!!,"I visited the stadium once again during a friend's visit for watching the Mountaineers play against the Oklahoma Sooners. Even though it snowed, the atmosphere was great, the stadium full and we had a good time!"
2370,Date of experience: November 2016,27-Nov-16,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Great time -- OU vs WVU Football,We drove to Morgantown from DC for the OU vs WVU game.  What a great experience.  The Mountaineer fans were very friendly.  We parked and tailgated in the Green Lot which was a 10-15 walk to the stadium.  Look forward to returning to Morgantown in the future.
2371,Date of experience: October 2016,9-Nov-16,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Mountaineer football,"Great college atmosphere to watch a game. Come early to see the pregame festivities and to partake in tailgating. Stay and sing ""Country Roads"" at games end. Great atmosphere."
2372,Date of experience: November 2016,7-Nov-16,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Fun game,"Had a great time here watching the Mountaineers win. Clean updated stadium , friendly employees. Did not get any food as we tailgates ahead of time. Took the bus from the coliseum."
2373,Date of experience: November 2016,6-Nov-16,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Always fun,"As Mountaineer fans, we're here often.  The tailgating scene is awesome for adults and children and you can't beat the game atmosphere.   Yes, there's a good deal of drinking by some tailgaters, but it's pretty easy to avoid (or join in) if that lady your preference.  They also made recent renovations to the stadium itself and although things were a bit bumpy at first (resulting in long lines), things appear to be much better now."
2374,Date of experience: October 2016,2-Nov-16,Big 12,West Virginia,5,WVU Go mountaineers,Really nice WVU stadium; enjoyed the Kansas game Will full house WVU stadium. The tail gate area and after the game party is amazing times.
2375,Date of experience: October 2016,30-Oct-16,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Let's Go!!!,We've been going to games for over 30+ years and I love the changes they have made. There is nothing like the rowdy crowd of Mountaineer fans giving the opposing teams he business. There really isn't a bad seat in the stadium.
2376,Date of experience: October 2016,26-Oct-16,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Interesting,"Was amazed about the highy coordinated pregame show. The marching band, color guard, mascot, cheer leaders, music, fireworks and audio entertainment were all very amusing and professional."
2377,Date of experience: October 2016,25-Oct-16,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Football game - we were the opposing team,We had so much fun and the West Virginia fans were great and we've traveled to ALL of the Big XII stadiums. We were invited to eat at more tailgate parties than you can imagine!  The fans checked on us during the game and stopped us after the game to thank us for making the trip. Since our tickets were for the visitors section we were advised to enter the stadium on the press box side because they said their own students might not be as nice to us ... hey they are college students and it always takes a few right? We had a great time and Morgantown and UVW should be commended for their hospitality. Thanks!
2378,Date of experience: October 2016,25-Oct-16,Big 12,West Virginia,4,"Great stadium, great team, LOUSY Concessions","On a cold, windy day probably only half of the 60,000 attendees wanted a hot cup of coffee. Very few if any could buy one. East side, main seating level.  Food lines 20 minutes long BEFORE halftime. No menu board at any of them shows coffee. ""Hot beverage $3.50"" is as close as it gets. There are no coffee/hot chocolate kiosks. Wade thru 1 line for 20 minutes only to find ""we don't have coffee."" Smarter 2nd try asked the girl at the counter before going thru the line who said ""Yes, we have coffee."" Waded thru another 20 minute wait in her line. Get to the front. Ask for ""coffee please, one cream, one splenda."" She says we don't have anything to put in the coffee. ""OK, I'll just have black then won't I.""  Strange interval goes by, she takes my $3.50 and a few minutes later says ""We don't have any coffee.""   It even took a minute or two more to get the refund. Meanwhile 25 to 30 people behind me are wondering what in H is going on. The concession provisions in this otherwise great stadium are a disgrace to the University and a huge disservice to the fans. Worse than absurd.  One Alumni opinion."
2379,Date of experience: October 2016,23-Oct-16,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Improved Facilities at Mountaineer Field,"There have been many improvements since last season.  There were several televisions and food stations, improved restroom facilities, and new entry gates.  This added to the great experience we had on game day."
2380,Date of experience: October 2016,23-Oct-16,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Football Game,What a great place to see a football game.  They even sell Beer.  The atmosphere we endured prior to the game was wonderful.  Free tailgate food and drinks
2381,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Oct-16,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Hail West Virginia!,It's Mountaineer Field - the home of the West Virginia University Mountaineers!  Great stadium and unparalleled environment!
2382,Date of experience: October 2016,9-Oct-16,Big 12,West Virginia,5,New concourse,"SO the first game of the season was a little dicey.  Now they have their act together, the new concourses are nice.  The new entrance is beautiful"
2383,Date of experience: October 2016,2-Oct-16,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Great energy and tradition,"We went to see the K-State/WVU game  - which was a very good game, very close and exciting. The crowd was enthusiastic but very friendly to the 'opposition' fans. Sight lines were good, pretty easy to find your way around. Much easier to get in an out than we thought it would be."
2384,Date of experience: October 2016,2-Oct-16,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Fun place to watch a game,"we just went to the WVU game against K state. The tailgating in the parking lot was amazing. One of the best i have ever attended. The stadium has bleacher seating in a lot of the areas.  The concession are very reasonably priced. Overall, a great experience."
2385,Date of experience: October 2016,2-Oct-16,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Great game,"Had a wonderful time yesterday watching WVU come from behind and beat Kansas State.  We came to watch our son who is a junior cheerleader and enjoyed every facet of the game.Getting into the stadium was very easy.  According to our son, WVU has added more entrances to make it easy to get in.  The stadium was clean and the beer was cold.  After the first quarter, we held up cards and spelled out Mountaineers but the student section was a little lame in this card stunt.  Overall, it was a wonderful afternoon spent at the football field."
2386,Date of experience: September 2016,23-Sep-16,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Great College Atmosphere,"The WVU fans really know how to tailgate and enjoy the game. I was there to watch my alma mater play against WVU and I was really treated great by the WVU fans. The seating in the stadium offers a nice view of the field and all of the action. Like WV though, it sits on top of a hill so be prepared to climb! They need to improve their concession service - long slow moving lines!"
2387,Date of experience: September 2016,18-Sep-16,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Tailgaters Delight,WVU football provides a unique atmosphere for enjoying football or other sports-related events.  The fans and open layout really make for an enjoyable time.
2388,Date of experience: September 2016,18-Sep-16,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Mountaineer Field,"Just to be clear to all visitors including ESPN, Fox Sports, etc.  this is Mountaineer Field - that includes the stadium and the playing field!  Paid for by the taxpayers of the great state of West Virginia!  I was a student here and during my time as a student we moved from Old Mountaineer Field (no longer there - a space now occupied by part of the College of Business on the downtown campus) to this facility on the Evansdale Campus.  This is wonderful stadium that has great views of great football.  Some have applied the name of one individual to this stadium - in direct insult to everyone in the state of West Virginia.  This was, is, and always will be Mountaineer Field at West By God Virginia University - PERIOD.  Montani Semper Liberi!"
2389,Date of experience: September 2016,13-Sep-16,Big 12,West Virginia,4,M-P Ever Expanding,The stadium has expanded concession stands and new turf this year to reflect the growing need to serve fans as the program and university continue to grow.
2390,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Great place for a football game,The stadium was just upgraded this year and it is great.  WVU is a great football town and the fans are great.
2391,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Great game day experience,"have attended several games over the past few years.  Every visit has been enjoyable.  The stadium is a great place to experience college football. Fan seating is fIrly close to field, unlike many stadiums.  Food & beverage opportunities are plenty as are restrooms.  Concession prices are comparable to most athletic venues.  Access & parking for stadium is well organized. We always opt to park at WVU Coliseum (basketball venue) and ride the shuttle buses, which run back-and-forth between venues. Price for shuttle us $4.00 round trip."
2392,Date of experience: September 2016,11-Sep-16,Big 12,West Virginia,5,WVU vs YSU,Great experience. Everyone went out of there way to be nice to us as out of town guests. Would go back again.
2393,Date of experience: October 2015,7-Sep-16,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Best Atmosphere in the Big 12!,"If you show up to Mountaineer field as a WVU football fan, you're going to be treated to one of the best experiences that college football has to offer.  From the pageantry of the over 100-member Mountaineer marching band to the musket-toting, coonskin-cap wearing Mountaineer mascot, Mountaineer Field is as unique as the the beautiful state it represents. Parking abounds within easy walking distance of the stadium. You can take the PRT, but it is very crowded and has long delays post-game. As an enemy fan, you can expect to be heckled."
2395,Date of experience: September 2016,5-Sep-16,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Go Mountaineers,"We always have a blast when attending WVU games. We have season tickets, Section 108, row 24, and we have an awesome view of the field.mit feels like we are right there with the team. The stadium was recently updated, and even though the stadium was filled with fans, we never had to wait in a bathroom line. It was clean and the new gates really streamlined the in and out process. We have tailgated all over the US following our favorite teams, and WVU has to be the very best, followed closely by LSU. Nobody does it better. The fans are excited to support their team and it shows. From the corn hole games in the parking lot to a stadium full of fans singing Country Roads After a win, you will not find a better fan base."
2396,Date of experience: September 2016,4-Sep-16,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Very Cool!,Excellent time with friends at a WVU football game.  Very nice stadium with several food and drink options.  Excellent game day atmosphere.  Very impressed.
2397,Date of experience: September 2016,4-Sep-16,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Awesome Stadium..,"This is a great stadium to watch Mountaineer Games. The one thing that has changed is that the way you enter the games. In the past everyone can go in whatever gate entrance that you wanted to. Now students must enter the student section on the side only, and the non-students must enter the back gate, or front gate. It created mass confusion yesterday.Other than that it's great for games. One new thing they had was a plastic cup with a hole on the bottom with a magnet on top of it covering the hole. They placed the beer on this machine like substance and it filled up. Very cool technology. First time I seen it. Almost looked like something from Shark Tank."
2398,Date of experience: November 2015,22-Aug-16,Big 12,West Virginia,5,great place to watch a Big 12  Football Game,"Not a bad seat in the house! The stadium is loud, There are places to get shelter when it is cold and rainy. Club seats are great! Prices are reasonable as far as stadiums go. The tailgating is top notch! WV is beautiful! The traffic sucks! The fans are dedicated. Come by and see us! Love the Band!"
2399,Date of experience: September 2015,7-Aug-16,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Mountaineers can be proud.,"We were fortunate enough to attend the first game at Mountaineer Field.  My father-in-law helped build the stadium and got tickets.  He gave them to his daughter and me and we went to see the Mountaineers.  John Denver was there to sing ""Almost Heaven, West Virginia"".  Parking can be problematic, but if you go for the day, walk to the stadium, or park and take a shuttle, you can tailgate or visit with those tailgaters in the blue lot.  Food prices are not a bargain, but the stadium experience is great."
2400,Date of experience: September 2015,17-Jul-16,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Always a great time!!,"This stadium is absolutely beautiful! Of course, I am a little biased I did go to school at WVU for six years and I spent most of my Saturday's in this stadium. As an adult, I can appreciate the beauty of this place much more than I did back in my college days! If you are coming in for a football game please note that all of the parking around the stadium is RESERVED, you must have a parking pass to park in these lots and the passes are not cheap! Take my advice, park at the coliseum and take the shuttle they offer! The ride costs about 4 dollars round-trip. There is a greeter on each bus that gives you a little Morgantown history along with some Mountaineer Pride along the way. If you are from a visiting team, please do not be scared! I have never witnessed a Mountaineer fan be anything less than friendly on these buses! In fact, I would recommend all visitors taking this shuttle, it's a lot better than walking through Morgantown with all of the hammered drunk college kids just waiting for the chance to harass you a little (don't worry they won't bite). The stadium itself offers a wide variety of food stands, pizza, popcorn, your typical stadium food. The beer will cost you around 9 dollars a can. The seats are small so take another piece of advice from a seasoned vet, rent the seat cushions or bring your own! That way when the fans get rowdy and start to push over to the right or left, you have your seat! I was on the end of a row once and completely lost my seat by the end of the game. I will not make that mistake again. For families traveling with young kids, bring them earplugs! You may laugh at this suggestion but trust me it can get as loud or louder than a NASCAR race!!!! MAKE SURE YOU GET THERE EARLY SO YOU DO NOT MISS THE PREGAME SHOW!!!!!!!!!!"
2401,Date of experience: November 2015,5-Jun-16,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Game day....,"I can't believe the review of the person who said seating was 8in....he/she must not attend much...bleacher seating is bleacher seating...you get about 14in.Being an alumni and an alumni of ""The Pride"", I will say, with NO Partiality, this is about one of the best college stadiums. With the first row about 15ft off the ground and the end zone seats even higher, there is no bad seat at the facility.Food is pretty good and priced like any other stadium. You can bring in drinks in plastic bottles which have not been opened.There are NO UMBRELLAS allowed so rain gear is a must. Seats on the student-side are sunny...sunglasses and sunscreen are must!There is no parking for those who do not donate significantly to the University or purchase a pass on EBay. You have to pay to park in local lots and homeowner's yards.Traffic before and after is typical for a 60K venue located in a downtown area.Bottom line is it's an electric place on Game Day, and thus, it is well worth any of the issues surrounding it."
2403,Date of experience: October 2015,27-May-16,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Not a Bad Seat,"Since age six I've been going to WVU games.  I can say I've sat in the student section, in the boxes, and in the cheap seats.  I haven't had a bad seat.  Parking is good but on Game Day, forget about it.  I suggest parking at the coliseum and getting a shuttle,  If you get a chance to go to a game or an event here, then go."
2405,Date of experience: November 2015,29-Apr-16,Big 12,West Virginia,1,Mountaineer Field,"First - Parking is terrible. After you pay $25 plus to park, you have to walk a mile to the field. The tailgaters take up the entire Ruby Memorial Hospital lot. So if you need to visit someone in the hospital there is no parking available.Second - The seating is for people with a bottom about 8 inches wide.  I need two! I am not a child.  You have to sit with your shoulders turned sideways.  I had just had back surgery. I was afraid of being knocked down in the crowd.  Plus sitting with my shoulders turned sideways made me ache all over.  Someone behind me spilled beer down the back of my wool coat & I had to have it cleaned. It was a miserable experience.  I will not go back, ever.Third - The food was ridiculously expensive.  Hotdogs were $5."
2406,Date of experience: November 2015,8-Mar-16,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Great Views,"This field was built with great views in mind. From all 4 corners the views are clear and at the right angle for maximum enjoyment. Be warned, it gets real loud. GO MOUNTAINEERS!"
2408,Date of experience: November 2015,24-Feb-16,Big 12,West Virginia,4,WVU vs. Texas,The new renovations will be welcome. Entrance to the stadium was not great but you can see an effort is being made to make things better. And it's always good to see the Mounties beat the Longhorns!
2409,Date of experience: November 2015,19-Feb-16,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Best Crowd Engagement EVER!,"WVU Games have always been a staple for my family. We always had a big crowd with us and everyone really enjoyed getting in the game. We love going, but definitely bring a blanket. It gets cold up in those mountains, especially with the random snow showers. Sit up high in the stands, you don't want the chance of students spilling beer on you i the cold. We always sat up high and always had a perfect view."
2410,Date of experience: November 2015,16-Jan-16,Big 12,West Virginia,4,WVU football,The only time I have been here is for football games but have been going for over 8 years. Its a smaller stadium from any otehr in the big 12 by far. But there is a great atmosphere here. The food selection varies widely and you may have to go to the end zone for specialty places that can change season to season for food. Jersey subs is near the 129 section. There are tents set up near the end zone of specialty foods. Staff is friendly and bathrooms seem to be a lot cleaner than would be expected.
2411,Date of experience: August 2015,16-Dec-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Season ticket holder for 30 years,"Needs updated, overpriced refreshments with long waiting lines, poorly managed restrooms. Women's restrooms seem to be holding areas for drunk women, vs restrooms, with NO supervisors to oversee entrance, exit. It's Big 12, arrest drunks hanging out in the restrooms."
2412,Date of experience: September 2015,15-Dec-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Press Box,"I got a press box visit.  Went down to field and took pictures then watched the game from the press box.  It was excellent, good view, good food.  Also attended the press conferences after the game."
2413,Date of experience: November 2015,12-Dec-15,Big 12,West Virginia,3,Upgrade definitely needed,"Very inconvenient stadium from a fans perspective. It's a major project to go to the bathroom or to get food/refreshments with very long lines. Many of the food options are also unappealing to me. Parking is a very serious problem as well especially with the construction at the hospital, it was bad prior to the construction. The fans in our area are also very disrespectful resulting in difficulting watching the game. It's no wonder why attendance is decreasing. It's much better staying at home or going to a party or bar."
2414,Date of experience: November 2015,10-Dec-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,FUN DAY with GREAT FANS!,"We came for the game on November 14th and went out bright and early to tailgate because it was a noon game. This is the first time there - the family came to visit a relative who is in school there.  Parked at the Collisium which was great. The shuttles were plentiful and VERY well run, so even leaving it moved pretty fast.  The stadium is nice and the fans were friendly and alot of fun to be with!  Since we went so early (about 8:30) to park, we probably could have parked right outside the stadium between the hospital and stadium. That looked like alot of fun.  Next time we will try that. Of course, the day was even better since it was a win for WVU! Be prepared to sing Country Road...."
2415,Date of experience: November 2015,17-Nov-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Let's Go......!!,"It's Mountaineer field, it's always great. And when WVU wins it is always a great time. Went to the Texas game and my friends and I had a great time. Concessions were a little over priced but that is expected. My pepperoni roll was very good. Go Eers!!!"
2416,Date of experience: November 2015,15-Nov-15,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Amazing!!,Awesome experience! Hadn't been to a game in years...what a memory! The stadium was clean and the enthusiasm was contagious!
2417,Date of experience: September 2015,11-Nov-15,Big 12,West Virginia,3,football games and band spectacular,Parking is a special challenge when attending football games or special events.  The stadium shares a parking lot with a community hospital (which presents a whole different set of challenges on game days for those visiting the hospital) but parking is by permit only.  Special event attendees are not permitted to park in the hospital lots and there is no space that has easy access to the stadium.  I attended a local band spectacular and spent almost an hour trying to find a place to park.
2418,Date of experience: October 2015,31-Oct-15,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Can Be A Wonderful Experience,"If you are a Mountaineer fan and you get lucky, there's no better place to spend a sunny Saturday afternoon in the fall, whether the team wins or not. I've been doing so since Don Nehlen's earliest years. If you're not lucky, you'll have drunks falling over you or favoring you with their expletive-filled opinions, because this is now one of a handful of college stadiums that serves beer and some fans can't seem to get enough (or know when to quit). Beer sales are limited to two beers (at a time!). Apparently this is part of the university's fitness regimen as some fans near my section make four or five trips up the aisle in a single game."
2419,Date of experience: November 2014,27-Oct-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Game Day,The WV fans know how to have fun and tailgate. If you have 3 seats together and 1 on the other side of the field they will help you out. I still remember this experience even though it was over 18 yrs ago.
2420,Date of experience: October 2015,26-Oct-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Awesome experience,"I attended a game here during the 2015. I sat in the student section with my cousin, and the atmosphere was electric. They are definitely loud for a stadium that size. The facilities could use updating, but that's my only gripe. The stadium is in a great location, the food was surprising pretty good, and the game itself was a blast."
2421,Date of experience: October 2015,21-Oct-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,No other place like it !!!  WVU football is the best !!,"Great experience !! No bad seats in this stadium , great food , great football , great people, just a awesome place to watch some wvu football !!"
2422,Date of experience: October 2015,14-Oct-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Mountaineers Have Spirit,"This is a wonderful stadium. Not too large that you can't see the action. I am a little biased as I am an alumni.The crowd is always high spirited with both sides of the stadium challenging the other with ""Let's go"" on one side and ""Mountaineers"" from the other.Love to go to the Alma Mater for a game.None of the seats have backs so pick up a rental seat back with cushion after you get in stadium."
2423,Date of experience: October 2015,12-Oct-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,WVU Football,"As far as university football stadiums go - there isn't a bad seat int he house!!  I have attended many a WVU football game there and at the old football stadium (that no longer exists) and the experience is Fantastic!! Supporting WVU and going to the games is an adventure in itself and everyone should experience it anytime they get a chance to come to Morgantown and attend a game.  Whether we win or lose 0 I'm a diehard Mountaineer fan!!  The games are electric and very exciting and the band coming out onto the field and playing Simple Gifts can't be beat - it gets me every time, and don't forget about singing Country Roads at the end of each game - that's priceless!!"
2424,Date of experience: September 2015,4-Oct-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Mountainer Field........Almost Heaven!,"Mountaineer Field is a place where all WVU Football fans gather several times a year to visit, retell old tales of yore, eat, drink and simply enjoy the Mountaineer Game Day Experience! It is not unusual for starangers to offer you free food and drink. I met with a former classmate I hadn't seen since June 5, 1974!"
2425,Date of experience: September 2015,4-Oct-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Favorite place in Morgantown.,"Take me home Country Roads!  I have spent many Saturday afternoons at Mountaineer Field.  Before game tailgating in the Blue Lot.  They are renovating this old lady widening concourses, improving restroom facilities, and upgrading food quality and choice.  Didn't miss a home game from 1988 through 2013.  Some of my most memorable moments have been at Mountaineer Field.  The best one was watching my son run onto the field through the blue helmet with the smoke rising and crowd going crazy.  Recently visited friends and took in the game versus Maryland."
2426,Date of experience: September 2015,1-Oct-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Great Sporting Experience,Awesome! Fans were great and a wonderful experience to remember! People were friendly and easy to talk with. Just amazing! Can't wait to go back.
2427,Date of experience: September 2015,1-Oct-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Mountianeer Fan  Lets Go Mountianeers,"My experience is I live here and go to all the Football and Basketball games in Morgantown WV. We have a lot  of fine restaurants . Chetters Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Chili's, Long Horn Steak House and more all at university town center right off of  i79 exit 152 also a hotel there. The town center mall is right above it. Walmart ,Sams  and more."
2428,Date of experience: September 2015,30-Sep-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,A fantastic Gold Rush weekend in Morgantown.  WVU v. UM.,"Home football weekend for the Mountaineers. The town was buzzing.  Great tailgating, easy access to stadium and a fantastic crowd.   Unless you're a Terps fan."
2429,Date of experience: September 2015,29-Sep-15,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Great place to watch a football game!,"Have season tickets for the football games!  Expanding the concession stands so that is good.  The stadium is always under some construction to ""better"" it.  Seats are all good??.I've been high and low and for past many years open front row 200 section.  Kids always sit in lower 100 section.  No one ever complains!  Beautiful field.  Best WVU band ever!!!  Mountaineers jerseys and new colors are rocking!!  Not much in beer selections if you want beyond a traditional american beer like Bud or Michelob or Miller.  Three higher scale import drafts at a central located venue."
2430,Date of experience: September 2015,28-Sep-15,Big 12,West Virginia,3,WV Football,"The stadium was nice, but not as nice as others I have been to. Friendly people in the stands. I may have missed it, but compared to other universities, there was not much around this stadium as far as campus buildings. There was a ton of tailgating."
2431,Date of experience: September 2015,27-Sep-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,A Great Place to Join the Mountaineers,"Though we did have to wait to get into the stadium, it was worth the wait.  The stadium held about 60,000 + people, had good seating, food and drink options, and provided great afternoon entertainment.  The video board and sound system were easy to see and hear from our vantage point.  There was ample parking though the infrastructure didn't support the numbers of vehicles leaving the stadium after the event."
2432,Date of experience: September 2015,17-Sep-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Awesome!,WVU games provide a friendly energetic atmosphere with decent food options although at a high price. ..probably thanks to sodexo (food service operator).
2433,Date of experience: October 2014,16-Sep-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,No Bad Seats,Great view of the game from just about any seat in the stadium.  Tailgating is great before the games and Mountaineer fans are friendly
2434,Date of experience: September 2015,14-Sep-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Game day!,"Great stadium!!! Great atmosphere! Be prepared to walk to stadium. However, parking is plentiful and a great many business/school, etc offer parking in the  $15--$20 range."
2435,Date of experience: September 2015,10-Sep-15,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Let's GOOOO,Electric atmosphere!!!  Friendly fan base!  Construction at the East Gate made it a little hectic to get into the game!
2436,Date of experience: September 2015,9-Sep-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Start of 2015 WVU Football,Another great day to be a Mountaineer! The weather cooperated as the Mountaineers opened another season at Mountaineer Field where there is not a bad seat in the house.
2437,Date of experience: September 2015,8-Sep-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,family fun seating,Got tickets in  the alcohol free section. It was really nice. Security was tight. State police handled all alcohol issues if the staff couldn't. Lots of families and young kids. Really nice time. I would suggest the seat cushions. For some reason concessions had to pour every can into a cup. So lines were long and slow. Credit cards couldn't be used and the ATM line was very long all nite. Bring cash. And lots of it. Very well run security and good time.
2438,Date of experience: September 2015,7-Sep-15,Big 12,West Virginia,3,WVU Stadium,The stadium has construction on the east side and is squeezed in between a mountain side and a cliff. The WV fans were cordial.
2439,Date of experience: August 2015,1-Sep-15,Big 12,West Virginia,3,Swing and a miss,"Nice looking place, but It's all turf, even the infield and base paths.  The seating is good and they have a decent beer selection.  The food selection is not great.  Landscaping is terrible.  There are a couple of strange, sloping grass areas that make no sense whatsoever and look silly.  Buildings in the outfield have a flat roof and look more like a water treatment plant than a baseball facility.  Plus, the place is in the middle of no where at the far end of a shopping area."
2440,Date of experience: August 2015,1-Sep-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Milan Puskar Stadium,"Great fun and cool fans!  Facility is not the newest but, well maintained and improvements are underway."
2442,Date of experience: October 2014,12-Aug-15,Big 12,West Virginia,4,College football,It's a college foot ball field. It's in a cool town that's close to lots of things to do. We u is a decent team.
2443,Date of experience: November 2014,12-Aug-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,LET'S GO!!!,"One of the best places on Earth to take in a game. I have been to multiple college football venues, yes I'm biased, but this place offers everything. We, the fans, represent our team with passion and will cheer them on anywhere as we travel well. I absolutely love traveling through Ruby's parking lot and tailgating with the thousands of other WVU fans."
2445,Date of experience: November 2014,28-Jul-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Go EERS...,Nothing beats a wonderful day trip to see the Mountaineers play football. The stadium is nice and parking is a little bit of a hike but often the locals keep you pumped up on the trek there.
2446,Date of experience: October 2014,23-Jul-15,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Great Game Day,"The stadium at WVU ranks as one of the best in college football. With all due respect, I would rank them #2 east of the Mississippi with only the Horseshoe at Ohio State being only a sligfhtly more intense. I never miss a chance to see the Mountaineers on their home turf!!!!"
2447,Date of experience: October 2014,5-Jul-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Best college stadium and game day atmosphere,I love this stadium. I've been to Mountaineer Field at least 100 times. The game day atmosphere at Mountaineer Field is amazing and the best of any college football stadium! The tailgating at Mountaineer Field is second to none. I highly recommend partaking in a game day experience at Mountaineer Field.
2448,Date of experience: October 2014,2-Jul-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Mountaineer Country!,"Great atmosphere!  It's always fun when you spend the day at Mountaineer Field!  Tip: If you take the shuttle from the Coliseum, it makes for cheap parking, but make sure you get an early start on the way back or you'll be in line forever."
2449,Date of experience: October 2014,1-Jul-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Home of the Mountaineers,Great place to watch the WVU Mountaineers play football. There is tailgaiting in the parking lot before the games.
2451,Date of experience: November 2014,25-Jun-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Great place for College Football,"Not a bad seat in the house if you ask me.  I love it here.  Plenty of seating, bathrooms and vendors.  Great place to catch a football game."
2452,Date of experience: November 2014,21-Jun-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,A Great Venue For College Football.,"A great venue for college football. You get to see not only the WV Mountaineers but other historically elite college football teams like Oklahoma, Texas, Oklahoma State, Baylor, TCU, Texas Tech, Kansas State, and more. A great place for college football."
2453,Date of experience: November 2014,3-Jun-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Best venue around,Mountaineer Field host the best tail gate parties on the east coast. Every fan is happy and friendly.  When the Mountaineers score a touchdown everyone becomes family.
2455,Date of experience: November 2014,17-May-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,BEST EVER,"Went to two games this past season, first time in 20 years, improvements galore.  It is  the place to watch to college football!  Let's Go Mountaineer's!"
2456,Date of experience: September 2014,5-May-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,WVU all the way,"Gosh, you have not lived until you see the Pride of WV our band and the football team and the stadium and the tail gaiting is to die for"
2457,Date of experience: October 2014,29-Apr-15,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Always fun!,"We love to visit our daughter and tailgate before games. There's tailgating everywhere! The stadium is walking distance from many locations. They serve beer inside the stadium, which many schools do not. Lots of school spirit, clean, restrooms are close by.  Fans can be a little rowdy and obnoxious though. There are sections for families with no alcohol."
2459,Date of experience: December 2014,31-Mar-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,One of a Kind!,"I have been going to WVU Football games since I was young. I am a Mountaineer forever. If visiting from out of town, it will get a bit rowdy, so be ready. But we passionate only because we care."
2460,Date of experience: December 2014,25-Mar-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,The Best Football Experience!,"I've had season tickets for WVU since 1984. I love WVU football and Milan Puskar Stadium. This is a Morgantown institution, and there quite a few places to eat in the stadium, but only during games."
2462,Date of experience: November 2014,18-Feb-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,What a Football Field!,"The football field, concessions, and surroundings were amazing.  I truly love this field a hundred more times than Penn State.  All seats appeared to be excellent.  The Mountaineer is exciting to watch."
2463,Date of experience: November 2014,3-Feb-15,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Mecca.,"If you are a Mountaineer fan, this is Mecca. One of the loudest, proudest, places to see some great football. WVU football is like a religion in this state."
2464,Date of experience: September 2014,30-Dec-14,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Go Mountaineers!!,Great place to watch the Mountaineers play! The atmosphere is great both inside and outside the game. There are no bad seats in the stadium.
2465,Date of experience: November 2014,9-Dec-14,Big 12,West Virginia,3,Typical stadium food.,"If your at the game, there isn't any place else to eat.  Service very slow, but then volunteers.  Large crowds when stadium is full."
2466,Date of experience: November 2014,24-Nov-14,Big 12,West Virginia,4,WV/Kstate Football,Enjoyed the ride on the PRT to the stadium.  Very disorganized but the students gave us advice and were very polite.  It was very cold during game so crowd was not near capacity but it was fun and we were treated well.
2469,Date of experience: October 2014,3-Nov-14,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Great Venue,"Mountaineer Field provides a perfect setting to watch a football game. It is large, has ample bathroom facilities, shopping, food, and drinks. When in Morgantown, you must visit the stadium for a Mountaineer game.Parking is available with parking passes or off property in many locations for a fee."
2470,Date of experience: September 2014,3-Nov-14,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Best college football experience,No one does tailgating and football like the Mountaineers.  There is plenty of parking close to the stadium (talk to a local and find some great spots for free!) and it is worth it to park a little ways away from the stadium so you can experience walking through the sea of RV's and extreme tailgates outside the stadium.  I can almost guarantee you can walk up to any tailgate and immediately be welcomed in and offered some great food and a refreshing beverage (probably of the adult nature from a freshly tapped keg).  A must-experience for any college football enthusiast!
2471,Date of experience: November 2014,2-Nov-14,Big 12,West Virginia,5,WVU vs TCU game,Always enjoy Mountaineer games. Great experience. Only thing that could have made it better is if we had won. Lost by 1 point.
2472,Date of experience: October 2014,30-Oct-14,Big 12,West Virginia,4,a fun time for football tailgating,"Mountaineer Field is definitely a great place to tailgate! There's a lot of room to bring your car and have a great time with some other fans. And then afterwards we all move towards the RV lots and kept the party going.Was able to go to a game in one of the suites, and for a college football stadium, the suites were very nice and modern. The food was only okay, but I think expectations have to be managed for a college football stadium that isn't some huge moneymaker (like at Alabama).There are a few hotels that are very close to the stadium, and they also run shuttles back-and-forth so you don't have to deal with parking issues. I appreciate that.Mountaineer Field is a fun time."
2474,Date of experience: October 2014,7-Oct-14,Big 12,West Virginia,5,WVU vs. Kansas,"Great time in Morgantown watching the Mountaineers win!! We go to a game every year, can't beleive how much has changed in Mon. County."
2475,Date of experience: October 2014,5-Oct-14,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Super football experience!,"This has got to be one of the best college football experiences. The tailgating is amazing. The band is spectacular. They form the school logo and the outline of the state while playing wonderful music. WVU has many football traditions that you will quickly get caught up in. Stay until the very end of the game and sway to John Denver's ""Country Roads."""
2476,Date of experience: September 2014,23-Sep-14,Big 12,West Virginia,5,"Welcoming, hospitable and gracious WVU fans","We attended the West Virginia University vs. University of Oklahoma football game.  Although we wore Oklahoma shirts, the WVU fans invited us to their tailgate parties and shared their food and drink.  At least 100 WVU folks said, ""Welcome to Morgantown.""  Even after we won, they were classy and hospitable.  The field was nice but the people made it special!"
2477,Date of experience: September 2014,23-Sep-14,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Remarkable Experience for Visiting Fans,"Every fan's experience at a football game is different. This is ours. We went to the Oklahoma vs West Virginia football game and took the southern route from Northern VA. This put us in the middle of a two-hour cell coverage Dead Zone. We could tell after we started seeing abandoned vans by the side of the road. We slowed to look at one and could see a skeleton in the driver's seat with a phone clutched in its bony fingers.  We returned by the northern route thru the People's Republic of Maryland and had better coverage. Getting to the stadium is easy. We followed the helpful instructions from the game day brochure published by the Morgantown Visitor's Bureau.  Mountaineer Mall offers free parking and a round-trip shuttle bus for only $3.00. Exact change is recommended, the driver doesn't make change and instead gives you a bus credit that's useless if you're from out of town. When you reach the mall, drive around the rim road counter-clockwise and go down the hill. When you get to an area with a Chinese buffet, that's the shuttle lot.  The shuttle bus let us off about 300 yds. from the front gate. The amazing thing to me was how friendly WV fans were. We were repeatedly welcomed to the game, even though we were wearing our Sooner shirts. People shook our hands, yelled greetings and generally make us feel welcome as we walked through the center of the WV tailgating area. You would have thought we were handing out free Obama phones. Seat in the stadium are bleachers, which wasn't a problem since everyone insisted on standing up during the game, which is not my favorite. Getting into the stadium was simple, no TSA-style groping. Bags are limited to 12 X 12 X 12. No coolers. You can bring water and soft drinks in if in an unopened plastic container. Food, too, for that matter.  Even more remarkable, after the game the WV fans were STILL friendly. I couldn't believe it. I don't recall ever being this generous when I was in Norman. It's one thing to be nice before the game, but it's completely different to maintain your sunny disposition after your team has been beaten. The trip back to the parking lot was a misery. 20 minutes to the stadium, 1.5 hours going back. No need to rush to get on the first bus, because the heavy traffic caused them all to arrive about the same time at the lot. If you go to a late game and have a long drive, you might consider spending the night."
2478,Date of experience: September 2014,22-Sep-14,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Awesome,The stadium has 61000 folks cheering on the mountaineers. Its easy to find and parking surrounds the stadium.
2479,Date of experience: September 2014,22-Sep-14,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Mountaineer Field = Marvelous Fun,"Visited Mountaineer Field on a beautiful September Saturday night for the OU vs WVV game (Boomer Sooner).  Loved the setting and the stadium. We had mixed results on the concessions - pretzel with cheese was fresh and good; pizza tasted like it was five days old-cold, not much sauce or cheese and crust was tough.  The band was really good - a great visit for a Big 12 road game."
2480,Date of experience: September 2014,21-Sep-14,Big 12,West Virginia,5,wvu vs oklahoma,no better atmosphere in college football!!!! to bad we didn't win. stripe the stadium game and the usual loud and great crowd!!!!! lets go mountaineers!!!!!!
2481,Date of experience: August 2014,2-Sep-14,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Let's go...,Love Mountaineer Field.  Easy to get around. Be sure and rent a seat for the game. Helps a group as ell as you back.  Helps you to claim your part of the bench.
2482,Date of experience: December 2013,1-Sep-14,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Great Stadium,"Mountaineer filed is a little old and lack amenities, but it one of the easiest stadiums to get in and out of."
2485,Date of experience: October 2013,30-Jul-14,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Where the magic happens,Great field where wonderful things happen. The team really brings it to life. Any chance to make it to a game go for it.
2486,Date of experience: October 2013,30-Jun-14,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Texas Tech vs. West Virginia,Friendliest people we have met in all of our football outings. There was a table at the game to welcome us and asked if we needed anything. It was a pleasant surprise to not meet a hostile group of fans.
2489,Date of experience: November 2013,9-Feb-14,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Classic,A classic for any Mountaineer football fan. Energy in Morgantown on gamedays is tangible. Go Mountaineers!
2490,Date of experience: September 2013,25-Jan-14,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Great time,Its always a great time to watch a live WVU football game with fellow fans at Mountaineer field. Lets gooooooo Mountaineers!!!
2491,Date of experience: October 2013,28-Nov-13,Big 12,West Virginia,3,Average Stadium,"We arrived in town two hours before the game thinking that would give us plenty of time to park and get to the stadium, but were we wrong!  People were parking on the shoulder of the road, and any open place they could find a spot!  Before leaving home we checked out the website for parking information, but it wasn't very helpful for someone who isn't familiar with the campus.  We finally found a parking lot where Boy Scouts were collecting money, so we parked there.  The university really needs to have better parking information on the website.We were a bit concerned about what to expect after hearing/seeing all the announcements regarding drinking too much alcohol and being a good sport.  Our concerns were heightened since we were visitors, but not sitting in the visitor's section.  Our fears were settled when the person sitting next to my husband asked if we were from Texas (it was the Texas Tech game) and my husband responded yes.  The man then said:  Welcome to Morgantown!  We had no problems in the stands!We never had to wait long for concessions or restrooms.  They have cushioned seats available for rent.  We were surprised to see the amount of tailgating that was going on prior to the game.  Due to the amount of traffic we decided to take our time trying to leave town.  We stopped to get some snacks and then sat in our car about an hour before deciding to leave.  That didn't really help as there are so few ways to get out of Morgantown, and coupled with the rain that moved it, it took us what seems forever to get out of town.Nothing set this stadium apart from any other that we've been too.  We're just glad our team won, even if it meant ruining homecoming for WVU!  I would suggest allowing ample to time to find parking if you aren't familiar with Morgantown/the campus."
2492,Date of experience: October 2013,27-Nov-13,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Great place to watch some college football,Mountaineer Field has some of the best fans in college football. They also have some great football being played on the field. The stadium is still a work in progress and is constantly being improved. Go see a game if you can.
2493,Date of experience: November 2013,20-Nov-13,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Let's go Mountaineer's,"Sadly, the team lost.  But, it was a great game.  Great sound,, great seats.  Wow, can this group have a wild tailgate.  Whew."
2494,Date of experience: October 2013,6-Nov-13,Big 12,West Virginia,5,The best place to be in West Virginia on a Football Game Day,"I'm a WVU graduate, so I might be a little biased, but Mountaineer Field is one of the nations great college football stadiums.  From the passionate WVU fans to the singing of ""Country Roads"" at the end of the game.  It is an experience worth being a part of.  Come and be a part of some of the greatest tailgating in the country."
2495,Date of experience: October 2013,22-Oct-13,Big 12,West Virginia,5,LETS GO........,"Of course you wouldnt want to miss a Saturday afternoon in Morgantown, WV for a WVU football game would you ? No of course you wouldnt... This stadium has plenty of history and memories that are made here. Most out of towners that visit leave with a smile on their face with the experience they have encountered from our fans and the treatment."
2496,Date of experience: October 2013,21-Oct-13,Big 12,West Virginia,5,WVU Football Stadium,"The stadium is large, seats allow for great views.  Tailgating atmosphere is fantastic.   I only wish there was more parking closer to the stadium. Yes, I am a Mountaineer fan.  Lets go Mountaineers !"
2497,Date of experience: September 2013,7-Oct-13,Big 12,West Virginia,5,"Visitor's Sections 98, 99 and 100 are good seats!","Visitor's section has the afternoon sun behind them, so the view of the field is not hampered by looking into the sun. Enjoyed the game, even though the Mountaineers upset the Cowboys!"
2498,Date of experience: September 2013,29-Sep-13,Big 12,West Virginia,5,One of my favorite places,There is nothing better than game day in Morgantown. Love the tailgating experience and saw the man trip for the first time. Let's go Mountaineers!
2499,Date of experience: September 2013,9-Sep-13,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Great place for football but it could use a few changes,I have always enjoyed coming to Mountaineer field for football games. I was here when John Denver came to open the stadium and sing Country Roads. The bathrooms need upgraded and they need to sell chicken sandwiches or wings. Also they should offer regular and decaf tea when the weather gets cooler just like they offer coffee. I am glad to see there are alcohol free sections which the staff kept close eye on . I think you should be able to bring an umbrella in the stadium as long as you dont use it in the stands in case it rains so you can be protected when you take the long hike out. { They permit this at the Coliseum and I have never seen any problems there}.It is a great place to go for football games but it can use a few adjustments.
2500,Date of experience: August 2013,5-Sep-13,Big 12,West Virginia,4,"Let's Go, Mountaineers!","What better way to spend a Saturday than at a WVU football game.  There's a variety of food, souvenir shops, and even a museum.  But the real fun is the game.  I've been to other college games (Marshall, UK) and have even seen Division championship games.  But they don't even come close to the excitement that the fans create here."
2501,Date of experience: August 2013,2-Sep-13,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Stadium better than the team,Easy to enter/exit but the concourse area is overcrowded and poorly designed.  They need more room to get from seats to facilities without fighting the crowds
2502,Date of experience: November 2012,19-Aug-13,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Do not pass on the opportunity to see a home game,"Experiencing a home game in this stadium is an unforgettable experience. With no pro sports franchises in the entire state, the Mountaineers represent the pride of the entire population on game day. The part starts at daybreak on game day - regardless whether the kick-off is noon or 10pm. Don't get spotted near a couch after a win - you could possibly end up in jail for the night."
2503,Date of experience: October 2012,29-Jul-13,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Electric Atmosphere,"Game day at Mountaineer Field is a special one.  One of the largest tailgating experiences in the country, you will find something fun for both adults and kids.  The heavenly smells from the grillI, folks chillin having some pre-game beverages, kids throwing footballs around, it is truly a great time.  Tailgating at Mountaineer Field is a second profession to some.  It's that important.  Imagine a cool, sunny Fall day with an upwards of 60,000 like minded folks and you will be in for some awesome memories.  Once inside the stadium and The Pride of West West Virginia Marching Band hits the field the adrenalin starts pumping.  Next, the enterance music for the our guys...The Mountaineers.  When the crowd gets cranked up, the hair on your arms and neck will stand on end.  C'mon to Morgantown, I promise you'll have a great time."
2504,Date of experience: September 2012,29-Jul-13,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Great place for football,Every seat in the house is great. People really get into football here. the WVU Mountaineer Band is the best there is. Wonderful entertainment. The tailgating is fun and gets you in the mood for the game. Best game in town.

2512,Date of experience: November 2012,10-Feb-13,Big 12,West Virginia,5,LOVE Mountaineer Stadium!,"Mountaineer Stadium is an excellent, upper class stadium! Cheering on the WVU Mountaineers or watching the Morgantown Band Spectacular & your child is in it, The opportunity to march on the field is a once in a lifetime experience for a HS student. Love going to the games at Milan Puskar Stadium! It is one of many Gems of WV."
2513,Date of experience: November 2012,29-Jan-13,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Mountaineer fans know how to do it right.,"We visited West Virginia University last November and had a great time at the football game.  The Mountaineer tailgate scene was great, filled with passionate fans.  The scene inside the stadium was electric as the intro music played and the team stormed the field.The weather was very cold and we purchased a couple hot chocolates which were satisfying.  However, early in the 4th quarter, concessions ran out of tops for the hot chocolate and couldn't sell anymore.  It got colder and colder as the sun went down, and then the game just happened to go into overtime!  The game we attended was widely regarded as one of the most exciting games of the entire season across the nation (TCU/WVU game), which offset the cold a bit as the action was exciting, so we were very happy overall.We were also entertained by the fans in front of us.  They were drinking, laughing, and having a good time.  One woman stood up on the bleachers during a timeout and started dancing while a hip-hop beat was playing.  A very large guy came up to her and started dancing, slowly unzipping and taking off his coat, while squating down low and trying to swivel his hips.  It was hilarious!  Mountaineer fans know how to get loose and have fun!"
2514,Date of experience: November 2012,15-Jan-13,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Good place / fans to watch a game,"Noting not to like, basic stadium, stay close or parking can be an issue if you don't have a pass, walking over from Hampton Hotel was perfect.,"

2523,Date of experience: September 2012,6-Oct-12,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Highly recommend the trip,"While there were many signs around town admonishing the students to be classy we found everyone in Morgantown to be incredibly friendly.  We were also warned that the fans could be rowdy, but we found the WVU fans to be very nice.  Morgantown is a great place to go for a football game in a very comfortable stadium."
2525,Date of experience: September 2012,26-Sep-12,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Typical Stadium Food,"Sporting events and overpriced Hotdogs go hand in hand!  But, when cheering on WVU it is worth it!

2532,Date of experience: December 2011,9-Jul-12,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Nothing quite like a football Saturday in Morgantown,"The State of WV has no professional teams so the WVU Mountaineers get center stage 6-7 times each year. Unless you have been to the stadium and felt the electricity of a game, you can't possibly understand it. Yes, the fans are loud and the students sometimes rowdy, they taunt opponents and have been known to burn a couch or two following a game but, this is the place to be on those special football Saturdays.  It's not for everyone and certainly not for the timid or faint of heart and if your cup of tea is watching an Ivy League game in a ho-hum tranquil and sophisticated setting, don't go to Morgantown.  It is crazy loud and nearly explodes with enthusiasm and energy when the team, cheerleaders, the band and the Mountaineer mascot hits the field. Bring a helmet and come join us??that is, if you dare!"
2534,Date of experience: September 2011,11-Jun-12,Big 12,West Virginia,5,greatest place on earth,great place to watch football.  not a bad seat in the place.
2536,Date of experience: September 2011,18-May-12,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Bring on the Mountaineer's,A very exciting place to be when the Mountaineers are playing at home.located across the street from the Residence Inn by Marriott - The fans sure know how to tailgate! All you see is gold.
2541,Date of experience: September 2011,18-Nov-11,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Great place to see a game,The fans get into the games. The field layout is good to watch a game. One of the best fan bases anywhere.
2542,Date of experience: September 2011,13-Nov-11,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Go Mountaineers!,Great football atmosphere even if you are not an alum.  Get there early enough to see the Pride of WV marching band prior to the game.
2543,Date of experience: November 2011,10-Nov-11,Big 12,West Virginia,5,What Saturdays in Fall are all about,"Had a great day at Mountaineer field watching a college football rival between WVU and Louisville. Even though the Mountaineers came up short, the weather was perfect and the atmosphere electric. If you've ever seen a college football game live, you know what I mean."
2544,Date of experience: September 2011,31-Oct-11,Big 12,West Virginia,4,Good tailgating,Friendly place.Good bus service to stadium. Restrooms clean at the bus area.
2545,Date of experience: October 2010,13-Jun-11,Big 12,West Virginia,5,Great atmosphere!,"I went to my first Mountaineers game last fall.  The atmosphere in this place was electric.  Being a Canadian, I had not been exposed to this sort of sporting event enthusiasm.  It was great fun!"
2548,Date of experience: September 2021,5-Jan-22,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Get there early,"Our first football game in Illinois was here against Rutgers. (The game after Rutgers went to 9OT's.) We were in the first row of the endzone, and it was so much fun. We got there a little bit after the game started. We had perfect view of the whole field. The jumbotron was directly behind us, and we were able to see everything. If you get there before the game, the trombones perform in the stairway. The lines were never too long to grab food and drinks."
2549,Date of experience: October 2021,21-Oct-21,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Where Grange and Butkus played,"As a 1962 graduate of the University of Illinois, I recall sitting at the top of the upper deck on the east side of Memorial Stadium to watch the football games as a freshman in 1958. Remember Army's Lonesome End? Few stadiums can boast of the history of Memorial Stadium, which was opened in 1923 as a memorial to the university students who died in World War I with their names engraved on the nearly 200 pillars surrounding the stadium's facade. It was dedicated on October 18, 1924, when Illinois hosted Michigan for homecoming and Red Grange scored five touchdowns during a 39-14 victory that was one of the greatest single-game performances in football history. As a reporter for the Champaign-Urbana Courier in 1963, I covered Dick Butkus and an Illini team that won the Big Ten championship and the Rose Bowl. Today, the stadium's capacity has been reduced from 70,000 to 60,670, the playing surface is named in honor of former coach Bob Zuppke, a 12-foot tall statue of Red Grange stands on the west side of the stadium, a new press box and luxury suites are located atop the west balcony, a color scoreboard has been installed at the north end of the stadium, more seating was added to the north and south ends of the stadium and tailgating has become a popular feature of game day on the west side of the stadium. Unfortunately, the university's longtime symbol, Chief Illiniwek, a popular halftime attraction who was as much a part of Illinois' marching band as the band itself, is gone."
2551,Date of experience: November 2019,20-Jan-20,Big Ten,Illinois,5,nice upgrades,"It had been a few years since I set foot in Memorial Stadium. I can only take so much bad football.I was impressed with the upgrades to the stadium since my last visit. While the Illini got whacked badly by a Northwestern team they were supposed to crush, at least beer sales helped ease the pain. No more sneaking in booze...like I heard other people do."
2552,Date of experience: November 2019,5-Nov-19,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Great Venue for Big 10 Illini Football!,Memorial Stadium is a great place - family friendly- to see an Illini football game. Seats are great in most any part of the stadium.
2553,Date of experience: October 2019,30-Oct-19,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Michigan road football game,Very impressive stadium great atmosphere throughout walking among all the fans tailgating. Would attend another game there. Had a good time was he able to use Uber to get from bar to bar and back to the hotel.
2554,Date of experience: September 2019,15-Oct-19,Big Ten,Illinois,4,Friendly fans,"As visiting fans not everyone, everywhere is as friendly as Illini fans have been in our visits. Thanks Illinois fans for keeping it family friendly."
2555,Date of experience: September 2019,24-Sep-19,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Great help,Went to Memorial Stadium for a football game and the whole crew was very helpful. Concession stand were upbeat and helpful with everything.
2556,Date of experience: August 2019,20-Aug-19,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Have you heard the story about the bulldozer?,"Memorial Stadium in Champaign, Illinois, the home of the University of Illinois' football team, has been steeped in legend ever since Red Grange scored five touchdowns in a 39-14 homecoming victory over Michigan on the day the stadium was officially dedicated on October 18, 1924. Celebrated sportswriter Grantland Rice, who created the legend of ""The Galloping Ghost of Illinois,"" said it was one of the greatest single-game performances in football history. Grange's statue now stands on the west side of the stadium. There have been other changes since Grange's day, since I was a student in 1958-1962, since Dick Butkus led the Illini to the Rose Bowl. A memorial to the university students who died in World War I, whose names are engraved on the nearly 200 pillars surrounding the stadium's facade, it was completed in 1923 at a cost of $1.7 million. It once had a capacity of over 70,000 with  double-decked stands on the east and west sidelines. The single-decked horseshoe around the south end zone and a large student section near the north end zone were added later. Did you know that during the original construction a bulldozer sank into the field during a heavy rain. It was decided that the expense of removing the bulldozer would have been greater than leaving it buried under the field. It remains there today. In 1967, the old, dilapidated, green-painted, wooden press box at the top of the west balcony was replaced by an ultra-modern, state-of-the-art, glass encased press box. In 2013, the main scoreboard was replaced by a new Daktronics video board that measures 36 by 96 feet. But I still miss some things...like the student card sections in the lower east stand and the upper west balcony and Chief Illiniwek, whose presence with the Illini Marching Band at halftime was an emotional experience for thousands of students and alumni."
2560,Date of experience: October 2018,23-Feb-19,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Orange and Blue - occasionally sing the blues.,"Memorial Stadium is the fine football venue for Illinois' flagship university.  It is home to the Big Ten's Fighting Illini and renowned Marching Illini band.  Thrilling when waves of fans call and response chant ""I-L-L!"" to be answered with "" I-N-I!""   Sadly, the stadium is host to no mascot at the current time since political correctness strives to erase ""The Chief""  and even the music, the ""Three in One"" from alumni memories"
2561,Date of experience: November 2018,7-Nov-18,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Dad's Weekend,My son and I tailgated and then went to Illinois vs. Minnesota football game. Tailgating was a blast in a nice open field west of the stadium. Inside the view of the game was great and there was a large TV screen to see the reviews. It was a great experience.
2562,Date of experience: October 2018,16-Oct-18,Big Ten,Illinois,4,Friendly Fanbase & Pleasing Architectural Stadium,"We enjoyed our visit to Memorial Stadium.  Our team that we follow was a visitor at this venue.  The fans were friendly and not obnoxious to opposing teams fans (we have been to some stadiums that they were not as accommodating).  We enjoyed the architectural features of this stadium.  It is built to look a lot like the coliseum.  We were seated in the Horseshoe section of the stadium.  That is the endzone that is in front of the large stadium monitors.  Our seats were very good for endzone seats, but having to turn around to view the replays got to be a bit tedious.  It would be better to be seated on the sides so not to have that issue.  But overall we truly enjoyed our experience here at this stadium.  The Illini did a nice job putting together a very good game day experience."
2563,Date of experience: October 2018,15-Oct-18,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Beautiful Stadium,Everyone needs to visit this beautiful stadium and see some Illini Football and the Marching Illini play! Homecoming games are fun..tailgating is very popular and open to all!Parking is tough on big game days. Worth it to pay for State Farm center parking. The stadium is seldom filled to capacity.  Maybe a couple more years and the Fighting Illini will be great again!
2564,Date of experience: October 2018,15-Oct-18,Big Ten,Illinois,5,"Great tailgating, easy in and out","Always a great place to see a game, home or away.  The food stands are slow so go between quarters, and if it's cold, get your hot beverage early because they usually run out.  There is tons of parking space with plenty of room for tailgating shelters."
2566,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Sep-18,Big Ten,Illinois,4,Kid Friendly Environment especially pre-game,"Our three kids enjoyed their first ever Illini football game.  We arrived around 8:15 for an 11:00 game and the kids enjoyed all the pre-game activities in Grange Grove.  Kids are 7, 10, and 12.  They were giving away t-shirts, posters, other trinkets, and had 5 former Illini signing autographs.  Kids also enjoyed the player/coach/band/cheerleader walk.  You can bring food into Grange Grove and set up tent or whatever you'd like.  Plenty of room to throw around a football or any other games you want to play.  We sat on the East side of stadium and row 46 which is high enough to be under the upper level thus out of potential rain and sun.  Plenty of concessions including Avantis and Portillos.  Very minimal items can be brought into stadium and essentially everything has to be in a clear bag.    We parked to the South of State Farm center for $20.  About a 5 minute walk to Grange Grove."
2568,Date of experience: October 2017,27-May-18,Big Ten,Illinois,3,In a good year...,"The pre-game actiivities are fun.  If the Illini are winning, it can be great.  Otherwise expect poor crowd turnout,"
2570,Date of experience: November 2017,11-Dec-17,Big Ten,Illinois,4,Saturday Big 10 football,"We purchased some nice Illinois fans great tickets for our Badgers game. We parked about a block away, the athletic dept was very nice in answering our parking questions during the week, so Saturday parking was simple, even with many roads under construction or closed for the tent city event.Getting inside was quick, no long security lines, finding the seats was made easy with the online seat map. The weather was cold, rainy and just miserable with late snow,, but otherwise a very nice experience. Everyone had about 3 seats to themselves since that weather did keep normal folks at home.No jump around , but the Illini band did try to keep the home folks entertained."
2571,Date of experience: September 2017,2-Oct-17,Big Ten,Illinois,4,"Nice stadium, lots of fun and reasonable prices.","The seats are a little hard and you might be a little sore by the end of it so suggest to bring a seat cushion. View seems pretty good from most areas.  Also, if you are using game day parking be prepared for a bit of a hike."
2572,Date of experience: September 2017,2-Oct-17,Big Ten,Illinois,4,Football game,"Stadium seats are comfortable, typical price on food and drinks. Now the Illini just need to get their football program together."
2573,Date of experience: September 2017,1-Oct-17,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Watched Nebraska & Illinois Game - Fun experience!,We ended up getting last minute tickets to the game and we really enjoyed sitting behind the endzone on the south end. Nice stadium and atmosphere. Didn't have a dog in this fight but enjoyed watching some football and hanging out with our big group of family and friends for a wedding that weekend.
2574,Date of experience: September 2017,30-Sep-17,Big Ten,Illinois,3,Lots of Fun,Finally a Coke stadium!!  Food was good. We had chicken strips and fries. The speaker system badly needs updated. Couldn't understand anything said. Love the area design for the band.  Bathrooms could use updating. Men's restroom needs a better sign system so they can be found.
2575,Date of experience: September 2017,13-Sep-17,Big Ten,Illinois,4,"Great Place, Cheap tickets","So if you're a townie new to the CU area (me) and not an alumni of the UofI (same again) I'd highly recommend catching a game at memorial stadium. The tickets were a great price for the seats, plenty of parking for free within a few blocks walk, food is not overpriced. My kids had a blast and it was a fun way to spend a Saturday evening."
2577,Date of experience: October 2016,4-May-17,Big Ten,Illinois,4,Nice Stadium for Football,I've been to several football games here and a few special events.  The place is good and not too confusing to navigate.  The refreshments aren't too expensive and the staff is helpful and courteous.
2578,Date of experience: October 2016,23-Mar-17,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Where the Galloping Ghost ran to immortality,"As a freshman at the University of Illinois in 1958, I dreamed of attending my first college football game at Memorial Stadium. Built in 1923 as a memorial to university students who died in World War I, with their names engraved on the 200 columns surrounding the stadium's facade, its U-shaped design was modeled after Harvard Stadium. As an historian, I was aware that Memorial Stadium was where Red Grange scored six touchdowns, including four in the first 12 minutes, as Illinois defeated Michigan 39-14 on October 18, 1924, the day that the stadium was officially dedicated. After recording one of the greatest single-game performances in football history, Grange was called ""The Galloping Ghost"" by famed New York sportswriter Grantland Rice. This is the stadium where Bob Zuppke coached. This is the stadium where Chief Illiniwek danced. This is the stadium that once had a capacity of 71,227. When I purchased by student season ticket, I specifically requested a seat at the top of east balcony, where I could get a panoramic view of the entire stadium--and see how Chief Illiniwek navigated through the Illini Marching Band at halftime. It was so much fun in those days, during the Dick Butkus era in 1963 and 1964, and it is becoming fun again in the wake of a $100 million renovation that produced a large press box on top of the west balcony, luxury suites, new restrooms, new concession stands, improved concourses, a new scoreboard, a Colonnades Club for major donors and alumni, a statue of Grange on the west side, a tailgating area, a new 5,000-seat student section in the North end zone and a new head football coach in Lovie Smith. Memorial Stadium also plays host to the Illinois High School Association's football championships. As an Illinois graduate, I can honestly say that returning to the campus for homecoming is once again a weekend event to look forward to."
2579,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Mar-17,Big Ten,Illinois,5,"Memorial Stadium, Champaign Illinois, one of the finest stadiums in the entire country!","I feel like I am nearly an expert on stadiums and Arenas since I've worked in so many of them all over the country. I have worked many pro stadiums and Collegiate stadiums and there are many excellent stadiums in the USA.  However, Memorial Stadium is in my opinion the most beautiful Stadium both inside and out, the architect, contractors and Tradesmen who put it together got it right!  Upgrades in the last decade have made it even better than it once was now you can see LED lighting on the Magnificent columns at night in different colors and the exterior is spectacular. Whether you are an Illini fan or not, this Stadium should be on your list of must visit venues to experience in your lifetime!  There is a large area surrounding Memorial Stadium which always has lively tailgate parties going pregame and postgame and that of course is part of the experience as well. The fighting Illini have had a few off years for the program but with Lovie Smith now the coach we look forward to better times, more exciting games and better results, so get your tickets while you can and experienced one of the best college venues in the country Memorial Stadium."
2581,Date of experience: October 2016,22-Feb-17,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Sporting Event Energy,Good place to watch the Illini play. It does not matter if you are in the cheap seats or one of the suites. The energy is contagious.
2582,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Feb-17,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Very clean and staff is very friendly,It was a nice place to visit.  Everyone that worked there were very friendly and helpful and getting us where we needed to be.
2583,Date of experience: October 2016,22-Jan-17,Big Ten,Illinois,4,Fun for football games: now if the U of I team can win?!,Fun to attend games here.  Need to update their food stands with choices and faster service.  But it's a fun college football day overall!
2585,Date of experience: November 2016,21-Nov-16,Big Ten,Illinois,3,Decent stadium to see a game,"Lacking the atmosphere of many of the other Big Ten stadiums, but they've had some down years. Luckily, I was up in a suite on a cold day. Staff was excellent."
2586,Date of experience: November 2016,21-Nov-16,Big Ten,Illinois,3,Looks great from the outside,The outside looks great with the pillars and whatnot. The inside probably would be a little more eventful if the team playing there was a little better.
2587,Date of experience: November 2016,13-Nov-16,Big Ten,Illinois,4,Nice venue,"Went down with my wife for the U of I game against Michigan State. Unfortunately, we lost which put a damper on an otherwise beautiful day. We enjoyed a nice stroll around campus the evening before the game. It is a pretty campus. I have to say it is the first campus I have seen that has a large cemetery on the grounds!The stadium is a little dated but pretty cool. They have a decent big screen system for replay, etc. We had awesome seats behind the MSU bench for a very reasonable price through StubHub.I do have to mention that I was a little surprised at the lack of a friendly welcome from almost everyone, both during our walk and on game day. I go to many away games and almost always there is friendly banter with the visitors (we were sporting our Spartan gear so it was no secret) or at least a ""Hi, welcome to..."" from the home fans."
2588,Date of experience: November 2016,7-Nov-16,Big Ten,Illinois,3,Nice venue,"Enjoyed a game here, even better that Illini won.  But not the same as some of the other Big Ten venues like Madison. Lacking in atmosphere"
2589,Date of experience: October 2016,19-Oct-16,Big Ten,Illinois,4,Great views for football and marching bands,Not a bad seat for watching the Fighting a Illini for a marching band competition. You cannot bring any food or beverages into the stadium. :-(
2590,Date of experience: October 2016,9-Oct-16,Big Ten,Illinois,4,Couldnt understand the announcer,"Nice stadium.  More elevator availability would be nice.  The person on the PA has a deep voice, but he does not enunciate...so no one could understand a word he said.The big screen is crisp and clear, but the color is off.  It was not ORANGE, it was RED.Too bad the Illini did not win!   And, the stands were far from full."
2591,Date of experience: September 2016,2-Oct-16,Big Ten,Illinois,4,nice place to watch a game,a very nice college stadium.  not overly big so there are virtually no bad tickets.  lots of food options and a great way to spend a fall afternoon.
2593,Date of experience: September 2016,26-Sep-16,Big Ten,Illinois,4,Football is Back!!,"Visited Memorial Stadium for the first time since 2002!! The last time the Bears used the stadium for their home games while Soldier Field was being renovated.  This time I was there for a college game. The place was sold out, a first since 201.  It was a night game so we didn't have to worry about the sun as much as most day games.  The atmosphere was great!  The crowd was into it as the Fighting Illini was taking on #22 ranked North Carolina.  College football is the best.  Grange Grove is a must see and the party there doesn't stop. Parking in the pay parking was a pain, if you can prepay to get closer do it.  The evening was great!! The student section is so interesting and They always have a message.Can't wait to go back!!"
2594,Date of experience: September 2016,20-Sep-16,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Awesome stadium but football game was terrible,"This is a beautiful stadium built in 1924 and renovated in 2008.  The huge wide screen at the end of the field is fantastic way to watch replays, even if the football game was a disaster.  Neat to see a stadium that still has character and history."
2595,Date of experience: September 2016,16-Sep-16,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Historic and Classic Red Brick Memorial Stadium,"Classic design features which have not been ruined like Soldier Field. Large clean restrooms. Colonnade seating is my favorite, drinks and Hickory River what more could you ask for?"
2596,Date of experience: September 2016,13-Sep-16,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Electric!,"I as at the stadium for the Fighting Illini vs North Carolina game last Saturday, though we lost, the atmosphere was great. Great fans!"
2597,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Great night for football,"Even though the Illini didn't win the game, it still was a fun evening with the concerts in Grange Grove before the game and the halftime entertainment along with some exciting football plays."
2598,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Definitely Worth a Look,"The stadium was constructed shortly after WWI and is dedicated to our military lost during the war. Today the dedication has grown to include those lost in other wars, but it remains a terrific memorial to all. A few years ago the stadium was renovated to modernize the facilities, including premium boxes at the top of the stadium, and this year a beer-garden has opened on the grounds on game days. The latter, in the ""Grange Grove"" immediately outside the stadium, is a long-needed addition to the site."
2599,Date of experience: September 2016,11-Sep-16,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Very Nice Venue,"Enjoys a sold out U of I football game last evening.  Very impressive facility, a place an Illinoisan can be proud of, when we so desperately need to restore in our State."
2600,Date of experience: September 2016,8-Sep-16,Big Ten,Illinois,3,Football weekend,"The stadium is really pretty in that it is an older stadium.  The outside is nice with statues, gates, etc.  There are some nice tailgating areas.  The downside is that the upper level is a nightmare to get to.  Do not even attempt to go if you have an older person in your party.  There are no handrails and the stairs are pretty steep.  In addition, you have to walk up a ramp that goes on forever.  It is only an issue for older people or if you are handicapped or disabled.  That being said, it is a pretty stadium and appeared to be well maintained- except it needs to be updated with handrails and assistance up the ramp."
2601,Date of experience: September 2016,7-Sep-16,Big Ten,Illinois,5,"Sit on the ""Home"" side!!","Visitor side has blistering sun all game long...never a wait for concessions, the pre-game tailgate on First Street is top notch.  Love the big time college football experience, but on a smaller (45k) level...real ""Americana"" type stuff here...love it"
2602,Date of experience: November 2015,21-Aug-16,Big Ten,Illinois,2,"Great Venue, Awful Act","Memorial Stadium is a great place to see a football game and with all the improvements they have made, it has gotten even better. It is steeped in history and is beautiful. The only problem is that the University of Illinois has continued to field one awful team after another for most of the past 50 years. Sure, they have had their ""flashes"" of brilliance but by an far the teams have been so bad that the only reason to go to a game is to see a good and many times great opposing team play some really good football. Illinois is not a football school. It is a drinking school with a football problem."
2603,Date of experience: September 2015,15-Aug-16,Big Ten,Illinois,2,First Home Football Game,It's great that they're up on sheltering people in place once a storm hits. What about using Megaphones/PA's stating there is a severe thunderstorm warning before people enter the stadium? Perhaps allowing spectators the opportunity to get to a more accommodating places like their hotels/motels...if it looks like several hours until they finally cancelled the game!!!The stadium is NOT air conditioned in certain areas like most collegiate stadiums. Never ending ramps that are hard on knees. No available elevators!Just not an IL Memorial Stadium fan.Just know going there keep an eye on the sky & don't get trapped.
2605,Date of experience: October 2015,22-Jul-16,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Great Stadium,"Have been watching Illinois FB games in Memorial Stadium forever.  Have experienced  some real highs here but, unfortunately, far too many more lows.  But whether the team is good or bad, this old stadium just keeps up with its timeless appeal.  Built when Red Grange played but still a terrific venue.  As the old saying goes, ""They don't build them like that anymore."""
2606,Date of experience: November 2015,16-Jun-16,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Great for football games and band competition,"Was there for Illinois college football game. Of course, half time is always a favorite. Decent concessions, very clean and orderly as this type of venue. Bathrooms are usually very tidy as well. We go several times a year and enjoy it. Hoping for a better football season this year. Go Illini!!"

2611,Date of experience: November 2015,17-Nov-15,Big Ten,Illinois,4,Great stadium; slow concessions,"We visited for the OSU-IL football game. We loved that there was no traffic getting to the game and parking was simple (compared to home games at OSU!).  The stadium was very nice, and we were thrilled that row 9 (section 102) was actually row 4, since they didn't use the first 5 rows in front of us. My only complaint was that the concessions were not prepared for a sell-out game. The concession workers didn't seem to have much urgency, and the delivery (of pizzas for example to the stands) was inadequate to meet demand for a noon (EST) game.  Also, there aren't any food vendors outside the stadium - we will know next time that tailgating is solution!"
2612,Date of experience: November 2015,17-Nov-15,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Dad's Weekend November 2015,Had a wonderful time!  The half-time show was awesome!  The crowd was energetic and fun!  We sat in club seating and everyone there was very friendly and helpful!
2613,Date of experience: November 2015,17-Nov-15,Big Ten,Illinois,4,Nice little stadium,"This was a great experience. The Illini fans are classy. As a visiting fan - we weren't disrespected or worried about our safety. The stadium is really nice. I wouldn't want to be underneath the upper deck though with seating, so get seats down front in the lower or upper deck. We were here around Veteran's Day and the pre-game festivities were very well done! God Bless America! There are no places to grab a beer around the stadium, so it if you aren't tailgating - better find a local watering hole before you get to the game."
2614,Date of experience: November 2015,16-Nov-15,Big Ten,Illinois,5,ILLINI,"Woo! Go Illini!!!!! Excellent stadium, and sit on the away side if you can to avoid wind. Make sure to get pretzels and hot chocolate!"
2615,Date of experience: November 2015,16-Nov-15,Big Ten,Illinois,4,Fun Football afternoon,"My wife and I visited Memorial Stadium on a November afternoon for the Ohio State - Illinois football game.  The stadium was easy to find, the traffic control was very good, and parking was easy.  We arrived about 1 1/2 hours before kickoff.  We parked very close to the stadium and the cost was no higher than other stadiums we have visited.  Entry was well organized and we found our seats easily.  The visitor sections are 109, 208, and 209.  Concessions are pretty much standard offerings for a football game.  I would not go to the concession stands at halftime as it will take you a long time to navigate the lines. They also have booths to purchase Illini souvenirs inside the stadium.  After the game, I was impressed with the traffic control getting away from the stadium."
2616,Date of experience: October 2015,27-Oct-15,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Stadium and tailgate review,"Memorial Stadium is an awesome stadium ! Wonderful seating , and football game. We came up from Tennessee to watch the Illinois / Badgers game . Tailgate experience was wonderful . Transportation from the tailgate to the stadium , was very nice . The restrooms were clean and supplied ! All in all a great experience!"
2617,Date of experience: October 2015,26-Oct-15,Big Ten,Illinois,3,Happy for a Badgers W,"I took my wife to Memorial Stadium for her birthday to watch our Badgers take on the Fighting Illini.  Having been to several stadiums in the B10, I can safely say this one is average.  Part of it may be the team being in transition, but the crowd was pretty quiet for the entire game so there wasn't much atmosphere.  The food/drinks were not great and not on par with other football/baseball venues in the Midwest. The videoboard is not viewable for each section (though that could be determined in advance if the ticket buyer would do some research...) On a positive note, the DJ inside the stadium picked some great music during the game (though it seemed like no one else was into it!).  There was tailgating lots nearby and the bars were about a mile from the stadium so there are eating/drinking options before/after the game.  The fans were courteous and the views from the stadium to the surrounding area were nice.  But there are better venues to watch some B10 action."
2618,Date of experience: October 2015,25-Oct-15,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Nice tailgating area,"We attended the Illinois - Wisconsin football game at this stadium on Saturday.  We were there from Wisconsin and had not been to this stadium before.  We were impressed with the large parking / tailgating area right outside the stadium.  They put on a lot of entertaining activities during the game, including fireworks.  Had an enjoyable time."
2619,Date of experience: October 2015,25-Oct-15,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Ninety-two years old and looking better than ever,"I remember climbing to the top row of the east balcony to see my first Illinois football game in 1958. I remember climbing to the top of the west balcony to sit in the tiny press box in 1962. I remember watching Dick Butkus and the 1963 Big Ten championship team. I remember when the Illinois High School Association conducted its first championship playoff games at Memorial Stadium in 1999. But that was a different stadium. Completed in 1923 at a cost of $1.7 million, Memorial Stadium was dedicated to University of Illinois students who died in World War I. Their names are engraved on nearly 200 pillars surrounding the facade. The stadium was officially dedicated on Oct. 18, 1924, an unforgettable occasion when the legendary Red Grange scored six touchdowns in a 39-14 homecoming victory over Michigan. Today, Grange's statue dominates the grounds on the west side of the stadium. It was part of a $100 million renovation project that completely changed the stadium as I once knew it. The stadium that once attracted a record crowd of 78,287 in 1984 now has a capacity of 62,143, thanks to a new press box and luxury boxes on three levels. Old-timers will note seating in the south horseshoe, 5,000-seat structure in the north end zone, a new artificial field surface, new 36 feet by 96 feet scoreboard, an updated sound system and two 420-foot long ribbon video boards installed along the facade. Memorial Stadium is 92 years old but it is keeping up with the times, much like the State Farm Center (formerly the Assembly Hall) across the street that is being thoroughly renovated in its 52nd year. And I remember when the Assembly Hall was just a big hole in the ground. If only Chief Illiniwek was alive to see it all."
2620,Date of experience: September 2015,29-Sep-15,Big Ten,Illinois,5,I can not be objective I love this old barn,"I will let you know up front I have had season tickets with my buddy for 40 years. A visitor for a game will find friendly fans ample parking Red Grange statue party area grange grove, and the main attraction the stadium itself a majestic old barn that all the local fans love."
2621,Date of experience: September 2015,20-Sep-15,Big Ten,Illinois,3,"Come for the game, not the stadium","I love the pageantry of college football, and the memories it brings back.  I love the atmosphere of the tailgating before  the games.  You will get those things, but keep your expectations for the stadium itself in check.  Unless you are up in corporate heaven it's bleachers.  The food service is strictly ""meh"", at best. My nachos and cheese order was a cold chips in plastic bag, and the clerk has to ask ""do you want cheese with that"" -- after a yes, a stingy cheese cup was served up, I should have asked for two, or better yet, just did without.Don't forget its a university -- have your alcohol before the game while tailgating -- that's sensible at a college stadium."
2622,Date of experience: September 2015,16-Sep-15,Big Ten,Illinois,4,A fun experience made even better with Grange Grove,"Win or lose, it is always fun to attend an Illini football game at Memorial Stadium.  However, the experience just moved up a few notches with the addition of Grange Grove--a free tailgate area.  Inflatables, music, and fun abound.  Rentals available if you want to host your own tailgate experience."
2623,Date of experience: November 2014,11-Sep-15,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Fighting Illini,What can I say but its always fun to go and watch a good college football team... unfortunately the Fighting Illini usually come up short but still a fan of them and their stadium
2624,Date of experience: September 2015,9-Sep-15,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Fantastic Stadium,"Great atmosphere for football games and there are upgrades going on all the time. There is always a lot of tailgating going on before games.  The facility itself is terrific with adequate concessions, restroom, etc.  The Illini fans are great."
2625,Date of experience: August 2015,8-Aug-15,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Saturdays and Memorial Stadium were made for Football,I love to drive by the stadium even when there isn't a game.  If there isn't a game or if there is the one thing missing is Chief Illiniwek --- a pox upon those that ousted that honorable symbol of Illinois.
2626,Date of experience: November 2014,23-Jul-15,Big Ten,Illinois,4,Great Stadium,"We went here last fall to watch the Illini Football team win. Nice updated stadium with plenty of concessions, restrooms, and water fountains."
2627,Date of experience: October 2014,23-Jul-15,Big Ten,Illinois,4,Great Tailgates,Fun tailgating! We tailgated for a while outside. The security was a lot nicer than I have seen in other college/university games/ tailgates. Stadium is fun!
2628,Date of experience: September 2014,7-May-15,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Renovated and updated but still remarkably original,A great day to see a football game?  Go early and walk the stadium.  Enjoy the memorial pillars that not too many people notice.  The techno parts of the stadium are updated now too.
2630,Date of experience: October 2014,18-Mar-15,Big Ten,Illinois,4,Fun atmosphere,We enjoy learning about new traditions at various college events. The Illini proudly share their blue and orange -- even when they don't have a lot to cheer about.
2631,Date of experience: October 2014,28-Feb-15,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Great Memories of Memorial Stadium,"Memorial Stadium is a great place to attend football games,live music events & Fourth of July fireworks.It's a beautiful building,smack dab in the middle of the U of I campus.Renovated several years ago,it is much more ""user"" friendly.  Better bathrooms & handicap facilities,plus a staff that seems proud to work there. Plenty of concessions to eat,mostly what you would expect. Hot dogs,brats.nachos,popcorn,chips etc.  Parking can be a problem,so be prepared to walk.  It's a beautiful building,steeped in tradition & I'm so glad they fixed it up,rather than tore it down to make a new ""sterile"" stadium. A real jewel in Champaign-Urbana!"
2632,Date of experience: November 2014,15-Nov-14,Big Ten,Illinois,4,West side renovations make it nice,Great visit to watch a not so great team. Heated bathrooms help a lot during cold games. Had a spill at the concession stand and workers were very helpful and not near as upset as I would have been if someone spilled that much soda near me. Would love to see more of a variety of concessions for people with dietary issues/needs
2633,Date of experience: October 2014,26-Oct-14,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Great Facility,A better football team would help the overall experience.    The Marching Illini are worth the visit even though the Chief is sadly no longer with us.
2634,Date of experience: September 2014,10-Sep-14,Big Ten,Illinois,4,"Nice Stadium, Great Experience!","I should first say that I am not a connoisseur of stadiums.  That being said, I had a great experience at Memorial Stadium.  One of my family is in a wheelchair and we sat in the 'disabled' seating area.  When we first arrived and asked where our seats were located we were pleasantly surprised that the staff person, instead of merely pointing the way, actually walked us all the way to our section (quite a long walk).The stadium appeared clean and well cared for.  As stadium food goes, Memorial's was good.  Everyone there had a good time and I saw no evidence of poor sportsmanship among the fans--even though I and some of my family were rooting for the visiting team.I almost forgot...there is shuttle service from the parking garage to the game ($2.00 per person round-trip).All-in-all a very positive experience.  I would love to return for another game!"
2635,Date of experience: September 2014,9-Sep-14,Big Ten,Illinois,4,We are alumni so we enjoy the football games.,Easy to tailgate within close proximity. We enjoyed our trip. It can get very hot in the sun so be prepared.
2636,Date of experience: September 2014,6-Sep-14,Big Ten,Illinois,5,"Strong Tradition, Great looking traditional stadium","The columns on the West and East sides are awe-inspiring and gives it a traditional historic look. The stadium underwent a massive remodel that retained its classic look but added suites and colonnade seats on the West side. The colonnades ($200-300 per ticket) have an excellent view and you can go inside if it gets too cold.The traditional main seating ($39-$60) gives you a close-up feel of the game. The Marching band has a long history back to John Philip Souza.Stadium Capacity: 60,670Constructed: 1923Suites and Club added: 2008-2010"
2637,Date of experience: August 2014,6-Sep-14,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Awesome,It is a must visit - the size and scale are breathtaking ! It was built in the 1920's as a memorial to Illinois men and women who gave their lives for their country during World War I. Their names appear on columns that support the sides of the stadium.
2638,Date of experience: October 2013,2-Sep-14,Big Ten,Illinois,5,love big time football,nice stadium. just how a D1 school is supposed to be. the large crowds and tailgating. cannot go wrong with this.
2639,Date of experience: November 2013,31-Jul-14,Big Ten,Illinois,5,This is where Grange and Butkus played,"I'll never forget the first time I visited Memorial Stadium in Champaign. I was a freshman in 1958 and I purchased a season ticket to attend all the home football games. I deliberately requested a seat in the top row of the bleachers in the upper balcony on the East Side. For the home opener, I was one of the first people to be seated for the game, almost two hours before kickoff. I had seen the Illinois marching band on television and my objective was to discover how Chief Illiniwek was able to weave between the band and run onto the field without hardly being detected. And, of course, sitting in the top row, I had a bird's-eye view of the game. Illinois' team wasn't very good during my four years as an undergraduate. But I was well aware of the history and the tradition. After graduating, I covered the team for four years, including the   Dick Butkus era, for the Champaign-Urbana Courier. While working at the St. Louis Globe-Democrat in 1966-68, I broke the story that Jim Valek was going to be Illinois' new football coach. Memorial Stadium may not receive the national publicity reserved for The Big House at Michigan or the Horseshoe at Ohio State. But they don't enjoy Memorial Stadium's rich history. Built in 1923, the beautiful colonnades on both sides of the stadium are dedicated to the 183 students and alumni who died during World War I. This is where Bob Zuppke, one of college football's legendary coaches, practiced his trade. This is where arguably the greatest college football player in history, Red Grange, gained immortality by scoring six touchdowns (four in the first 12 minutes) to beat Michigan 39-14 in the inaugural game. Grange's statue can be viewed on the West Side of the stadium. Perhaps Butkus' statue will join him one day. The stadium has changed considerably since I was a student and sportswriter. The green wooden shack at the top of the west balcony that passed for a press box is long gone, replaced by a modern facility and luxury boxes. I recall how thrilled high school players were when the Illinois High School Association moved the championship games of its postseason playoff from Illinois State to Memorial Stadium. To them, it was like moving to Yankee Stadium. Of course, there was something missing when I sat on the top row in 1958. Today, folks in the upper balconies can look to the south and see the marvelous State Farm Center (formerly Assembly Hall), which was built in 1963 and remains one of the engineering landmarks of the 20th Century. Among the most notable people buried at Mount Hope Cemetery, which is just across the street on the East Side of the stadium are Illini sports icons Bob Zuppke, a member of the College Football Hall of Fame who recruited Grange to Illinois and produced four national championship teams, and former coaches and athletic directors George Huff and Doug Mills."
2643,Date of experience: November 2013,25-Nov-13,Big Ten,Illinois,5,The Galloping Ghost,a trip to Memorial Stadium on the University of Illinois campus is awesome!Right out front (west side) is an amazing statue of Red Grange - The Galluping Ghost who was a star football player at the U of I.the recently remodeled suites are a great place to view the game in inclimate weather otherwise the place to be is in the stands with the fans!
2644,Date of experience: November 2013,23-Nov-13,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Great stadium,"We went to the Illinois vs Ohio State game on 11/16/13.  This was our first trip to Memorial Stadium, and I came away quite impressed.  I've been to many stadiums and this one was one of the nicest for college football.  Our seats were in section 129, row 32 and gave us a great view of the game.  I don't believe there are really any bad seats in the place, unlike many of the stadiums I've been to.  The stadium staff was very friendly.  The restrooms were nice and clean.  The food was good, but overpriced (thats expected though).  Ticket prices were quite reasonable, much less than it costs to go to some of the other college football games I've attended. Parking and traffic was a breeze too.  It was a great game day atmosphere inside and outside the stadium.  We will definately go back next time the Buckeyes are in town."
2645,Date of experience: November 2013,23-Nov-13,Big Ten,Illinois,3,Nice small stadium...,"holds around 60,000. Nice facility. But windy. Parking within easy walking distance. Fans polite to visiting team."
2646,Date of experience: October 2013,3-Nov-13,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Been to almost all B1G venues and we enjoyed Memorial Stadium,"We were here at the end of October and had excellent seats at the goal line, but high enough up so we had a great view of the entire field. There is a strong history here, and it has a very friendly and accessible feel to all areas. The sound system is very good. It was a very enjoyable day. Illinois has a beautiful campus."
2647,Date of experience: September 2013,30-Sep-13,Big Ten,Illinois,4,Great Stadium!,We attended a U of I game at Memorial Stadium on Saturday 9/28 at 11am.  Our seats were section 129 row 7.  These were great seats close to the field but high enough to have a great view.  The dance team performs near section 129 for the first half of the game and the cheerleaders are there for the 2nd half of the game.  We could also see the student section which is always a great sight.  We were in full sun for the entire game.  The only seats that were in the shade for an 11am game are in the east end zone towards the top.  The bathrooms were clean and the concession area was running smoothly.  I would definitely choose these seats again for our next football game.
2648,Date of experience: October 2012,21-Jun-13,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Tradition.  Chief.  Orange and blue,"The stadium is rich in history and tradition.  We have sat in many areas from box seats on 50 yard line to horseshoe to top of the stands by end zone.....fun to be had wherever you are.  All views have pluses and minuses, all result in fun.  Get chills as the band performs the Three-in-one.  Attending a Game at Memorial Stadium is a must for any university student before graduation.  and to return as an alum brings so many fun and powerful memories.  oskee wow wow Illinois."
2649,Date of experience: November 2012,29-Apr-13,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Love Memorial Stadium,"I have seats in Premium Seating, Colonnades Section, and on the East Side of the stadium on the 40 yard line 30 rows up.  Colonnades is wonderful--when its cold or raining you can go inside and stay dry and warm while watching the game and having a warm drink (or an alcoholic beverage) to warm yourself up.  When its hot, first few games of the year, you can enjoy the game from the inside in the air conditioned seating area while having a fabulous dessert from the specialty bar.  For those perfect fall days that are just made for football you can sit outside and enjoy the perfection of a fall afternoon and the Fighting Illini.  They have a breakfast buffet for early games and a general buffet for later games as well as expanded concession stand fare that you can't get on the East side of the stadium.  Top of the line restrooms that are spotless with a special room for nursing mothers.  The East side--there's nothing like an October afternoon at Memorial Stadium on the East side, its what college football is all about.  However, don't expect and abundance of restrooms or clean ones.  A large number of concession stands with the average offerings."
2650,Date of experience: November 2012,30-Jan-13,Big Ten,Illinois,5,fun,crowd was pumped and older structure is beautiful. I've gone to Illinois football games since i was a little kid and i'm never upset when i go. it's a beautiful stadium
2652,Date of experience: September 2012,17-Jan-13,Big Ten,Illinois,4,Now all they need is a team...,"Easy to get tickets. Parking a bit of a hassle but not by big ten standards. come in curtis exit off 57 go to first street, head north and park on south side. teams not playing good, but you can get into a big ten game pretty easy."
2653,Date of experience: September 2012,9-Dec-12,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Historic football stadium,"We attended many game watching the Fighting Illini over the years.  Fun, great views and some years great football."

2655,Date of experience: September 2012,24-Sep-12,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Best stadium in the B1G,"The most beautiful and historic stadium in the B1G. With over 200 limestone columns dedicated to every Illini who died in WWI it is overflowing with Americana.  Not a bad seat in the house. Just watch out, the Illinois Football team is not the greatest. :)"
2657,Date of experience: August 2012,22-Aug-12,Big Ten,Illinois,5,"Hail to the Orange, Hail to the Blue!","We come here every year for a football game with family and dear friends, and have been doing so since 1997 as most of us are alums.....there is (in my opinion) no better place to tailgate and see a game! There is not a bad seat in the Stadium, and tickets are more reasonably priced this season! The renovation from a few years ago was awesome and the Stadium looks great and is in excellent repair! Hopefully the team will have a great year and go to another bowl game. The East side of the Stadium is where we usually sit, but we have sat in lots of places! The tradition just cannot be beat, and the new student section in the North end zone rocks throughout the entire game! We have a blast tailgating before and after, there are not any specific RV lots anymore, though the lot catty corner from the Stadium on First Street is very RV friendly, this is where we go every year. Try Papa Del's for dinner on Second and Green, best pizza anywhere! GO ILLINI!!!!"
2659,Date of experience: October 2011,27-Jun-12,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Cold weather warning.,"If you are going to a football game on a cold day, try to sit on the east side.  The seats on the west side will be in the shade and can get pretty cold.  A great place to watch the Fighting Illini kick some butt!"
2663,Date of experience: October 2011,27-Jan-12,Big Ten,Illinois,5,Great old stadium,Recently remodeled but still keeping with the history of the stadium. The field is just awesome and usually a great crowd especially on a cold Saturday night.

2666,Date of experience: November 2011,13-Nov-11,Big Ten,Illinois,4,Game day,"Parking is bad, park across Neil and do not pay in the lots. They put you incredibly far Away. Stadium access is good. Very simple stadium"
2667,Date of experience: September 2011,20-Sep-11,Big Ten,Illinois,4,Great football and Excellent Band!!!!!,"We won great tickets thanks to Scheel's Sporting Goods to go to our first footgame at the University of Illnois and Memorial Stadium. How exciting to share this time with my six year old grandson as well. It was such a nice day and the crowd definitely had the spirit! Thank you to all the cheerleading squads! A great winning game with fireworks at each touchdown. The band....what can we say? Right along with this excellent football team was the most entertaining and impeccable band that I've seen since high school! AND that says a lot. I'm not sure what all my grandson was most taken with; the excitement of the game, the fireworks, the pretty cheerleaders or the music of the band! A great day to be had and I would recommend a visit to the stadium any day. A side note: there was just too much 'clutter' of people on the sidelines. We had very good seats BUT we would sit higher up if we were to go back. Thank you to the sports and band director as well as the administration!"
2670,Date of experience: October 2021,16-Oct-21,Big Ten,Iowa,3,Historic,The stadium is a historic football venue. The atmosphere during a game is awesome. The Iowa staff does a great job with all aspects of the game. I gave it a 3 based in the parking situation.  I had to walk over 1 mile to the stadium
2671,Date of experience: October 2021,11-Oct-21,Big Ten,Iowa,1,Verbally abusive fans and lack of security ruined the game,Beautiful small stadium ruined by the actions of the Hawkeye fans.  The meanest fans I have ever encountered in any sport.  Be careful walking alone around the stadium if you are a woman from an opposing team.  I had a middle aged man approach me booing and screaming at me as I walked to the bathroom.  The behavior was ridiculous and scary. Police officers should be stationed in the visitors section.  There were none and the Iowa fans took full advantage.  Not only do the Hawkeyes heckle the fans but they taunt and boo injured players.  Other scary facts are the stadium did not wand those who entered and they served beer almost the entire game.  We will never be back.  I recommend that any one considering going to an away game at Kinnick stay home.
2673,Date of experience: October 2019,5-Mar-20,Big Ten,Iowa,5,"""Kinnick Stadium"" was Iowa Stadium until 1972","First thing to know, it is only known as ""Kinnick Stadium."" The stadium was named after the only Heisman trophy winner from the University of Iowa.  Kinnick died in a training accident in 1943 flying his plane from the aircraft carrier USS Lexington (CV-16), which was off the coast of Venezuela in the Gulf of Paria. Also the first Heisman trophy winner ever to die. Second thing to know, that picture is from a wrestling match where UIOWA set the attendance record for a wrestling team dual at 42,287 in 2015."

2675,Date of experience: November 2019,5-Feb-20,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Fun in Iowa City,We went to IC for the Minnesota game.  Park near Finkbine! I like the stadium a lot.  The sight lines are good on the press box side of the stadium.  The fans are friendly.  The security is there but not overwhelming.
2676,Date of experience: November 2019,11-Dec-19,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Exciting venue,"Hawkeye fans should definitely attend a game at Kinnick Stadium sometime in their lifetime. Night games are especially exciting. I like the north end zone. The view of the field and developing plays is good. The new concessions and restrooms are very nice here. If you like the Hawks, plan your visit."
2677,Date of experience: September 2019,23-Nov-19,Big Ten,Iowa,2,"Nice campus, but disappointing stadium experience","This isn't a bad stadium, but it wasn't enjoyable as it should have been. The fans were rude to those wearing opposing gear. I have traveled to many away games for different universities, but this was the worst. It took about 25 minutes to funnel into our section after we entered the stadium. I have no idea why it took so long, but that was surprising. The train to take to the stadium was not that quick at all. Yeah, the train ride is a short ride, but the 45 minute wait doesn't really make avoiding traffic all that useful."
2678,Date of experience: October 2019,5-Nov-19,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Hawkeye Football.,What an incredible environment. The people are the greatest. We were able to get seats in the new club seating section in the south end zone. It was very well done. Well appointment. We had a fantastic time overall.
2679,Date of experience: October 2019,20-Oct-19,Big Ten,Iowa,4,Visiting team friendly,"My son and I visited Kinnick as Penn State fans. This was our first away game and did not know what to expect when being outnumbered. Simply put.. we had a great time!! Iowa fans were so nice and accommodating and we sat among some fun fans! The stadium itself was cool and the stripeout was awesome! Nothing beats the greatest tradition in college football though when the fans wave to the patients at the Children??s Hospital at the end of the first quarter. We enjoyed the atmosphere, band and fans. A great place to see a game!"
2680,Date of experience: October 2019,18-Oct-19,Big Ten,Iowa,5,SIMPLY THE BEST!,"Kinnick Stadium in Iowas City is SO FUN!  So filled with great traditions, great tailgating, marching band, fly over, fireworks (the night we were there), and wonderful people!  If you have never gone to an Iowa game..GO!  And tailgate too, it's AWESOME!"
2681,Date of experience: October 2019,14-Oct-19,Big Ten,Iowa,4,Saturday Night Life!,"I am a Penn State grad used to the student section energy and alumni exuberance of ??cozi?? Beaver Stadium. But Kinnick has its own unique charm?? a 90 year old gem, steps from the merriment of the tailgating community. Within the brick facade on game night, win or lose, the Hawkeyes do a great job of celebrating and promoting Midwest traditions and values. A F-35 flyover, the 1st quarter children??s hospital wave, and a bright, nearly full silvery moon added to the enjoyment of the nighttime experience. (And the bathrooms are heated!)"
2682,Date of experience: October 2019,13-Oct-19,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Midwestern Hospitality,This was our first Big 10 visit to an opponent??s stadium.  They set the bar high. EVERYONE was friendly and welcomed us. From tailgating the entry to the stadium to the fans around us.  We enjoyed the wave and the electricity of a night game. Great old stadium with modern conveniences.
2683,Date of experience: October 2018,9-Jul-19,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Unreal Energy,"The energy that happens in this stadium on Football Saturdays is amazing. Seating is great, and the 1st quarter wave to the children's hospital is unforgettable."
2685,Date of experience: October 2018,7-May-19,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Great game day experience!,"Spectacular stadium for watching excellent Iowa football! After the first quarter, everyone in the crowd turns toward the Children??s Hospital and waves to the children and families who are watching the game from the top floor. Great venue for Big Ten football, wonderful crowd, fabulous band, exceptional experience. The best!"
2686,Date of experience: November 2018,24-Nov-18,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Fantastic Experience,"I attended my first college football game at Kinnick Stadium for the Nebraska vs. Iowa game. We weren't really sure where to park as we got closer to the stadium. A really nice parking lot attendant in a ""parking pass only"" section was incredibly helpful and showed us a great place to park. Even though it was the end of November, it was a nice day and the walk from the lot to the stadium was just fine. The attendants in the lot gave us trash bags in case we needed them for tailgating. We met a ton of fun tailgaters even though I was in my Nebraska Cornhuskers gear. Everyone was super friendly and I was offered more beer than I could drink in a sort amount of time. Every staff member and police officer we encountered at the stadium was friendly and happy to direct us toward our seats and answer any questions we had. We had seats in the Kinnick Edge Club. We had plenty of seat and leg room and didn't have struggles with people needing space as they walked back and forth in front of us.This area is under construction. The only downfall of that was that the restrooms were porta potties. It was drizzling by the 3rd quarter which made the porta potty area a muddy mess. That's just one of those things a person has to deal with with construction. We had a great time no matter what and kept commenting on how nice everyone was, particularly to opposing team fans. I enjoyed waving to the kids in the adjacent hospital. I'd seen that on TV and read about it many times. It was moving to be a part of it in person. One things we noted was the massive amount of trash left by the tailgaters in the lot closest to the stadium. I saw hundreds of beer cans just tossed in the grassy area between the lot and sidewalk in multiple areas. Most of the tailgaters we saw there on our way to the game didn't seem to be college student age, so seeing all the garbage was somewhat of a surprise. We have NFL season tickets and trash simply tossed on the ground is just not something that happens. I found it odd. With the 5 cent deposit thing in Iowa, someone could've made a small fortune picking up cans."
2687,Date of experience: September 2018,24-Sep-18,Big Ten,Iowa,3,night game,"A night game to see my Badgers in Iowa cityPros, the presentation of the team coming out of the tunnel was great, it is by far the loudest stadium I ever been in, the sections were filled with yellow and black dressed fans to make a stripe pattern, waving to the kids in the hospital. The rows-leg room- and seats -width- are far larger than most college stadiums.Cons, well why is it that Iowa fans seem to need to stand the entire game? The stadium stereo system has lots of distortion, why do they allow people to drink on the streets, and then carry beer into the place, far too many drunk Iowa fans, why is screaming I-O-W-A 300 times a good thing? Why must they play the exact same song every time its third down?Then there is the one tunnel per section, so it takes forever to get to the rest rooms, since its clogged with people? Don't they  have a fire marshall in Iowa City?And they only sell Dasani water in the concession stand, complete with its normal after taste."
2688,Date of experience: September 2018,15-Sep-18,Big Ten,Iowa,3,Overrated,On a business trip I recently visited Memorial Stadium in Champaign and was much more impressed with the architecture and non-add ons than Kinnick has.  You have to see this place
2689,Date of experience: September 2018,10-Sep-18,Big Ten,Iowa,5,IOWA FOOTBALL THE BEST EVER,I went to the IOWA - IOWA STATE GAME ON 9/8/2018 and it was the best atmosphere that you could imagine being in.
2690,Date of experience: September 2018,8-Sep-18,Big Ten,Iowa,2,No Service with Verizon,"Lots of issues at Kinnick.  Parking and traffic are terrible but expected.  Minimal to no service for Verizon which is a huge issue if using digital tickets.  Would definitely recommend printing tickets at home instead of relying on mobile tickets.  Long lines for bathrooms and concessions.  Very tight bench seating.  Difficult to enjoy game with Iowa Superfan who refuses to sit for any portion of the game as he is ??cheering?? for the defense, despite entire section around him sitting down.  Game day experience would be better if security turned away those that are clearly intoxicated."
2691,Date of experience: September 2018,7-Sep-18,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Best Game Day Atmosphere,"Got there early to tailgate. Welcomed by the other tailgaters around us. Stuck up friendly conversation with many of them.Concourse is a little 'tight' with that many people, but who cares? You're at an Iowa game!Great upgrades to the stadium over the years!"
2692,Date of experience: September 2018,4-Sep-18,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Great place to catch a Hawkeye game!,"My dad and I recently traveled to Iowa City from Michigan to check out a game at Kinnick Stadium to check off our bucket list of watching a game at every Big Ten stadium. We had heard great things about the stadium and were excited to finally have a chance to check it out.There are multiple free parking lots to park at and take a shuttle to the game which was a great feature for us as we hadn't been to a stadium before that had free parking and shuttle so that was a pleasant surprise!The atmosphere is great, with a lot of die hard fans and rich tradition. The student section is not as alive as some other stadiums we have been to, but were still entertaining.There are a lot of food options available to satisfy any appetite and were decently priced. There were a lot of other amenities available as well for fans to enjoy which was also nice.It does get pretty crowded at halftime/etc., as the hallways are a little small, so make sure you go before quarters are over otherwise you'll be waiting a while!Overall, it was a pleasant experience for out-of-towners like us and created some great memories. Would highly recommend giving it a chance, especially if you are local, just to enjoy a stadium with so much history!"
2693,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Sep-18,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Ballboy duties for NIU,"Although our outcome wasn??t great, the stadium and atmosphere around it was. They??re currently in the middle of a $90mil addition on the north end but the construction wasn??t a distraction. Great views from every angle - not one of the largest Big Ten stadiums but just as loud. Paid $20 for parking behind a restaurant and had a 10min walk. Took a little while to get back on I-80 due to road construction in town. Overall, glad I made the trip to Iowa City."
2694,Date of experience: September 2018,1-Sep-18,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Awesome Stadium Experience!,"Came last year for a game and came again this year. This stadium may not have the same amenities as newer stadiums, but it has wonderful charm and is truly a great place for college football. I'm amazed every time I see it in person and recommend a visit for any college football fan and especially Iowa Hawkeye fans!"
2695,Date of experience: November 2017,21-Aug-18,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Best Place to Watch a Big 10 Football Game,"I have seen several games at Kinnick Stadium and it is truly one of the greatest venues in all of college football. The fans are great, the game is easy to see from all angles and you can feel the excitement in every game played there. Iowa fans are great fans, hospitable and they know how to treat people. The concessions are great, the programs are cool and the tailgating is fun. It's an experience that everyone must have at least once."
2697,Date of experience: September 2017,19-Jun-18,Big Ten,Iowa,1,Unfriendly for Hawkeye Fans trying to enjoy the game while alcohol continues to flow!,"Too many ""drunk fans"" are still making the experience a negative atmosphere and the sell outs, falling in numbers,prove it.Great for those up in the fancy expensive seats, but zero tolerance on alcohol is a joke!  Too bad Season ticket sales continue  to dwindle, resulting in ""packages of games"" being offered to recoup some of dollars! The TEAM does its best to offer a worthwhile game experience. Too bad the fans in the stands have to put up with the obvious weakness in enforcement of the behavior policy.  Too many have walked away from the ticket opportunity and they won't be back.  That's Me as well!"
2698,Date of experience: October 2017,18-Jun-18,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Fantastic venue for Big Ten football,"Great Game Day experience. One of the loudest college football stadiums I have been in. The band is one of the Big Ten's best. The fans are right on top of the sidelines. Best seats are about row 20 or so and higher, whether you are on the sideline or in the end zone seats. If you love college football, especially Big Ten style, you need to experience Kinnick Stadium, home of The Wave!"
2699,Date of experience: October 2017,22-Dec-17,Big Ten,Iowa,5,My 2nd Home,"Kinnick Stadium is THE iconic place in Iowa City.  I've lived all my 62 years and, from the age of 12, Kinnick has been like sitting into you favorite old stuffed recliner chair.  The smells from the popcorn and peanuts are old friends.  Used to help people to their seats when I was in Boy Scouts and got to stay and watch the game(in the 60's).  Later as a student, then alumni, had the immense pride of watching Hayden Fry bring dignity and pride back to Hawkeye football.  Now we have the ""Wave"" which epitomizes what the U of I, and Iowa City, is all about.  If you have a problem with Iowa City, you probably hate Christmas."
2700,Date of experience: November 2017,29-Nov-17,Big Ten,Iowa,5,This is Hawkeye Heaven,"Always arrive early, and stay for the whole experience. This is a bucket list item for any Hawkeye. The band is always tremendous, so do not miss the halftime show. The Nile Kinnick introduction on the Jumbotron is worth the wait. GO HAWKS!!!!!!!!!!!"
2701,Date of experience: November 2017,10-Nov-17,Big Ten,Iowa,4,Worth a trip at least once,"I've been going to games since 1969 (8 years old.)  The changes that have been made to Kinnick in the last 25 years have been for the most part good.  More TV screens for replays (when they choose to show them, controversial plays are often not shown), bigger scoreboard, permanent lighting, prescription field turf that still looks green in November & the offer for season ticket holders to purchase cushioned seatbacks.  So about the seats...Unless you are in the premium seats in press box suites, it's bench seating throughout the stadium, which is fine except for those who can't fit themselves into their limited allotted space.  So having the seatbacks helps define your personal space, I highly recommend finding that kind of seat for sale if possible.  If you can't, then bring a blanket to soften your seat & be prepared to 'squeeze in'.Otherwise, the stadium was built in 1929 with no track circling the field, so the stands are practically on top of the sidelines.  Opponents claim it's one of the most difficult places to play because the fans are so close to the field.  When the Hawkeyes are playing well, the place can be electric."
2702,Date of experience: November 2017,5-Nov-17,Big Ten,Iowa,2,Overrated,I thought it was great that they wave to the kids at the hospital... and great to give money to  the hospital but knowing how much other schools support charities  it seemed  like a super  low  ball figure especially  considering it  is such a packed stadium. Our seats were up close but the people around were rude and immature.  There should be mutual respect for each team playing not booing and name calling during the opposing teams cheering. Disappointed in the quality of people. It's busy and extremely important to arrive early so you're not the person interrupting the game for people after it has started as several locals we're doing... Stepping on our feet... Just not impressed.
2703,Date of experience: October 2017,10-Oct-17,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Awesome Stadium,This stadium is always super clean and the staff is always friendly! The overall experience at the stadium is always a pleasurable one. If you have a chance to attend a game here I would highly recommend it!!!
2704,Date of experience: September 2017,6-Sep-17,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Magnificent seating.,"We have seats for the last 27 years in the north end zone on the left hash mark, aisle seats and have been sitting with the same friends in front of us all that time.  Awesome experience"
2705,Date of experience: September 2017,2-Sep-17,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Amazing Stadium!,One of the better stadiums in college football.  The architecture is wonderful and it's easy to get in and out of the stadium.  It also helps that the Iowa Hawkeyes put on a good team year after year!
2706,Date of experience: October 2016,8-Aug-17,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Iowa's Three Bears Stadium: Not too big....not too small....just right,Set between the University Hospital complex and a quaint neighborhood wlth charm. Kinnick is a diminutive Camp Randall and a grown-up's Ryan Field. But better than either .Our Daughter and  Son-in-law  had their wedding reception there in 2015.
2707,Date of experience: November 2016,16-Jul-17,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Season Ticket Holder,We've had football season tickets for the past few years and enjoy attending games at Kinnick Stadium.  There is plenty of staff present for assistance.  The restrooms are well maintained and can accommodate many.  Food and beverage selections are many.  Traffic control (both vehicle and pedestrian) is usually done well.
2708,Date of experience: September 2016,10-Jul-17,Big Ten,Iowa,4,Great Saturday in the Fall,Kinnick Stadium is easy to get to and has very good sight lines to view the game.It's set in a quaint neighborhood with pretty good parking options.
2709,Date of experience: September 2016,13-Mar-17,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Our Hometown great Football stadium and much more,"We have attended football games in this historical stadium for almost half a century now.So my bias in clear! It also offers chairs with backs in the outdoor seating for comfort as well as more high end enclosures. It is close to University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics and many parking options. Lots of fun and fun sandwiches,drinks, await you there.It is smoke free and alcohol free. Go Hawks!"
2710,Date of experience: November 2016,27-Jan-17,Big Ten,Iowa,3,Stay in Your Seat and You Will Be Fine,"We had a very good game day experience overall. We arrived at the tailgating lot early, which is highly recommended because traffic eventually became almost unmanageable. I like that they give you a thick trash bag as you enter. The parking lot supervisor directed us to a prime spot to set up our canopy, grill, and table. He also made sure that we had space for the rest of the cars in our group to park nearby, holding them as the parking lot filled in. This was most appreciated. In fact, every staff member we encountered was friendly and welcoming. The walk to the stadium wasn't bad. We scanned right in and found our seats. The concourse is a little on the narrow side, especially once the game starts. Concession lines were long but since we loaded up early at our seats it didn't matter to us. We were in the closed end zone, which is physically separated from the rest of the stadium. This made visiting friends in other areas a chore, having to walk all the way up to the concourse, then back down again. I was also disappointed by the lack of stats on the few video boards they had. It seemed that they were there for advertising and keeping up with statistics became a chore. If they had Wi-Fi it was pretty much non-existent in our section. Either put up all the stats or enable people to access the information online. After the game we decided the best course of action was to break out the grill and fire it up, because the traffic out was a mess. It was a couple of hours before we saw a lightening of the long line of taillights and felt it would be OK to leave."
2711,Date of experience: September 2016,25-Jan-17,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Awesome place,"Visited a game in a packed stadium. Incredible atmosphere watching a game with 70,000 of your closest friends during the game. Awesome tailgate all around!!"
2712,Date of experience: November 2016,29-Nov-16,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Awesome stadium!,The atmosphere of this stadium was great - fans were so nice and there wasn't a bad seat in the stadium. There was a ton of tailgating outside the stadium which was a lot of fun and we also took a lap around inside the stadium to see it all - overall great experience!
2713,Date of experience: November 2016,25-Nov-16,Big Ten,Iowa,2,"Great stadium, lousy concourses","Nice place to watch a game but concourses are crowded and concession line is worse than other Big Ten venues.  Left the game with 3 minutes left in the half and barely made it to my seat before 2nd half.  Staffing at concession could easily have doubled.  Inside, video replays were sporadic but otherwise everything was ok."
2714,Date of experience: November 2016,17-Nov-16,Big Ten,Iowa,4,"Good stadium, stay away from the big scoreboard","The stadium was nice. We were there as the visitors. The seats we got were under the big scoreboard. The music was terribly loud. So loud that the seats were vibrating. If you go, stay clear of sections 215, 216 and 217 in the south end zone. Especially up high. It made the experience pretty miserable."
2715,Date of experience: November 2016,13-Nov-16,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Great stadium,"Great signeage and tons of washrooms!  Lots of food and vendors in the stands too.  Jumbotron makes the game even better, very clean facility."
2716,Date of experience: October 2016,23-Oct-16,Big Ten,Iowa,3,Good overall experience!,"A fun stadium to watch a game in, for sure. As a visiting fan, the people there were very friendly. One issue though, were that the aisles were so narrow that it made for a daunting task to get in/out of your row, so bringing food and drinks back was especially difficult. We were in the north end zone, so I'm not sure if the whole stadium is like that or not. Overall it was a positive experience though."
2717,Date of experience: October 2016,1-Oct-16,Big Ten,Iowa,4,Go hawks!,"Friendly Iowa crowd in aging stadium with some amenity skyboxes. Seats, facilities, and food predictable. Some Skybox levels permit alcohol consumption. Cute Hawkeye Express Train transports fans  from remote parking."
2718,Date of experience: September 2016,20-Sep-16,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Nice,What a sweet stadium. The Hawks lost but we still had a great time. I really wished they served beer though. Lines for the restrooms went fast. Can't wait for my next visit
2719,Date of experience: September 2016,20-Sep-16,Big Ten,Iowa,4,"Football game, Go Bison!",The game we attended was packed and we were packed in our stadium seats. Temp was 80 degrees. HOT!. I left at half time and went in the concession area only to find no benches or any form of seating. I think some sort of seating could be installed against the metal fencing. Very well staffed. All were friendly after game even though Hawks lost.
2720,Date of experience: September 2016,18-Sep-16,Big Ten,Iowa,4,Not a Hawkeye fan but....,"my granddaughters are.  I get to take them to games, which I love very much!Kinnick Stadium is a historic football venue in Iowa City, IA.  It is old but that doesn't mean that it isn't comfortable.  The restrooms are updated and nice.  The refreshment stands are numerous and located throughout the stadium.  Spectator seats are aluminum bleacher type seats and are not all that comfortable in cold or inclement weather.  (Take something to sit on and that will help.) my seat on Saturday had a seat pad and back support that was very nice.  That is not the norm however so don't plan on that. Seat spaces (denoted by numbers on the bleachers) are close together so it can be ""tight"" seating during cold days when everyone is bundled-up.I do like going to Kinnick for football games. It is historic and yet comfortable due to upgrades made through the years."
2721,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,Big Ten,Iowa,3,Good facilities and restaurants.,This is a nice recently renovated stadium. Good food options and bathroom options. It is very clean. It is smaller by Big Ten standards but very nice friendly fans.
2722,Date of experience: September 2016,7-Sep-16,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Iowa Football,This college stadium has such a wholesome feel. People are friendly both outside tailgating and inside the stadium. The marching band performs outside before the game to get the crowd excited.No purses allowed bigger than an iPhone
2723,Date of experience: October 2015,7-Sep-16,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Nothing Like Those Hawkeyes,"This a great venue.  Built on the campus many moons ago, it remains with many in the same location.  There is much history here, as well as some great football recently.  The only marginal seats are the sides; the far ends of the sidelines requires watching with tilted head.  I prefer the straight ahead look."
2725,Date of experience: September 2015,27-Aug-16,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Go Hawks!,"Any true Iowa fan loves Kinnick stadium. Good crowd. Best seats are in the endzones- more room to move around. I wish they sold beer but oh well. Crowd always under control. Fans are great, good chants, cool traditions. Make sure you're there before game start so you can see their back in black enterance. And lookup rules for bags- they are pretty strict. Sometimes you're allowed to bring closed water bottles in too."
2726,Date of experience: October 2015,24-Aug-16,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Greatest show on earth!,If you want to see the best football college team in IOWA come to Kinnick Stadium.Atmosphere is the best in the state!
2728,Date of experience: December 2015,23-Jul-16,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Great college football atmosphere!,Love to see the Hawkeyes play in their home stadium. Night games are amazing with a full house rocking!
2729,Date of experience: September 2015,15-Jul-16,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Go Hawks!,"this stadium is home to the Iowa Hawkeyes football team. Recent facelift- kids activities in the front of the stadium (the Krause family plaza) before football games- lots of vendors, food trucks for tailgating before the game.  Parking limited, nearby neighborhoods often have parking for a fee- or park downtown Iowa City and walk over the Iowa River bridge to the stadium. The University Hospital complex is right across the street- if you are going to the game, be aware that you will not be able to enter hospital without checking in at the main entrance & stating your business - game visitors will find plenty of food, beverages and restroom facilities without going in the hospital."
2730,Date of experience: October 2015,15-Mar-16,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Historic college stadium,"Nothing beats Kinnick on a Fall Saturday afternoon! Rabid fans, great football, exciting atmosphere in a 1929 throwback stadium with bench seating (unless you pay big donor bucks to sit in the plush press box overlooking the field). Go Hawks!"
2731,Date of experience: October 2015,6-Mar-16,Big Ten,Iowa,5,GameDay in blizzard,"The atmosphere here was like no other, even for having a blizzard the precious night. Great job to the workers that took care of the field! Beautiful inside and out!"
2732,Date of experience: November 2015,8-Feb-16,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Kinnick...... Like No Place Else.....,"I!!! --- O!!! --- W!!! --- A!!!It happens with the Hawkeyes score a touchdown.The southeast corner begins with - I. Southwest follows with - O. Northeast adds - W. And northeast ends it with - A!!!!! Then it continues - sometimes until the next kickoff. Sometimes clear through the visiting team's possession.It's called atmosphere. It's called Kinnick Stadium.It's hard to watch games in other stadiums, once you're accustomed to Kinnick. You always seem so far away in other places. At Kinnick, there's barely 20 feet between the sideline and Row 1; and the seating steadily increases in slope all the way up to Row 79. That makes for great sight lines, and short distances between fans and players. You're as close to the action as you would be at a high school game, maybe closer. It makes for an intense experience.Recent renovations have made dramatic improvements to concession and rest room facilities, and the video and sound capabilities are now second to none.At Kinnick, we treat visiting fans as we would like to be treated on the road. It's very loud, and you're liable to have to stand most of the game, but visitors are treated like family. Maybe family at a holiday table, arguing about favorite teams, but family.It's a total Big Ten experience. A great way to spend Saturday afternoon."
2733,Date of experience: October 2015,21-Jan-16,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Go Hawks,"What a great stadium to go to and see your beloved Iowa Hawkeyes play a game. Nice big statue of Nile Kinnick out front, nice brick work and beautiful grounds. Better to park on a side street and walk so you can get some good food and buy some shirts. Tailgaiting here is top notch"
2734,Date of experience: November 2015,12-Dec-15,Big Ten,Iowa,4,fun day at the game,"great crowd, sufficient standing room and the final to an amazing season of the hawkeyes.we went there during an unusually snowy weekend and they did a good job cleaning off the field.the seats were still covered so keep that in mind should you ever go on a snowy day!"
2735,Date of experience: November 2015,18-Nov-15,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Grapple on the Gridiron/Football game,"I may be a biased Hawkeyes fan, but you'd be hard pressed to find a better college football atmosphere than what you'll find at Kinnick. Food vendors set up outside the stadium, great crowd, tailgating galore, and still that feel of good ol' Midwestern hospitality!The one possible negative is that there isn't parking right near the stadium, but they have a great shuttle system (bus and train). We generally park at Hancher Auditiorium and take the CamBus from there (it drops you off just a short walk from the stadium)."
2736,Date of experience: November 2015,15-Nov-15,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Grapple on the Gridiron,"History was made with over 42,000 people attending a wrestling meet between the Iowa Hawkeyes and the Tennessee State Cowboys. There were fun activities prior to the match. Every seat has good viewing. The best selection of food is sold by the vendors in the south end zone area. The announcer was very good at explaining  what was happening."
2737,Date of experience: September 2015,1-Nov-15,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Excitement,The stadium oozes excitement. Home to the Hawkeyes. Lots of tailgating and fun happens around this stadium.
2738,Date of experience: November 2015,1-Nov-15,Big Ten,Iowa,5,The Fans Are Awesome,"We were here visiting friends from U of Maryland & to watch the game. The stadium is awesome and a great place to watch the excitement. The Electricity of the fans was unbelievable. Everyone was so involved in the game and with good reason as the Hawks are undefeated.  We were able to walk to the game and see all the fan""s fun along the way.  Had great seats, fun time, good band and was glad to experience the day."
2739,Date of experience: October 2015,10-Oct-15,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Go Hawks!,We attended a game here today.The weather was a sunny comfortable October football game day.This place is a special and magical place to watch a game.The fans know the game and are willing to cheer.We'll be back!Go Hawks!
2740,Date of experience: September 2015,27-Sep-15,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Home of the Hawkeyes,"There are many gates here, it is easy to get to and from the stadium using many different avenues, walk ways and parking lots. Over 80 years old and is classic."
2741,Date of experience: September 2015,27-Sep-15,Big Ten,Iowa,4,Game on!,Kinnick is a great stadium with wonderful fans! There are a lot of fun tailgating lots surrounding the stadium. My only complaint would be that the seating is too tight.
2742,Date of experience: September 2015,9-Sep-15,Big Ten,Iowa,4,Electric - just a few things to adjust,"Game Day in Iowa City is electric and Kinnick Stadium is an excellent conduit for that energy. From the moment ""Back in Black"" hits the recently improved AV system in the stadium, the energy levels become impressive to say the least. Add to that how close the fans are to the field, and it has to be intimidating for even the most seasoned of opposing players. While the downsides are limited, it seems that restroom placement was thought out for quantity but not for traffic. Many of the tunnels to go to your seats are located such that restroom lines can interfere with entry and exit. This becomes a larger issue when fans attempt to depart from the game, as the tunnels are quickly filled and motion is not quick as a result. Overall, the atmosphere in inside, the impressive views from multiple locations in the stadium, and the game day atmosphere as you approach make the trip to Kinnick like few others in the Big Ten. Definitely worth a trip!"
2743,Date of experience: September 2015,9-Sep-15,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Great B1G,"Kinnick Stadium is one of the great places to watch a football game. I've been to many stadiums and Kinnick is the likes of going to Lambeau, Wrigley, Fenway, etc. the charm of the old bricks and the tailgate outside make it a must do if you're near Iowa City in the fall. Scalped tickets can usually be found outside the stadium. The closer to kickoff you wait, the cheaper they are. Iowa fans generally are pretty good folk. They may rib you a little for wearing opponent colors, but largely they will leave you alone."
2744,Date of experience: October 2014,11-Jul-15,Big Ten,Iowa,2,Just not impressed - too tight,"I've been to a number of college stadiums, including Iowa multiple times.  It's not in a bad state - it's fairly nice. However, I've just never enjoyed watching games there. My biggest complaint is seats are just too small.  You basically end up sitting sideways."
2745,Date of experience: October 2014,30-Jun-15,Big Ten,Iowa,4,great fans,When you go to a football game everyone is very excited to cheer for the hawkeyes. The seats are great where ever you sit. The train makes it easy to park and get to the game so bring a smile and have fun.
2746,Date of experience: October 2014,10-Apr-15,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Love this place!,I have had a chance to experience a few games there over the years and it is always a great experience. So much fun tailgating before the game and then watching the Iowa Hawkeyes! If you are a Hawkeye fan you must go to at least one game there in your life.  I plan on taking our daughter in the next couple years.
2747,Date of experience: November 2014,30-Mar-15,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Classic Football Stadium,I've been going to football games in Kinnick for many years now.  I only get back to Iowa City for a couple of games each fall but always look forward to it even if the team isn't doing that well.  I don't think I totally appreciated Kinnick until I had a chance to visit other venues in the Big Ten.  This is first and foremost a classic layout.  The renovations and expansions over the years haven't changed that very significantly.  The most unique aspect is how close the lower stands are to the playing field.  It can't be more than 10 yards away and many visiting players have stated it's one of the most intimidating in the Big Ten because of the crowd involvement right behind their bench.  The other thing I've noticed over the years is that there's hardly a bad seat in the house.  I've purposely sat in different sections and find that I like them all including very high up in the extreme corners.  I love going to football games at Kinnick!
2748,Date of experience: October 2014,24-Mar-15,Big Ten,Iowa,5,"Great stadium, great fans, great atmosphere!",Football Saturdays at Kinnick Stadium are awesome. It's a sea of black and gold with great participation by the fans in support of their Hawkeyes. I've had season tickets for over 35 years and just ordered for next fall. Most seats have an excellent view of the field and there are state of the art screens for replays.It honors an extraordinary leader and war veteran who won the Heisman award and then was killed in WWII. The area around the stadium is filled with tailgaters and booths selling food and Hawkeye stuff. Go early and enjoy the atmosphere of game day.
2749,Date of experience: November 2014,19-Jan-15,Big Ten,Iowa,4,Nice Stadium,"Great place, energetic fans. I was there for media coverage and I will say that they have VERY tight sidelines. So if you are a member of the media, be ready to be walking on your tip toes."
2750,Date of experience: September 2014,29-Dec-14,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Best in Iowa,"There is no better football destination on a fall day in Iowa.  The stadium and area around it becomes a massive black and gold party every home game Saturday.  The Big Ten provides great football action, the seats are very close to the field, and the local fans are as into the game as any in the country."
2751,Date of experience: November 2014,10-Dec-14,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Great Stadium in honor of an outstanding young man,"Nile Kinnick Stadium for the University of Iowa is named in honor of the former Hawkeye halfback and 1939 Heisman Trophy winner.  It is the only stadium in America currently named for a Heisman Trophy winner.  It is a great place to visit for the history as well as the tradition of great football and fans.  (Nile won the 1939 Heisman Trophy, the Maxwell Award and the Walter Camp Trophy (nation's most outstanding football player), was a consensus all-American in 1939, all-Big Ten in 1939, named to numerous All-American teams in 1939, and as Iowa's and Big Ten's Most Valuable Player in 1939.  He was the No. 1 Draft Pick of the Philadelphia Eagles in 1939.  His No. 24 is one of two Iowa football numbers retired."
2752,Date of experience: November 2014,2-Dec-14,Big Ten,Iowa,4,Historic Kinnick Stadium,"Attended the Iowa/Nebraska football game.  Getting in to and out of the stadium was very smooth.  Figure out your parking strategy before you go.  Traffic is very heavy leaving the stadium, so be prepared to wait.   Cell service is nearly non-existent as well."
2753,Date of experience: November 2014,2-Dec-14,Big Ten,Iowa,4,Great stadium,"Beautiful stadium. You are close to the action with the small sidelines. Food service not so hot - literally - food was lukewarm - but we didn't go for the food. Would have been nice to have the snow and ice cleared off our seat beforehand so we didn't have to chip it off with our keys but hey, it was all part of the experience!"
2754,Date of experience: November 2014,29-Nov-14,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Iowa vs Nebraska Go Hawks,"Unfortunately the home team took it on the chin, but the stadium got us in and got us out as efficiently as any large event that I have attended.  Study the parking map before you go.  The softball field is about a 15 minute walk along a concrete bike path and allows easy access to the mall after the game.  However warm you think your shoes and gloves are, its not warm enough. We were in the end zone and there doesn't appear to be any bad seats.  Restrooms and concessions were adequate."
2756,Date of experience: September 2014,8-Oct-14,Big Ten,Iowa,4,Great Football Atmosphere,"We were there for the Iowa v Iowa State game as a family divided. This is a great, old, cool traditional stadium. Know that if you have seats way up, you will be walking up that many stairs and it is high up. There also was not a great selection of food and they don't serve beer (which I know some college stadiums don't). It is impossible to get a cab after a game and the traffic was a terrible mess, but that's not uncommon with stadiums built smack in the middle of neighborhoods like this one. We had a great time and my dad and I were happy to see Iowa State win which did not make most of the people there happy. Fun place with a really great college football feel."
2757,Date of experience: September 2014,20-Sep-14,Big Ten,Iowa,4,Great college football stadium in Iowa heartland,It's great to see a University of Iowa football game here.  It does get very crowded so come early. Bring layers of clothes as it can go from cold to hot to windy to rainy all during one football game.
2758,Date of experience: September 2014,19-Sep-14,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Hawkeyes lost to Cyclones,"Great time at the Airliner downtown on Friday night, after 2 hours the noise gets to be a bit much, great cupcakes at Molly's Cup Cakes 2 doors down from Airliner"
2759,Date of experience: September 2014,16-Sep-14,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Hawkeyes!!,"I have been to Kinnick a number of times, and it is always a fun time watching the Hawkeyes. The latest was a a few days ago during the Iowa-Iowa State football game. There really isn't a bad view from anywhere on the field. The stadium is easily accessible in Iowa City. The best visit was in 2009 during the victory over Michigan. It was a night game in October. Beautiful weather, and a wonderful autumn sunset really added to the experience of being at the stadium. There are a number of parking garage within an easy walk of the stadium, and Iowa City is an interesting city that surrounds the campus and stadium. Be sure to check out the bronze statue of Niles Kinnick on the south side of the stadium, just outside the south entrance. Niles was The lone Heisman Trophy winner who lost his life during WWII while on a training flight."
2761,Date of experience: August 2014,30-Aug-14,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Historic Kinnick Stadium,Nestled in the heart of the U of I campus lies the stadium. It is a smaller venue but loud. Visitor sections are not so good where before much better. To walk up Riverside Drive and Myrtle street to get to Melrose Court thus the stadium it is uphill both ways. hawks fans are generally friendly as long as we win Go Hawks
2762,Date of experience: September 2013,13-May-14,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Perfect setting for a college football game,"If you're a college football fan and haven't been to Kinnick Stadium, you are missing out. The tailgating, iconic brick renovation, and rabid fans make for an unforgettable football experience."
2763,Date of experience: November 2013,4-Dec-13,Big Ten,Iowa,4,"Clean Stadium, Great Atmosphere","I go to multiple Hawkeye games each year as a student.  It's a great place to enjoy a game.  As a Wisconsin Badger fan I don't get as intense watching the games, but I still love seeing the Hawks win! The stadium is clean and very well kept.  It's almost always filled to capacity creating a fantastic atmosphere.  Make sure to tailgate and check out the many food stands across the street on Melrose Ave.  Excellent food and prices over there too!"
2765,Date of experience: October 2013,25-Nov-13,Big Ten,Iowa,5,One of the best football stadiums you can visit!,Recommend at least going to one game in your life. Then hit up downtown Iowa City after which is about a mile walk but beautiful!
2766,Date of experience: November 2013,25-Nov-13,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Great atmosphere,Great game day atmosphere!!  Band and cheerleaders and fans have a lot of enthusiasm.  Fans are fairly good sports and knowledgeable about the fame of football
2767,Date of experience: November 2013,25-Nov-13,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Great game day,"One of College footballs finest stadiums. Very old school, you are close to the field. The atmosphere is electric and very well run. Parking is a little tough, but with some planning not a deal breaker, as with most big venues! Good place for all ages to visit , food is good, rest rooms are plentiful and the experience is awesome!"
2768,Date of experience: November 2013,6-Nov-13,Big Ten,Iowa,4,Would Recommend the Hawkeye Express,"Came here for the Wisconsin game in November. We took the Hawkeye express in for the game and while it is a little pricey it was easy to get to the stadium and easy getting out after the game. My only complaint with the stadium is that there seemed to be 3 women's bathrooms for every men's bathroom, which meant the lines at the men's bathrooms were incredibly long."
2769,Date of experience: November 2013,5-Nov-13,Big Ten,Iowa,5,GOHAWKS!!,"This stadium is just awesome!! My father played football here, so I am very fond of this city as a whole! Easy in, easy out...and the people that work there always seem friendly and confident!"
2770,Date of experience: October 2013,27-Oct-13,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Go Hawks,Great place to watch football. The energy is electric. Win or lose you can't go wrong.  Good college venue.
2771,Date of experience: September 2013,9-Sep-13,Big Ten,Iowa,4,game day,"very nice stadium very clean,this was my first time there so i was pretty excited.on the down side they do not serve beer which i understand why,but was a bit of a downer.The one thing i did not agree with was the did not have a smoking section anywhere and would not allow you to go outside to smoke and come back in..overall it was a great time"
2772,Date of experience: September 2012,11-Aug-13,Big Ten,Iowa,5,One of the last classic stadiums,"Hawkeye football Saturdays are an incredible tradition in Iowa City. Kinnick is the real prize, a beautiful stadium with old school styling but modern touches after the improvements."
2773,Date of experience: October 2012,6-Aug-13,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Hawkeyes Rule,"This is the home of the Iowa Hawkeyes and on game days the entire city of Iowa City and Coralville is taken over by Hawkeye spirit.  The town and the city have a good rapport so the experience is wonderful, not to mention a fabulous marching band."
2774,Date of experience: September 2012,29-Jul-13,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Great game day experience,"I'm a little biased, since I'm an Iowa fan, so keep that in mind. I've been to most other Big 10 stadiums and Kinnick is at the top for overall experience. Firstly, you're in a smaller college town. The ""game"" takes over Iowa City on Saturday. The stadium has residential homes on the south and west, so you're in a neighborhood. This neighborhood area is also where a lot of parking is available. ($20-30 usually) Tailgating is everywhere in the residential areas surrounding. The tailgating also takes place in the west and north parking lots directly around the stadium. (Parking here is reserved for upper level contributors). The stadium has an old feel, but has many recent modern updates. Updated north & south restrooms and also on the west side under the new press box. In the stands, the crowd is loud and into the game. New video screens on both north and south are to appear this coming season - can't wait. (hope the sound improves, it was hit and miss)"
2776,Date of experience: November 2012,9-Jul-13,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Black & Gold forever!,"While the remodeling of the stadium has improved many aspects of the game, the majority remains the same as it has always been. After watching Chuck Long light up the sky for four years and the many stellar stars since, a game at Kinnick is always,sometimes, usually, maybe not enjoyable. After wins the fans are exuberant. After losses the fans think that the current coach needed their assistance. Well, Andre Tippet always made me smile even as a Patriot in the NFL (e.g., Thanks for the tickets against the Bears Andre!). As soon as a miracle occurs and the Hawks remember how to play football intelligently again, Kinnick will once again be the beacon of light that has unfortunately faded to a dull glow."
2777,Date of experience: November 2012,17-Apr-13,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Great environment for a football game!,"Good fans, friendly atmosphere.  Always have a good time.  Tailgating is a must.  Just need to win more games."
2778,Date of experience: September 2012,31-Mar-13,Big Ten,Iowa,5,BIG Venue,"This is the best venue to watch a college football game. It is an historic stadium with the best fans in the country. Hopefully, they Hawks will return to their winning ways. Go Hawks!"
2779,Date of experience: November 2012,25-Mar-13,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Fun and great location,"GREAT STADIUM! the only thing that needs some help is parking. It was very tight. Fans are a lot of fun and very pleasant. I love going, especially since Iowa doesn't have any pro teams! Highly recommend this place. I try to go a few times a year."
2780,Date of experience: September 2012,10-Mar-13,Big Ten,Iowa,3,same old crap,to many rules and regulations to have a very good time. atmosphere is good but comes at a HIGH price. too many fools in the crowd
2783,Date of experience: November 2012,24-Jan-13,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Great venue!,"So much atmosphere and the crowd participation in the Black & Gold seating sections was wonderful! Great tribute to fan teamwork, the state of Iowa and the Iowa Hawkeye program."
2784,Date of experience: October 2012,12-Dec-12,Big Ten,Iowa,5,GO HAWKS!,"Great stadium, not so great team this year. I have enjoyed going to Kinnick since I was a child and now I enjoy taking my kids there to cheer on the Hawkeyes."
2785,Date of experience: September 2012,1-Dec-12,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Home of the Hawkeyes,"What needs to be said? This year was a downer but when the Hawks are good, this place gets LOUD.  This is the center of the Hawkeye Universe and the fans are passionate and the tailgating great."
2786,Date of experience: October 2012,28-Nov-12,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Great Team Spirit,Easy stadium to maneuver through.  Its awesome to see all the black and yellow at PAC 10 games.  The only down side is that there is usually more interesting things to see on the streets leading to the stadium inasmuch as happy hour starts in the wee hours of the mornings before games.
2789,Date of experience: September 2012,28-Oct-12,Big Ten,Iowa,3,Try it once,"I go at least annually to the Hawkeye football games.  It's something every local should experience at least once.  The spirit of the fans is the main spectacle for me, even if the game is lackluster.  I'm not a huge Hawk fan--can take it or leave it, but it's fun to watch people get all worked up and consume mass quantities of beer, hot dogs, pizza, nachos, etc.  The seats are not comfortable if you're in the stands.  The sound system's volume fluctuates greatly.  Consider the position of the sun during game time before you get your tickets, because you can come away with a nice sun burn if not prepared."
2790,Date of experience: November 2011,27-Oct-12,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Best place in Iowa!,There is nothing better than Kinnick Stadium on game day!  It is so much fun to tailgate before the game!  Love Kinnick! GO HAWKS!
2791,Date of experience: October 2011,26-Sep-12,Big Ten,Iowa,4,Can't beat the feeling,"Yes, it's easier to sit at home and watch the Hawkeyes play, but nothing can beat the feeling of being there in person with 70,000 other fans. The excitement, the noise, the camraderie."
2792,Date of experience: September 2012,17-Sep-12,Big Ten,Iowa,5,FOOTBALL,Iowa Hawkeyes football.  I was in gold on the left in picture here.Always neat half time show in addition to some exciting football (usually).
2793,Date of experience: September 2012,17-Sep-12,Big Ten,Iowa,4,Game day,Loved the game and stadium.  But be careful parking we got a $15 ticket because they rotate sides of streets to park on and no signs indicating this and we are from out of town and did not know that.
2794,Date of experience: September 2012,17-Sep-12,Big Ten,Iowa,4,Hawkeyes,College football is a must see in one's life and this is a great place to do so. Tickets can get rather pricey because the fans are SO dedicated but you can happen upon decent priced tickets if you look long enough. Definitely plan to tailgate before the game as that is part of the experience. Take your cooler and your grill along with your awning and prepare for a long pregaming time. Getting into the game does not take long as lines move quickly but they come to an abrupt halt once under the stadium seating. Longs lines for restrooms and food stands are always part of the day. Prices are average for stadium food and drink. Seating is decent and if you are lucky enough to have stadium backs those are helpful. All seats are good and it just depends on where you want to be. We have been on the 20 in the middle of hundreds of people and we have been on the 50 in the last row. Both seats equally good just different views. The scoreboard is nice. The halftime show is average. The stadium views are nice. It is a great campus to walk around if you choose to do so. You can ride the train to the game if you want. That will keep you from dodging all of the traffic both in and out of the stadium. But you still get to sit and wait when you are leaving. Traffic is slow and not well planned out. Traffic volunteers don't really focus on getting cars out quickly. You are better off waiting a half and hour and then driving straight out. We will definitely return as it is a great way to spend a Saturday. Fans are usually pretty nice. Some get a little overzealous when it comes to partaking before the game but that is part of any game day IMO. Family friendly if you want it to be. Great for that weekend mancation/galcation or couples and friends.
2795,Date of experience: September 2012,17-Sep-12,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Best venue in Big 10 for atmsosphere,"Maybe not as big as the Big House or the Horseshoe, bue for rabid, close-to-the-action excitement, there is no place better to watch a game than Kinnick Stadium."
2796,Date of experience: October 2011,17-Sep-12,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Excellent Stadium  and it is Nile Kinnick,"A bandbox of a stadium, one is seated right up on the field.  Named after all time great Nile Kinnick, the greatest Iowan ever.  Great football player, person, and war hero.  Many say he would have been governor had he not been killed in World War II."
2797,Date of experience: October 2011,15-Sep-12,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Great place to watch football,The Kinnick Stadium is something everyone should have at least once in a life.  Seats are close to the field.  Best Stadium I have ever been to see a game.
2799,Date of experience: August 2012,10-Aug-12,Big Ten,Iowa,5,Fantastic Football!,"We love going to Kinnick for football games.  In addition, the Athletic department hosts special events for the public.  It's a beautiful stadium."
2800,Date of experience: November 2011,5-Aug-12,Big Ten,Iowa,5,College Football att its best,"Tailgating is great....people couldn't have been nicer, the game atmosphere was absolutely electric.  I'm going again this fall."
2801,Date of experience: October 2022,10-Oct-22,Big Ten,Indiana,1,Some things never change!,New tiered ticket options suck for a team that only won 2 games last year. Parking option are not much better. But the worst part about an IU football game next to the horrible team are the concession stands in the stadium. Standing in line for an hour for a hot dog and a beer WTF !!!! Watching an elderly man or women working behind the counter with an old fashioned calculator or pencil and paper trying to add up your total cost is something from the 1950's. Most of the staff appeared as if they were hired from a local nursing home. Nice people but just not up to take on the job on a busy day. Plain and simply IU Memorial Stadium SUCKS!
2802,Date of experience: September 2022,13-Sep-22,Big Ten,Indiana,1,"With renovations, a lot still not fan friendly!","Terrible concession options, terrible bathroom options, totally not designed to handle rain! Seats are ok? Need seat with back options for all patrons!!! Dangerously slippery flooring in the main concourse under stadium in the East and West sections of the stadium."
2804,Date of experience: November 2019,11-Dec-19,Big Ten,Indiana,5,Great experience!,"This was our first trip to I.U. and we were supporting the visiting team. The stadium was easy to navigate & looked great. The weather prevented us from a long tailgating experience but did enjoy the lots & everyone in them. The fanbase was incredible!!! While maize & blue from head to toe, we were welcomed by everyone we encountered. Extremely happy my daughter's first road game could be with such a great fanbase."
2805,Date of experience: September 2019,21-Sep-19,Big Ten,Indiana,4,IU FOOTBALL,"We went to the IU football game and they won. The staff at the connections next to Sec.7 are fast and friendly. They now serve alcohol at games. They do ID you. The parking tho, unless you have a parking pass for the gates 1-14 you half to find parking somewhere else. The church across the road has it for 20.00 on game day. The band is awesome also."
2806,Date of experience: September 2019,19-Sep-19,Big Ten,Indiana,4,Good venue,"Except for the total lack of shade, this is a very good stadium for football. Concessions could be more numerous or they could be set so the beer or pretzel only lines did not compete with the full service lines."
2807,Date of experience: September 2019,8-Sep-19,Big Ten,Indiana,5,IU Football Blowout,"I had looked at all of the on site parking and made a note of which gates did not require a permit. Well...guess what. We drove all the way around the stadium and EVERY gate required a parking permit. You might want to get your act together to clarify this. We got tickets for free at the last minute and I could not order a pass from their parking affairs office, whatever its called. Here's a hint, park at the church on the corner across the street just Northwest of the stadium. Give em' a twenty and its super easy to get out, plus I could see our vehicle from the top of the stadium. We did get to see history in the making as the Hoosiers won by the largest margin since the stadium was built. All in all a great experience."
2809,Date of experience: January 2019,3-Feb-19,Big Ten,Indiana,5,A Whole New Stadium,So many new additions in the past few years. Well worth spending some time to check it all out. Like a history lesson in IU sports and the Hoosiers.
2810,Date of experience: November 2018,7-Jan-19,Big Ten,Indiana,5,Great stadium,This place is awesome to attend football games! It??s has an energy to it even as you approach the area
2811,Date of experience: November 2018,13-Dec-18,Big Ten,Indiana,5,Nice stadium,"Nice area to walk around and take in the sights, It was Thanksgiving weekend so we strolled around the stadiums."
2812,Date of experience: November 2018,10-Nov-18,Big Ten,Indiana,3,Keep renivating,"I went to a game.  The staff and university want everyone to have a safe and enjoyable experience,  There had been some snow the night before and most had been cleared.  There was a concession stand closed near my section because of some kind of water issue.  One major complaint was the lack of hot/warm water in the restroom.  When it is already freezing, literally, it is not enjoyable to wash your hands in very cold water.  If hot water is not available maybe some hand sanitizer.  The stadium is beautiful and a good time for all."
2813,Date of experience: September 2018,3-Oct-18,Big Ten,Indiana,4,Updates improved it greatly!,We love going to games at the stadium. The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because we get REALLY wet when it rains.  Which I know is standard. I just wish it weren't so!
2814,Date of experience: November 2017,2-Oct-18,Big Ten,Indiana,5,A Real Experience,"The Indiana University Memorial Stadium is a real experience. The recent renovations and additions to the facility make it one of the best college football stadiums I have seen. Also, the digital displays and interactive camera work are a wonderful augmentation to any home football game. Even if you are not that into football, you can still have a wonderful fall experience. Tailgating is a big deal in the lots and fields around the stadium, but be sure to save some room for snacks during the game."
2815,Date of experience: September 2018,25-Sep-18,Big Ten,Indiana,5,Rental of seat pad with backs saved the day.,High up seats okay. lighting for night games was not as good as it could have been for attendees - guess it is okay game Knot Hole gang area is a great feature. Food was good
2816,Date of experience: September 2018,23-Sep-18,Big Ten,Indiana,5,Family Atmosphere,"In town for parents weekend, and took in the IU v Michigan State game.  While the Hoosiers didn't win, it was a great time for all.  Clean, family friendly environment.  Good food choices at reasonable prices, and minimal lines.  Definitely looking forward to the next game!"
2817,Date of experience: September 2017,29-May-18,Big Ten,Indiana,4,GO HOOOOOOSIERS!,We had a great time at the football game.  There really is not a bad seat in the stadium. Definitely enjoyed the tailgating prior to the game...that is a must to get the full experience!
2818,Date of experience: October 2017,13-Mar-18,Big Ten,Indiana,5,Nice facilities,"Plenty of seating for a good view of the game; huge, state of the art work out room; practice fields of grass, artificial turf and and an indoor practice field.  Currently building an edition to the south end zone to completely enclose the field which will include new eating facility for student athletes, more seating, etc..."
2819,Date of experience: November 2017,6-Nov-17,Big Ten,Indiana,5,Fun place to see the Hoosiers,Great stadium that is easily accessible. Food is ok. All would be better if the home team was more competitve.
2820,Date of experience: October 2017,31-Oct-17,Big Ten,Indiana,3,Not much to talk about,"Went to Memorial Stadium for the second time this year. Both times I was a fan of the visiting team. My first visit two years ago was disappointing as some fans thought it was a good idea to yell vulgarities at a small group of people with an 8 year old with them. We had no child with us this year and the fans were much nicer as well. The atmosphere was better this year as well, maybe due to the fact that it was a night game and the weather was nice. The stadium itself is nothing special and offers only basic food options. If you're looking for a fancy stadium with lots of amenities and food options you won't find that here. You will however find a suitable place to watch a football game."
2821,Date of experience: October 2017,18-Oct-17,Big Ten,Indiana,4,Let the rain wash over me,"Aside from renovations taking place in one end zone, which can affect the charm, it was a great game. I went to the Indiana vs. Charleston Southern game, and we stayed despite a driving rain storm the entire time. For both of us, it was the most fun we had in a while."
2822,Date of experience: October 2017,17-Oct-17,Big Ten,Indiana,4,Michigan @ IU 10/14/17,"Not a bad seat in the house, great sight lines to watch football. Concession stand prices not bad, $7 gets you free drink refills. The tailgate crowd seems to have a good time. Only downside is parking, apparently you have to get a pass to pay to park and I did not know that, spent two hours searching for parking and that was about 2 miles away. The fans were friendly (we are Michigan fans) and we had fun. Just IU fix the parking problem!!"
2823,Date of experience: October 2017,14-Oct-17,Big Ten,Indiana,4,Michigan at IU,"Fun, fun place to watch college football. Currently the stadium is undergoing major renovations/additions so the construction is a downside. But we had beautiful weather and great views of the game, even from Row 60, which is fairly high up. Game was sold out, so approximately 53K fans in attendance. I went to go a snow cone (Kona Ice is the best!) about 6-8 minutes before the half and the concourse wasn't terribly busy. But by closer to halftime, concessions had long lines. The people working the game were super helpful. Two different people who answered questions for us were extremely nice, helpful and friendly."
2824,Date of experience: September 2017,11-Oct-17,Big Ten,Indiana,5,Nice place.  Too bad we never seem to win here,"IU alum family here.  We always enjoy Memorial Stadium.  They seriously need some covered parking (underground with connections, maybe?) because I'd hate to do all this in the colder months."
2825,Date of experience: August 2017,3-Oct-17,Big Ten,Indiana,3,"A beautiful, world-class, facility","A great venue for a Saturdyay afternoon.  The team though, hovers in the middle of the conference.  (Remeber, this is a research university.)"
2826,Date of experience: September 2017,25-Sep-17,Big Ten,Indiana,5,Go Hoosiers!!!,Great user friendly place to see a Big 10 game. Not crowded. Easy to get to. Decent seating. Good ancillary services.
2827,Date of experience: August 2017,6-Sep-17,Big Ten,Indiana,5,Ohio State crowd should be the norm.,The place was rocking into the third quarter.  The team deserves this kind of support every game.  The facility will be stunning when the construction is complete.
2828,Date of experience: August 2017,6-Sep-17,Big Ten,Indiana,5,Indiana University Football,"IU may not have the best football team in the BIG10 but it's still worth a trip to Memorial Stadium to see the Hoosiers play. BIG10 football is big time college football, and again, even if the Hoosiers do not win, they are exciting to watch. Tom Allen and his staff has a team that never quits and can play with anybody. The stadium has very good sight lines and there is very good on site parking."
2829,Date of experience: August 2017,6-Sep-17,Big Ten,Indiana,5,Sold Out Game!,"My brother-in-law invited me to the season opener Vs. Ohio State.  This visit was the best experience I have ever had at Memorial Stadium.  It was a sold out game so there wasn't much room to stretch out.  I overheard several OSU fans commenting on how cheap the concessions were compared to other stadiums.  Overall, this would be a great venue to join your family or friends to enjoy a college football game.The downside of the stadium is that there is no alcohol permitted."
2830,Date of experience: August 2017,2-Sep-17,Big Ten,Indiana,4,Very nice campus,"Came to Memorial Stadium to watch the Buckeyes and the Hoosiers. Very nice stadium, not a bad seat anywhere. The ticket prices were great compared to the ridiculous Ohio State football prices. Plenty of parking close to the stadium and the Hoosier fans were very friendly."
2831,Date of experience: September 2017,1-Sep-17,Big Ten,Indiana,4,Fun place to watch a football game,There's not a bad seat in the house! We sat at the goal line and approximately 30 rows from the field and had a great view of the entire field. Polite local fans!  If there is one downside it's that the video board is relatively small and replays on it are not all that visible.
2832,Date of experience: August 2017,1-Sep-17,Big Ten,Indiana,4,Rod47172 kicks off,Football 2017 underway.  Construction equipment tightens up parking.  Restrooms clean.  Some lines for food.  Attendants helpful.  New security did not delay entry into stadium.  Traffic handled without problems.
2833,Date of experience: September 2017,1-Sep-17,Big Ten,Indiana,4,Fun place for a game,Good facilities for a college football game. Good tailgate atmosphere. Very friendly home team fans. No bad seats. Good food selection on the lower level. I recommend the BBQ excellent pulled pork.
2834,Date of experience: September 2016,18-Aug-17,Big Ten,Indiana,5,Great place to see a game!!!!!,IU football getting better every year.  Best tailgates in the Midwest!!!  Plenty of tickets on line.  inexpensive.  good stadium food.  clean bathrooms.
2835,Date of experience: September 2016,18-Jul-17,Big Ten,Indiana,5,Great place to watch a game!!,"Ticket prices are reasonable, the fans are kind and the tailgating is out of this world! If you've never tailgated outside Memorial Stadium it is a must before going in to cheer on your favorite team. The stadium is a great place for a family outing and to let your kids experience a college game without breaking the bank. In the past they have offered a family 4 pack which is a fantastic value! Go Hoosiers!"
2837,Date of experience: November 2016,19-Apr-17,Big Ten,Indiana,5,IU Football,"The Staduim is small. Most games dont have that great of attendance, I buy cheap nose bleed tickets and then after the first quarter I move down to the lower level."
2838,Date of experience: October 2016,2-Mar-17,Big Ten,Indiana,5,PSU game,"Came from PA to see daughter at IU.  Pleasantly surprised by attractive older stadium.  Did not eat at stadium but did use the free tail gate spots further from stadium.  Area was not too crowded but every car had space for table, etc. Bathrooms were nearby and we had the opportunity to grill.  Had great weather which made it a great day."
2839,Date of experience: September 2016,28-Feb-17,Big Ten,Indiana,5,A Fun Time,Waht a great time on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. It was actually hot that day. This is a fun place to watch football. Nice and clean and well kept.Always a lot going on and they have made some improvements to the stadium since we were last here. The best thing is that IU won.
2840,Date of experience: November 2016,15-Nov-16,Big Ten,Indiana,4,Indiana Football Stadium,"Nice, old school stadium. Great area for tailgating and buying food and beer, nice public beer garden adjacent to stadium. No bad seats. Great place to see a college game."
2841,Date of experience: November 2015,26-Oct-16,Big Ten,Indiana,4,Well it's IU football after all,"Even if the team isn't performing THE BAND IS ALWAYS GREAT. The newer additions to the stadium are very nice, and there is a special place for kids on the field level to keep then entertained during the long game. We tailgate better than most places and Hoosier Hospitality means we are willing to share."
2842,Date of experience: October 2016,18-Oct-16,Big Ten,Indiana,5,IU Football game,Attended Indiana vs Nebraska football game. First time at the stadium.Enjoyed smaller venue. All areas were clean. All staff from gates to food were great.
2843,Date of experience: October 2016,17-Oct-16,Big Ten,Indiana,4,Nice place to watch a football game,"Even though we were even with the end zone, the seats offered pretty good viewing.  They have upgraded the parking areas around the stadium for tailgaters.  A lot of paved spaces as well as grassy spaces."
2844,Date of experience: October 2016,15-Oct-16,Big Ten,Indiana,5,OUTSTANDING FANS,Visited Memorial Stadium for the Indiana vs Nebraska game. The Hoosier fans are definitely a class act. Very friendly and nice!
2845,Date of experience: October 2016,15-Oct-16,Big Ten,Indiana,4,Game day with nice fans,"Not a sellout but friendly to opposing fans. Tailgating not that impressive but the Hoosier band, Marching 100 was amazing.  Wish there were seat backs!"
2846,Date of experience: October 2016,6-Oct-16,Big Ten,Indiana,4,Hoosier Red,"Paid a visit to Bloomington IN with my buddies for the annual away football contest to witness our alma mater, Michigan State take on IU. Enjoyed the experience around Hoosier Village and Memorial Stadium is a beautiful venue for a college football game.  All good except the final score."
2847,Date of experience: September 2016,3-Oct-16,Big Ten,Indiana,5,Family Weekend,"Family weekend would not be complete without going to a game at the Memorial Statium.  Even though we lost the game, it was fun to cheer on the team.  Hoosier Momma!"
2848,Date of experience: September 2016,29-Sep-16,Big Ten,Indiana,4,First IU Game,I went to my first IU game during Family Weekend . Lots of people tailgating . Was lots of fun but a Very hot day and the metal seats were hot. Would bring a cushion next time.
2849,Date of experience: September 2016,19-Sep-16,Big Ten,Indiana,4,"""A Great Place To Watch Football.""","We recently attended the Indiana University vs. Ball State University football game in Memorial Stadium on Saturday, Sept. 10th.  The morning skies were somewhat overcast, but in the afternoon, the skies turned near perfect.  This made for a great football game viewing experience.  In the first three quarters, the IU team scored at will, but in the final quarter, Ball State came back to make a game of it.  Final score, IU 30, BSU 20. Our son purchased seats way up on the 60th row on the east side, so we could see the whole stadium.  However, there were many empty seats . . . not during a game with Ohio State, Michigan or Michigan State.  With the addition of the north stadium, now it is a horseshoe-shaped arena.  I can remember when IU placed fieldturf or astroturf, artificial turf on the playing field.  It was a bright green color, too bright for the average spectator.  Now, the field has natural grass turf and it looks and plays better.  Being a Ball State alumnus, it would have been better to see our team win, but the overall experience was great . . .since both of our children graduated from Indiana University."
2850,Date of experience: October 2015,23-May-16,Big Ten,Indiana,5,Pretty cool stadium for a crappy team,I go to IU and I go to all the football games.  I cannot believe we do not have a better football team just because this stadium and our facilities are amazing.  I wish the stadium filled up a lot more but it's a great place to watch a game.
2852,Date of experience: November 2015,14-Jan-16,Big Ten,Indiana,5,Great experience,"Close/cheap parking, avg concessions and a great stadium to watch football in. Extremely friendly IU fans. The best gameday experience I have ever had at a road game. Very classy fans. This is somewhere you can take your kids. Would definaty recommend it and will go back when we play there again."
2853,Date of experience: November 2015,19-Nov-15,Big Ten,Indiana,5,First Visit to Memorial Stadium,"We came into town for a game. Had a great time tailgating. Everyone was very welcoming. The stadium is a lot smaller than we are used to, but very nice. Seats are pretty good from anywhere. The concession stand prices were farely cheap for stadium food. They have a nice play area for kids behind the end zone. Looking forward to our next game at Memorial Stadium!"
2854,Date of experience: November 2015,15-Nov-15,Big Ten,Indiana,3,Football game,Wasnt a sell out when I went. Dont feel too close to the game. Concourse is ok. Concession are cheap compared to other stadiums. Did like the USS Indiana pieces in front of the stadium.
2855,Date of experience: September 2015,14-Oct-15,Big Ten,Indiana,4,Upgrades are really nice.,"Hadn't been here in a couple years and the new building in the end zone is a great addition and looks really nice.  Game atmosphere could've been better because it didn't seem all that loud, but it wasn't a conference game either. Stadium is very clean and easy to navigate.  The booths with local snacks, like popcorn, were great."
2856,Date of experience: November 2014,7-Oct-15,Big Ten,Indiana,5,Great stadium and always fun especially if the Hoosiers are winning,"Have gone down to this stadium several times to cheer on the Hoosiers.  Some years, that is harder than others, but all in all a great destination for a football fan and/or an IU fan."
2857,Date of experience: October 2015,4-Oct-15,Big Ten,Indiana,3,Ohio State Football game with IU,"Nice location, large close by parking lots. Easy to get to and exit parking lot. Wished the dreaded porta pots in parking lots were checked throughout tailgating for supplies and cleanliness. Higher seats in stadium lacked hand rails on steps...didn't like that!"
2858,Date of experience: October 2015,4-Oct-15,Big Ten,Indiana,5,"""Big Ten Football""","We enjoyed our first trip to Memorial Stadium. We were able to park near the stadium, enjoyed the game day experiences near the stadium and our seats were excellent. Exciting game between the Buckeyes and Hoosiers and we enjoyed visiting IU."
2859,Date of experience: September 2015,3-Oct-15,Big Ten,Indiana,4,Beautiful stadium,We went to a football game during Freshman parents weekend and had no problem obtaining good seats in this spacious stadium. The stadium itself is well-built and attractive. There are fun areas to walk through when not in your seats. It didn't hurt that the Hoosiers won!
2860,Date of experience: September 2015,20-Sep-15,Big Ten,Indiana,5,Nice roomy stadium.,"There is no upper deck to this stadium.  The sides are somewhat steep, and all lines if sight are good.  You can rent a cushioned seat if you don't want to sit on the hard metal bench seats.  The concourse area where the concessions are located is wide and roomy.  The food selection is very good and, as in stadiums, expensive.  You cannot take a water bottle with fluid in it into the stadium, but you can take in an empty bottle.  However, the city of Bloomington provides free water bottles and water, and there are water fill stations.  So you are not forced to buy soda or water, which is done in most stadiums.  The north end is new and very nice.  There are some kinds of food available on the east side that are not sold on the west side, so it is worth wandering over there to take a look.  There are parking lots and fields available for tailgating.  The fields across 17th Street have trees and are wonderful for tailgating if you don't mind a few drunks.  All in all, a very nice stadium with all the amenities."
2861,Date of experience: September 2015,20-Sep-15,Big Ten,Indiana,5,Football,The 2015 is off to a great start at 3-0. More big things to come hopefully. Very nice touch allowing the freshman class to run out the first game leading the football team.
2862,Date of experience: September 2015,18-Sep-15,Big Ten,Indiana,4,Cheap seats and entertaining venue,"As soon as you walk up to the stadium you can tell they've put some love into it recently.  The stadium is older and has had some years of neglect but recently the university has invested heavily.  Many improvements and more to come.  There are lots of choices when it comes to food fare.  The bathrooms are disgusting, maintained well-enough but they're dark, not up-to-date at all."
2863,Date of experience: September 2015,15-Sep-15,Big Ten,Indiana,5,Football Fun,"My son goes to IU and I visited him and we attended the Indiana University vs Florida International football game.  The stadium is easy to get to and the parking is not a problem.  The tickets are reasonably priced compared to some of the other Big Ten stadiums and readily available.  The stadium was only about 1/2 full, but the home team fans were very vocal.  The band is seated in the closed end of the horseshoe and easily heard.  Entertaining halftime show and a lot of energy. The student 'tailgate' parties are located across the street from the stadium.  Food is available and the prices are good.  Adequate bathroom facilities throughout."
2864,Date of experience: September 2015,9-Sep-15,Big Ten,Indiana,5,Hoosiers! Go IU ~,"Our gamedays have improved and make a fabulous day for family, friends, and students. There is something for everyone. The facilities are clean, updated, and the team is looking good and fun to watch.  As a sports fan, Memorial Stadium is awesome!"
2865,Date of experience: September 2015,7-Sep-15,Big Ten,Indiana,3,Game day needs a makeover!,The game day experience needs help! The band's 70's cop theme halftime show wasn't good. The games in between time outs were  not fun for the spectators. There needs to be more energy and excitement!
2866,Date of experience: October 2014,1-Sep-15,Big Ten,Indiana,5,Great Place to Watch a Game,"They have really done a lot of work on this stadium.  It was built in the 60's, but the additions in the endzone areas and around the facility make it quite nice.  It is really a great place to watch a game."
2867,Date of experience: October 2014,22-Aug-15,Big Ten,Indiana,5,THE ROCK,"Great stadium and great atmosphere at games.  The did a great job turning it into ""The Rock."" Tailgating is also fun.  Go Cream and Crimson!"
2868,Date of experience: August 2015,4-Aug-15,Big Ten,Indiana,5,Nice Looking Stadium.,Attending a wedding reception held at the North End Zone.  Best view and location I've seen for a wedding reception!  Had a great time!
2869,Date of experience: November 2014,28-Jul-15,Big Ten,Indiana,5,IU Memorial Stadium,Love attending sporting events at Memorial Stadium. Parking is simple and easy in/out. Tickets are affordable and there really isn't a bad seat.
2870,Date of experience: August 2014,7-Jul-15,Big Ten,Indiana,4,Watching IU football games was a great time!,Nice stadium with plenty of parking.  Shuttle service will take you to your car if you had to park a distance away.  That was really great!
2871,Date of experience: October 2014,25-Jun-15,Big Ten,Indiana,5,Hoosier Girl,Been here many times...both in and outside the stadium:)  Parking is good but you go for the thrill of watching the fans!
2872,Date of experience: October 2014,4-Jun-15,Big Ten,Indiana,4,Great view from any seat in the stadium!,"My husband loves I.U. football.  We can only go to a couple of games a year so its a special time when we do see I.U. play.  Since the stadium was renovated (and the end zone closed with seating) it is a delight to go as every seat has a great view of the action down on the field.My only dislike is the ramp system to get to the upper decks.  We have to park quite a distance & walk(as we don't belong to one of the I.U. 'clubs' that get closer parking at a premium price), and then climb/walk UP the ramps to the top only to walk back down the steep stairs to our seats.  I have difficulty walking at times but I am not 'disabled' by medical standards.   By the time I get to my seat, I don't move until the game is over!  I don't think this is an issue for many people but for those older or with difficulty walking at times this makes going less often an easier choice."
2874,Date of experience: September 2014,1-Apr-15,Big Ten,Indiana,4,State of the art stadium.,This beautiful modern stadium has all the amenities. Come early on game days though as traffic and parking are at a premium then. Lots of space to tailgate in. RV's can park overnight. Not a bad seat in the house.
2876,Date of experience: September 2014,18-Feb-15,Big Ten,Indiana,4,Football game,Old stadium with new gizmos.  Fred Glass has done a nice job of upgrading the experience.  Now all we need is a good football team.
2877,Date of experience: November 2014,15-Nov-14,Big Ten,Indiana,5,Great place to enjoy a day of football and tailgating,"I went to my first (definitely not my last!) football game at Memorial Stadium last weekend when IU faced Penn State.  Not a great weather day, but that was the only con.  Beautiful fields for tailgating all around the stadium.  The stadium is really, really nice.  We had great seats and not expensive.  Very clean with lots of people around to show you to your seats.  Unfortunately IU lost, but the band, pep squad, cheerleaders, and all the other extracurricular stuff made it really enjoyable.  Huge shout out to the band and the IU Red Steppers for a fantastic halftime show.  Will definitely plan to go to a game earlier in the season next year so the weather will be a bit nicer."
2879,Date of experience: November 2014,9-Nov-14,Big Ten,Indiana,4,Beautiful stadium,"This is such a nice stadium. I have been there for a handful of FB games. I usually follow ND but since my daughter is at IU I try to get down there for a few. Compared to ND, it is light years ahead. The jumbo-tron, the restrooms are in great shape. Very easy to get around. I always enjoy the atmosphere outside as well. Lots of great tailgating. I just wish they could get better in FB to take advantage of the beautiful venue! Would be great for a concert too!"
2881,Date of experience: October 2014,7-Oct-14,Big Ten,Indiana,5,great views abound,"very, very nice stadium !Witnessed IU trounce N. Texas State. Excellent seating/viewing from all angles"
2882,Date of experience: September 2014,29-Sep-14,Big Ten,Indiana,5,"Great stadium, fun place to tailgate, football team could be better.","IU has a great football stadium.  The location is outstanding, with a lot of good outside areas for tailgating, and I certainly recommend the grass fields over the parking lot, but depends what you like.  The stadium itself is clean and modern with great views from the seats; not really a bad seat in the house.  There are plenty of restrooms and concessions, so no worries there as well.  Given the layout, you can well be in the sun all day, so sun screen is a must if you are going in sunny weather.  As to the football team itself, I have seen good games and ones where the breaks don??t quite go our way."
2883,Date of experience: December 2013,6-Dec-13,Big Ten,Indiana,5,great game won the bucket!!,"what an experience,i.u played purdue for the oaken bucket and won.first american football game and not dissapointed loved the whole days events.great stadium clean,well laid out etc."
2884,Date of experience: November 2013,7-Nov-13,Big Ten,Indiana,5,Great place to watch a football game,"Memorial Stadium is home to the IU footballs team and is located on the northwest corner of the IU campus in Bloomington, Indiana.   The stadium is also known as ??the Rock?? (I have no idea why). There is a large rock near the north end zone called Hep??s Rock but I think the stadium got the nickname before that rock was placed there.  The stadium was built in 1960 and has been remodeled a few times since then.  The playing surface is Field Turf which is probably the best type of artificial turf.  Since the Stadium was built in the 1960??s the place does not have any Executive Boxes (unless they were on the bottom of the small press box, up high on the west sideline).I went to Memorial Stadium in November with my wife to watch the IU vs. Minnesota football game and had a great time.  The place holds about 53,000 and it was about 70% full at the start of the game (there were lots of empty seats).  The stadium and the tailgating outside make for a great college atmosphere.   The seats are very close to the field so almost every seat in the stadium is decent. The food prices in the stadium were very reasonable and we ate some awesome caramel corn. The game was very close at the end of the game and I was surprised by how many IU fans left early. They might have been trying to beat the traffic as the roads near the stadium are skinny.  At the end of the south end zone is a kid??s play area called Knothole Park. This is a small mini football field where tons of kids spent the entire game tossing footballs back and forth. I was surprised that they did not appear to be watching the game at all.  The pregame tailgating parties looked awesome. They have lots of open areas and grassy areas outside the stadium grounds where you can park and then tailgate.  The students know how to party as I was amazed by the amount of empty beer cans and booze bottles left behind at the student houses near the stadium.Overall I thought Memorial Stadium was a great place to watch a college football game and I had a great time."
2885,Date of experience: October 2013,5-Oct-13,Big Ten,Indiana,5,Great Atmosphere for a Football Game,"Great venue ... it is a shame that they do not have a greater fan base ... they have all the pieces in place but 59,000 fans"
2886,Date of experience: September 2013,22-Sep-13,Big Ten,Indiana,4,Good place to see a game,"They don't sellout so getting tickets was easy. Plus it was probably the cheapest college game I've bought in years. We paid only $40 from the school. Parking on the lots right next to the stadium was only $20. Food and drinks were reasonable. $6 pizza, $3 water and $5 brats. Traffic was light after the game because all the Indiana fans left early. Lots of students only go to party across the street in the fields and don't even attend the games. Pretty much any seat is a good one. Staff is friendly and easy going. I noticed it wasn't too hard to sneak in beverages. At half time you can get your ticket scanned to leave and then get back in. Tailgating is allowed and lot 9 is good if you want plenty of space while being very close."
2887,Date of experience: November 2022,19-Nov-22,Big Ten,Maryland,1,Stupid policies,Wouldn??t let me buy my own wife a beer what is their problem? Trying to watch football as a couple here is a serious pain.
2889,Date of experience: November 2019,5-Dec-19,Big Ten,Maryland,4,Small Stadium with Nice Perks,"We travel to see our team play a different Big 10 school each year and this year in was UM.  We were easily able to get great seats on the visitor's side 50 yard line, 300 level, through a third party website.  Reasonable price, great view - including the Capital and Washington Monument in the distance despite the dreary, rainy day.  Concourses are nicely wide with plenty of walking space.  Lots of restrooms that had HEAT.  Plenty of concessions stands with some unique Maryland dishes offered, which was great.  Wish some of those specialties were offered in more than one location though.  Sound system, video and entertainment were very good.  Data connectivity was excellent compared to many other stadiums.  Sad that it was a low attendance, but the weather and holiday likely both played a role.The only drawback we saw was the way the bench seats are installed somewhat flush to the concrete steps.  There is a little lip behind your backside, so gives a tiny bit of support, but the huge downside was noticed later in the game.  The rain had made the steps quite slippery and a young girl indeed lost her footing.  All we could do was watch in horror as she proceeded to roll down 4-5 more rows (about 12 steps) until her neck/chest caught on one of the railings to stop her.  It was so scary.  Someone ran to get help and it arrived quickly.  She was eventually able to walk with assistance down the stairs for I assume further attention.  The fact that all the benches are flush means that it's basically a big slope with nothing to slow you down if you fall!  We thought about her the rest of our trip and we hope that she is okay...  Something needs to be adjusted to keep that from happening - even without rain, one wrong step and someone could be falling for a while."
2890,Date of experience: December 2019,3-Dec-19,Big Ten,Maryland,3,"Decent Stadium, Hometeam Fans Rude","Not generally known as a football school, the stadium is about what is expected for being in the Big10 conference.   The stadium entrance was easy and quick, the seats all seemed to be good as others have said, although I can't speak for the upper decks.The parking lots were semi-full, not sold out even the night before, and lots of tailgating.  The campus is not a dry campus and (costly) beer is sold in the stadium, so get your fill before you enter.The fans weren't too welcoming though as other Big10 schools, and one ever ripped up my sign near the end of the game.  Un-welcome to Maryland!"
2891,Date of experience: November 2019,4-Nov-19,Big Ten,Maryland,4,Great game venu,Attended a game here and was amazed at how small the place is.  But there is not a bad seat in the place.  Even the upper levels allow for an excellent view of the action.  Makes one feel up close and personal to the action. Was a bit slow entering through the gates as the private security were not the quickest ever so we missed the opening kickoff/kick return!  Beer prices.......COME ON!!!!  12oz of blue moon $10.  Who thinks this is acceptable?  Food was reasonably priced and good.  All in all a good time......I recommend stay far away from the beer though!
2892,Date of experience: September 2019,15-Oct-19,Big Ten,Maryland,3,Average stadium with good service.,"I visited this stadium for the first time when Maryland played Penn state.  The access is somewhat limited which makes for some long backed up lines.  The seats are typical college bleacher type seats, pretty normal and average.  The concession stands were staffed with pretty competent friendly people."
2893,Date of experience: October 2019,6-Oct-19,Big Ten,Maryland,4,Good stadium to see an event,"The only bad thing is finding the stadium, then parking. Same problem at most stadiums. All seats seem to be good for viewing. Was clean."
2894,Date of experience: September 2019,1-Oct-19,Big Ten,Maryland,4,Great win for Penn State!,Visited this stadium for the first time in September for a Penn State vs Maryland game!  Was very impressed with the access and facilities.  All of the seats stadium bench style (Aluminum) but you can rent padded stadium seats.  Was fun to watch Penn State destroy the Terps!
2895,Date of experience: September 2019,7-Sep-19,Big Ten,Maryland,4,Decent stadium for college event,Decent stadium for a college football game. Caution: metal benches with no seat backs.  Can be a long afternoon if visiting team seated in the sun!Concession options and pricing were stadium typical but did include some local flavor options. Rest rooms had no lines and were clean. If you walk from more remote parking lots note that the walk on the way in is mostly uphill. Staff was friendly and helpful.
2897,Date of experience: November 2018,8-Jan-19,Big Ten,Maryland,5,Awesome Experience,We attended the Ohio State - Maryland game at Capitol One field in November 2018.  The stadium offered great parking options and was easily accessible.  It did take quite a bit of time in traffic after the game - they could do a little better there.  The food and drinks in the stadium were good - and staff were knowledgeable when asked questions.
2898,Date of experience: November 2018,19-Nov-18,Big Ten,Maryland,4,Ohio State-Maryland game,"Great to visit another Big Ten stadium. It's a miniture Horseshoe. Cool food options (crabcake burger) that serves beer - although don't look for a big craft selection. Some Maryland craft, but not lots of options. Fans were great, sociable, able to talk about each team, and treated us well. I thought it was fantastic the University had shuttle buses from the Metro stop to the stadium. Then we sat in traffic on campus. Stadium experience is great and tailgate opportunities were nice. But the school needs to figure a better way to get people on and off campus - the stadium holds half of what Ohio Stadium does but it takes twice the time to get on and off campus. Requiring parking permits pre-purchased and pre-printed? Who does that analog thing now? Isn't there an app for that?"
2899,Date of experience: October 2018,14-Oct-18,Big Ten,Maryland,5,LOVED attending a football game here!!,We were very pleased with our first experience at this stadium.  The seating was excellent.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  Be aware....NO purses in the stadium!  We took our blanket so we could sit on it.  There were stadium cushions you could rent but they seemed to be a bit pricey ($20 per chair).  All in all....a great time.
2900,Date of experience: November 2017,4-May-18,Big Ten,Maryland,4,Great time,Went to the game  PSU VS Md. Had great seats that we fairly priced as well as the parking. Had to walk quite a ways but it's the same thing when we go to Penn State football's. It was awesome to have a large Penn STate crowd??since we are Penn State fans!
2902,Date of experience: November 2017,27-Nov-17,Big Ten,Maryland,1,Terrible venue,"The University has no idea how to manage large crowds.   Stadium entrances are mob scenes with undefined lines swarming to the front, with arguments breaking out all over as more than one person tried to cut to the front.  It took us 20 minutes to get inside the gate.  If you have not rented a stadium chair, don't be surprised if you have no place to sit.  The people who install the chairs do not pay close attention to the bench seat numbering.  I paid $600 for seats 1 through 5, only to find that stadium chairs for 6-15 had been pre-installed starting at seat 5.  The allotted spaces are tight enough as is without our having to squeeze five people into four spots."
2903,Date of experience: November 2017,24-Nov-17,Big Ten,Maryland,4,Very good time.,"Recently went to a football game and truly enjoyed the stadium.  Easy enough parking, easy access to stadium and great view of the field.  From the section we sat in it seemed very family friendly.  Would certainly go to another game at this stadium."
2904,Date of experience: November 2017,18-Nov-17,Big Ten,Maryland,3,Needs some work,Went to a football game here recently. Word of advice- bring or rent a stadium chair! There are no backs to these bleachers and sitting for 3 hours on a cold metal bleacher with no back would be impossible. The stadium is just not very impressive. The student fan support is seriously lacking. The students for the most part are gone by half time.
2905,Date of experience: November 2017,14-Nov-17,Big Ten,Maryland,3,"Nice little stadium, easy access",Nice stadium.  Our game was not close to capacity.  Maryland fans were pleasant.  Tailgating is in different lots a few blocks from the stadium.  All the seats seem pretty good.  Heard that from the top deck you can watch the game and see the Lincoln Memorial.
2906,Date of experience: November 2017,13-Nov-17,Big Ten,Maryland,3,Michigan-Maryland,"We went to the Maryland-Michigan game (Go Blue!).  Maryland has a terrible game-day atmosphere.  There were maybe 40,000 fans and I'd guess Michigan fans outnumbered Maryland fans 4-to-1.   The stadium has an odd design... they have three decks of bleachers on one side and a large tower of suites on the other, so the whole thing seems unbalanced.  The Maryland fans were pretty quiet and their student section was empty by half-time when Michigan led by four TDs.  The food selection was terrible.  Going off of prior reviews, I was looking for the Chessie and other options, but all we found was standard hot dogs, hamburgers, and pizza (typical stadium fare).  With that said, the Maryland fans we talked to were very polite and welcoming."
2907,Date of experience: October 2017,15-Oct-17,Big Ten,Maryland,5,"Terps lost to Northwestern, but good time",We go to a few games a year with my friend or my father in law.  Wife and I enjoyed our crab braided pretzel and pulled pork sandwich items.  Parking at Regent Garage is always helpful.  Sadly not too many students go to the games.
2908,Date of experience: September 2017,20-Sep-17,Big Ten,Maryland,3,Get the The 'Chessie',"Overall, the stadium is ok... biggest drawback is that going to UMD football games isn't all that popular... also, being in the DC area, loads of alumnus go to UMD games to see the away team. However, they are one of the few stadiums where you can purchase beer inside and they had some really Maryland food items, such as crab cakes, crab fries (fries with a lump crap meat + seasoning) and the 'Chessie' - a larger than normal soft pretzel with crab meat and cheese on top.  This pretzel is huge and can easily accommodate a 2-4 people.  It is a bit pricey but definitely worth it and should get it at least once.  There is also a smaller Chessie that is the size of a normal soft pretzel."
2909,Date of experience: October 2016,20-Apr-17,Big Ten,Maryland,3,An average stadium for a less than average team!,"Have been to Auburn , FSU, Clemson, Nebraska, U of Miami football venues. Even with facelift this stadium is sub-par. On small side of Big Ten, SEC, and ACC Stadiums ( with exception of Syracuse and Boston College)."
2911,Date of experience: November 2016,3-Dec-16,Big Ten,Maryland,4,OSU vs U of Maryland,"Easy in and easy out and a great place for tailgating a game. This a great stadium. Go and have a great time of Big Ten Football. Please work on getting faster access to the stadium. Lines going in were very slow. Sit at least 7 to 10 rows up to see the game. First row is one and half feet above field and if your not 6 feet tall and behind the team, you do not see."
2912,Date of experience: November 2016,23-Nov-16,Big Ten,Maryland,1,Terrible experience,"A few weeks ago myself and some friends attended the Maryland vs. Ohio State game. It is clear that Maryland does not have the capability to host a major big ten game. First of all, when arrived to the stadium about 10 mins before kick off, we were greeted with lines unlike I've ever seen at a sporting event. They did not have enough gates or staff to accommodate a full stadium. It's wasn't until the middle of the 2nd quarter that we were actually able to enter. Next, a lot of stadiums have different purse policies. I understand this and as a result brought a small purse (5x6inches). Prior to leaving the car I checked the rules and restrictions that were listed in my ticket. Nowhere did it mention, that purses of any kind with a strap are prohibited or anything about bags at all. I was forced to throw away a nice purse purchased in Italy. In the words of the ticket taker ""you can either throw your purse away, or miss the game because you'll never get back up here with these long lines"". So, I threw it away. Lastly, we got our tickets through the OSU Alumni Maryland Chapter, the seats were 5 rows from the field on the 50 yard line. We were so excited and headed down to our seats only to find someone else there. We explained they were our seats and asked them to move...but then they showed us their ticket and we had duplicates. Thinking this was odd I went to speak to a manager. When I reached her I saw that there were a TON of people with the same issue. It appears that Maryland sold duplicate tickets to a lot of people at high dollar amounts and then forced us to sit in worse seats because we had no other choice. To claim these were all fraud (which I know happens sometimes), isn't possible. One set of people who had duplicates bought directly from the university, others from alumni associations, etc. Needless to say it was the end of the 3rd quarter before we got sat in our much further back seats. We were given no accommodations, no refunds, nothing. Get it together Maryland...."
2913,Date of experience: November 2016,20-Nov-16,Big Ten,Maryland,3,So-so for a game,"I attended the Ohio State win at Capitol One field Maryland Stadium, sitting in the Upper Deck.  The sightlines up there were excellent.  All vantage points of the field were accessible.Getting up to the third deck was pretty standard for a large stadium as there are minimal elevators, but lots of stairs and ramps.  The food and drink offerings were fairly plentiful.The scoreboards need a major overhaul.  Not just are they small, they greatly lack necessary game information.  For instance, total yardage and other football stats are not displayed. The seating is also uncomfortable for most of the patrons.  Standard benches with no backs comprises most of the seating in the stadium.  While this is not uncommon for college stadiums, they still leave you a bit sore.Perhaps the best thing about the stadium is its location.  It is only a short shuttle ride from the Metro.  It sets up perfectly to spend a great weekend road-trip in DC and to attend a game, all without the need for a car near campus."
2914,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Nov-16,Big Ten,Maryland,5,Small stadium but great for watching football games,"My friends and I were checking out the Ohio State University Maryland football game the stadium is small but very quite easy to maneuver easy to get around not a bad college stadium however the Jumbotron's need to be update very old and not high definition, Plus they sell beer and I'm not a fan of beer at a college stadium. Call me old-fashioned."
2915,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Nov-16,Big Ten,Maryland,3,Pretty nice,"As big 10 stadiums go, this was small and aged. However, big bucks now spent building a world class practice center next door. I foresee a new stadium project down the road.College employees were cordial, helpful, good examples of college kids. The non college employees- not so much. Pretty much a TOLL TAKER attitude- not a good example for anybody.Food was very good, bathrooms ok, sat in upper deck but view was fine from row k. Worth the money?? Barely"
2916,Date of experience: October 2016,6-Nov-16,Big Ten,Maryland,4,Maryland football game,"Attended at University of Maryland football game. Excellent stadium with affordable prices and a central location. Also, a family friendly environment."
2917,Date of experience: October 2016,25-Oct-16,Big Ten,Maryland,3,Older Stadium,"Capital One Field at Maryland Stadium is located near the center of the University of Maryland campus.  The stadium was built in 1950 and currently seats about 55,000 fans.  The Campus is located in College Park, Maryland which is about 16 miles north of downtown Washington DC. We purchased advance parking tickets for $17 so parking was not a problem (a campus map led us right to the correct parking ramp). I am not sure where you park if you do not buy an on-line advance parking pass.I went to the Maryland versus Minnesota football game with my wife on a Saturday morning in mid-October and enjoyed the game but thought the older stadium was just OK.  We sat in the visitor section near the goal line and the sight lines were good. The visitor side is the sunny side and we were in full sun the entire game (the home side was shady). We arrived about an hour and 15 minutes early and there was absolutely no one in line to get in. Seating was very cramped and the seat back I rented hit the knees of the guy sitting behind me.  The inside of the stadium seemed a little run down but the employees were very friendly and the food prices were really cheap.  For lunch we both had awesome $6 hot dogs.   These were the best stadium hot dogs I have ever eaten (I was amazed how good they were).Overall I was not really impressed with this old stadium but enjoyed the game and enjoyed the entire game day experience (plus my Minnesota Gophers were victorious)."
2918,Date of experience: October 2016,15-Oct-16,Big Ten,Maryland,1,Wish I would have waited for a real game to review,"I stand by what I said in my last review, it's a fairly decent stadium for its age, but unfortunately it's run poorly by unfriendly people. I get to the stadium and look for the ""P2"" lot which I knew was a good distance away. I asked two parking attendants and they said they were unsure where ""P2"" was and more or less gave me get lost feeling. Unsure where to go and not getting any help I went back to the main road and searched for Baltimore pike which I remembered had access to the campus. After spending an hour lost in heavy traffic and aggressive drivers I finally find Baltimore pike and despite it being half time decided to try one more time. Nope the two campus entrances from Baltimore pike are gated off. It was then I decided it was time to go. Never have I've seen entrances closed on game day and I've been to several stadiums including this one for the spring game. If closing campus gates and hiring unhelpful workers flies around here than forget it. Enjoy your university Maryland because I will never be back."
2922,Date of experience: October 2022,10-Oct-22,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Must See Stadium,"If you??re a football fan, this is a must see stadium. It??s truly a work of art and the atmosphere for games is unmatched. 10/10, will be back!"
2923,Date of experience: September 2022,28-Sep-22,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Just an awesome experience!!,"So much fun!  First, the tailgate.  Then, the walk to the stadium with 100's of people in maize and blue - so much school spirit!  Then the stadium.  Huge.  All seats are amazing.  Super close to your neighbors but everyone is so happy and friendly.  Go Blue!  Wolverines are amazing to watch.  LOVED the doggo catching the frisbee during time outs!  If you are a sports fan, or even if you are not, you should experience the big house at some point in your life.  Not to be missed!!"
2924,Date of experience: September 2022,16-Sep-22,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Electrifying Experience,"Our first trip to see the ??Big House??. The game was delayed for an hour because of lightning. Folks, if you never been GO!! This is an amazing stadium!! Yes, it is the Big House. Do get there early. Traffic is difficult. We took a city bus.Took us over an hour to get to stadium even though we were staying 10 minutes away. We used Uber to return to hotel. We had to walk East about 4 blocks then North 4 blocks to get an Uber. This is due to the roads they close. It was a blast!! No , I wasn??t rooting for Michigan, their fans were kind to us.Guessing if you are a Michigan State or  Ohio State might be a different response. We were there for the Hawaii game. The place was electric!! It was hard not to get swept up in the excitement. First big time football my grandson has seen. He is 10 and a Michigan fan so he really got into the cheering ect."
2925,Date of experience: September 2022,6-Sep-22,Big Ten,Michigan ,3,Underwhelmed,"Came to experience the 'magic' of the Big House but ..meh, very cramped seating, poor sound system, no beer, but Wolverine energy and history in the plus column."
2926,Date of experience: September 2022,4-Sep-22,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Legendary,Phenomenal place to watch a football game. Needs to be on any college fan??s bucket list. Full of history & what an atmosphere.
2927,Date of experience: October 2021,12-Dec-21,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,First visit to Big House!,"Came here all the way from Florida to watch the NW vs Michigan game.  The weather was prefect football weather in the upper 50s, low 60s.  The crowd as announced at 109,500.  It was my first time in the Big House and it was an awesome experience.  Our seats were ok and the crowd was really into the game.  The concessions were a little expensive and not the best quality.One huge complaint is there is no alcohol sales at this stadium.  UM needs to get with the times and open up that revenue stream.Michigan had a big win and the band and crowd were into the game all 4 quarters.  This is a top 10 location in the nation to watch a college football game!"
2928,Date of experience: November 2021,27-Nov-21,Big Ten,Michigan ,1,Stadium actually worse than football team,"Poorly designed stadium makes it especially difficult to view the game if your short. Tightest seats in B1G.  Warm cardboard and motor oil are better than the pretzels and hot chocolate. Many Home fans are unwelcoming, vulgar, and shockingly profane.  if you must go don??t bring your kids.  Finally,  Anne Arbor weather can make you wish you were home.Stay home or visit another B1G stadium."
2929,Date of experience: November 2021,27-Nov-21,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Iconic Stadium,"This is one of the best places to see a college football game. The walk to the Stadium is alone almost worth the price of admission. It primarily has bleacher seating, and the food and beverage options are pretty limited.  But it gets loud and the atmosphere can be absolutely electric, never more so than after today??s Michigan upset of Ohio State.Hail!"
2930,Date of experience: October 2021,21-Oct-21,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The largest stadium in the United States,"The first time I visited Michigan Stadium was in 1960 when the Elliott brothers, Pete and Bump, coached against each other for the first time. I was sports editor of the Daily Illini. Michigan won 8-7 before a capacity crowd of 101,001. Afterward, I walked to a nearby railroad station and boarded a train to Chicago. Modeled after the Yale Bowl, Michigan Stadium was built in 1927 with a capacity of 72,000. Football coach Fielding Yost designed the stadium so it could be expanded to seat up to 200,000 fans. Today, The Big House, as it commonly known, has a capacity of 107,601, is the largest stadium in the United States and the Western Hemisphere and the third largest stadium in the world. Every home game since November 8, 1975 has drawn a crowd in excess of 100,000, a streak of more than 200 contests. On September 13, 2013, Michigan/Notre Dame attracted 115,109, a record for a college football game since 1948. In 2014, a Manchester United/Real Madrid soccer match drew 109,318, a record crowd for a soccer match in the United States. Since my visit in 1960, when the grounds surrounding the stadium were virtually vacant, Crisler Center has been constructed along with East Stadium Boulevard and many parking lots. Six retired football jerseys representing eight Michigan football greats are displayed on the Bill Martin Concourse located on the upper east side of the stadium--Albert, Alvin and Whitey Wistert, Desmond Howard, Bennie Oosterbaan, Gerald Ford, Ron Kramer and Tom Harmon."
2931,Date of experience: September 2021,25-Sep-21,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Fabulous,"First time here for a football game. People / staff were so nice. The stadium is clean, easy to get around. Will return."
2932,Date of experience: September 2021,20-Sep-21,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,So freaking big,Impossibly huge. Wow. Must actually go to a game not that tickets would ever be available or parking easy to find ... it's awe inspiring
2933,Date of experience: September 2021,9-Sep-21,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Victors Valiant in The Big House,"I??ve been waiting a long time to go to The Big House and it was well worth it especially to go for the Season Opener after last years shut down. It blows away any NFL game that I??ve been to and I??m from Buffalo! The Bills have some of the most iconic fans and tailgating but the tailgating experience on the golf course and seeing all the team pride, getting there 5 hours before kickoff after we drove 6 hours to Michigan, was incredible. Walking up to the stadium was awesome. It??s not as daunting from outside. It??s a beautiful stadium from outside though. Inside the stadium I will admit that seating is tight. They could fit 90,000 people on comfortably but I totally get wanting over 100,000 fans at what was the 294th consecutive game. The atmosphere in the stadium was pure excitement from the moment we walked down from the top to our 15th row seats on the corner. The Michigan Fight Song played by the Michigan Marching Band only added to the electricity as we clapped and pumped our fists with 109,000 others. You cannot beat the feeling of being at a big time college football game and no place better than at The Big House"
2934,Date of experience: January 2020,14-Dec-20,Big Ten,Michigan ,2,NO!!!!,"Don't buy the hype.  The ""Big House"", as it has been called, is really just a ""Big Hole in the Ground"".  As you approach the stadium, it is unimpressive and un-inspiring.  because it is a hole in the ground, there is very little visible above ground.  No soaring stands or impressive murals (Like Spartan Stadium).  Horrible sight lines; you are far away from the field.  And talk about NO atmosphere.  I was there for an OSU game (the biggest rival), and the place was quiet  like church on a Tuesday.  Then, talk about LEAVING?!?!?!  There is only one exit per aisle (which run all the way down the entire length of the stadium.  There are no tiers), so it takes 15 minutes just to get out of the dump.  There is no parking anywhere.  And good like trying to drive home.  You'll be stuck in AA for 2 hrs."
2935,Date of experience: October 2020,3-Nov-20,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Huge,This stadium is really big.  We were here for a campus visit and liked the stadium a lot.  It??s within walking distance of the main campus and seems like a real draw for the school.
2936,Date of experience: September 2019,13-Apr-20,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,"Go Blue, see a great football game :D","This Stadium is the LARGEST in the country. Each Saturday home game, upon arrival, you feel like your part of one big family as you set up your tents and bring out the food/drinks. I love the atmosphere(ok, except for when it's sleeting, raining or snowing), the 2 new MONSTER video screens. the band/game stadium or PA Announcer is Carl Grapentine. The have all the necessities; bathrooms, concession stands, souvenir shops and of course, a wonderful field to play football on. except for the weather, what's there to hate. All staff will be happy to assist you. So get out, buy a ticket a see this wonderful piece of Ann Arbor sports heaven. Go BlueMike."

Ok - the result was awful, but the experience was second to none. The stadium is absolutely incredible, the atmosphere is breathtaking and it's everything you expect it to be and more. The place just exudes history and authority.The food and coffee outlets are great too, really friendly and efficient staff. A great big tick on the bucket list for me, and one I wouldn't mind ticking off again somewhere down the line!"
2942,Date of experience: November 2019,30-Nov-19,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Cannot Beat The Buckeyes,"This is an iconic football stadium offering almost no amenities: It is primarily bleacher seating, the aisles are narrow, making movement tough during the game, and the food and beverage choices are pretty bad. Of course, none of that would matter if we could knockoff Ohio State. Sadly, of course, we cannot seem to get that done."

Have to fight your way to your seat and prepared to get jostled and bumped continually.  Once you get to your seat,  things are much better. Parking is a nightmare. Chaos rules the day.  Everyone seems to be used to it,  but it doesn't have to be this way. Game was great,  crowd was great,  over all a good experience but it tests your patience."

Tight fit and hard to see for smaller people. Older stadium and could use better food experience. Easy commuter buses from local hotel made it easy to get to the stadium. People were kind and friendly. Would go back for sure.
2949,Date of experience: October 2019,16-Oct-19,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Like being back in the Yale Bowl,"As new comers, friends gave us their season ticket, (but I paid 40$ to park) and we quickly realized by their comments those around us knew we were new to their space, and someone behind me pushing her knee into me and the other man beside me  wiggling to gain more space and I felt like I was trapped on an airplane but I was taken in by the flying airplanes above tailing their kites.  Iit was an experience, made more memorable by  one of the sea gulls flying way above who dropped me a present on my shoulder, much to the amusement of the rabid fans around me. Michigan Won and I want another ticket!"

2954,Date of experience: September 2019,3-Oct-19,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor,We went to see the Army vs Michigan game.  Great game and great venue!  This is a beautiful stadium located in the heart of Ann Arbor.  I would recommend going here at least once in your lifetime.
2955,Date of experience: September 2019,3-Oct-19,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Big Time at the Big House,"Traveled all the way from California to the Big House and it was quite an experience.  It does not feel like there are 110k people here.  It works like a well-oiled machine.  Great atmosphere.  Make sure to visit the store to pick up all your Michigan souvenir and merchandise.  Take the Football Shuttle Bus to the stadium - $6 round trip from most local hotels to the stadium. On the way you'll see street-filled fans, cars, EZ-ups for what feels like an all-city tailgate party."

2957,Date of experience: August 2019,25-Sep-19,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Made It to the Big House,"My husband is from Detroit and a HUG fan of University Of Michigan but  we live in Columubus Ohio, home of the Buckeyes.  I have taken him (under protest) to THE Ohio State University game /events over the 31 years of marriage  but he   had never ever been to UOM football stadium for a game. This was his Fathers Day gift, tickets to the 2019 opening home game in the BIG HOUSE.  We had seats in Section 20, row 12, seats 23 & 24 and it was magical and exciting.. The stadium was as grand as we imaged but you better be in good shape to navigate the stadium steps. Wolverine fans are ""off the hook"" , 80%-85% fans are standing watching the game, thank goodness for the big TV screens .  It was a great weekend in Ann Arbor"
2958,Date of experience: August 2019,16-Sep-19,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,??Big House?? amazing,The stadium is very crowded as expected. If you want anything you should buy it when you walk past venders before entering stadium. The Regular stadium seats were okay with the help of a basic M cushion. Seat space is tight. The steps inside the stadium are high compared to standard steps so if you have a spine or knee disorder it is more challenging. Advise get there early or right before the game starts. Use the restroom before the game or you will have a long line to wait in. Venders start closing up in the third quarter.Everyone was so so Polite that??s what Michigan??s all about.

2960,Date of experience: August 2019,5-Sep-19,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Michigan football game,It was a blast! The stadium was massive. There were so much to see inside. There were plenty of bathrooms and places to get food. Parking is best thought of ahead of time. It was first time to the stadium to see a game and I was very impressed. I would gladly go again. Staff working the game were helpful and friendly.
2961,Date of experience: September 2019,2-Sep-19,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Awesome environment,"Love going to the big house. First night game for me, really cool with all the lights. Tailgating at the golf course is a must do"
2962,Date of experience: August 2019,26-Aug-19,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Wow!,"So much fun! The stadium is well run and clean. Some of the seats are a bit small, but it isn't a problem for most people. The stands were electric, great place for older kids."
2963,Date of experience: November 2018,18-Aug-19,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Stadium improvements,This was the first time I was in the general stands since the remodel.  The biggest improvements I saw were with the bathrooms (no more banks of porta-johns!).  There is a bit of a confusing layout between levels in the stadium.  It's a good sports venue....even though it is the U of M stadium.  :(.
2964,Date of experience: August 2019,14-Aug-19,Big Ten,Michigan ,3,Barca game.,Stadium was nice and big. Problem was that since they were bench seats we were crammed in. The kid behind me couldn't see so I was crouched over so he could. They were selling beers for 10 dollars which seemed extremely steep. I had one and done on that front saving it for the bars after. Not sure if it was the stadium or the club but they were definitely price gouging on souvenirs too. I've been to the stadium in barcelona and they dont charge anywhere near 37 dollars for a scarf.
2965,Date of experience: August 2019,11-Aug-19,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Great experience!,"Watched the iconic Barcelona and Napoli La Liga series game here! The stadiumI have been told has a capacity of 115k people. It??s huge clean with different entry points or gates that move from left to right .The volunteers here are kind and friendly folks who are extremely helpful too. Lots of food and drink stalls inside. Food is expensive though, drinks at $7 and pretzels @$6. You are not allowed Any kind of bags inside the stadium not even small purses and like all stadiums no food or water is allowed inside.Sections in the 20s are shaded due to the concrete glass viewing areas - those in the 30s are not. Entry and exit were well coordinated in spite of the crowds. Parking available onsite But we parked on street about 3/4 blocks towards the downtown area at $1.90 per hour for Monday to Saturday 8-6pm. This  area around Main Street is famous for its patio restaurant that were packed during the weekend! Lovely place Ann Arbor and the Michigan stadium only adds to the charm of this place."
2966,Date of experience: November 2018,7-Aug-19,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The second biggest stadium in the world!!!,"University of Michigan Stadium is the second largest in the world, only after the massive football stadium in North Korea. It is very well maintained, clean and organized, especially considering the record number of games with more than 100,000 people in attendance. It is a magical experience to seat at a game and experience the massive crowd cheering for Michigan while being at the same time so respectful and civil in their behavior."
2967,Date of experience: August 2019,6-Aug-19,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House,"Is the biggest and best stadium in the land. And has Michigan football!! The fans, the cheerleaders and especially the band make it the best place to be in America on a Saturday."
2969,Date of experience: October 2018,30-Jul-19,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,A must see in the A2 area!,"Even if you can't get inside, it's still a great spot to check out. Go see a game and you'll be amazed! All the fans make for a very entertaining event, even outside the actual game happening down on the field. Get cozy, as they pack you in, and enjoy some college football."
2972,Date of experience: September 2018,11-Jul-19,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Must-see,"If you??re any kind of a college football fan, you need to score a ticket for at least one game here. Sitting with 110,000 + fellow fans is a fun afternoon that??s not to be missed. Wolverine fans are the epitome of dedication when it comes to support, and it shows. Let yourself become immersed in the atmosphere! Get your tickets well in advance (Stubhub is a good venue for finding them), because every game sells out."
2973,Date of experience: November 2018,17-May-19,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Awesome,"I went there with a friend and we had a great time. Perfect place to watch a game. I suggest bussing or walking to the game though, because parking is sparse and expensive."
2975,Date of experience: November 2018,31-Mar-19,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Best Stadium in the World,"Don??t miss an opportunity to go to the big house - and it doesn??t matter where you sit.  All the seats are great and there are no obstructed view seats.  Enjoy a football game, tailgate before (and after), order food from Zingerman??s and pick it up on the way!  Nothing better than a football Saturday in Ann Arbor! Go Blue!"
2976,Date of experience: October 2018,24-Mar-19,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Great fun in the fall,"We bike there from our house. You could tail gate--it looks like great fun. Games this past season--2018 were so much fun because UM always won in a rather joyful way. The only problems we saw were the enthusiasm of the crowd--nobody sits down! and my husband has a slipped disk so standing is hard, and the price of food is really outrageous. But it is a day event and great fun."
2977,Date of experience: November 2018,19-Feb-19,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Football game ambiance  beyond compare,There is nothing to compare with attending a football game at the Big House.   It is well managed and safety is clearly enforced.
2978,Date of experience: September 2018,12-Feb-19,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Nothing Like It,"Game On!  If your team plays Michigan, go!  No matter the odds of winning, it is an experience to share.  The fans were great.  The tailgate was lively. Make a day of it!"
2979,Date of experience: September 2018,10-Feb-19,Big Ten,Michigan ,2,Cramped,"Look, I'm not a football person, but we live a mile away so I thought we should give it a try. I was excited to see ""the biggest stadium in America"" - it is no such thing. It can seat more people because these are not seats, they are benches.  The entire side of your body will be touching people next to you.  Do not expect to be able to get up and out whenever you want.  This is nothing like going to a professional stadium.  The food was pretty good, for stadium food, which I generally quite like, but I was so uncomfortable throughout the whole experience that I can't say I'll ever go back."
2980,Date of experience: September 2018,7-Feb-19,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,It Doesn't Feel Like 100K People,"We enjoyed the hospitality we experienced as fans of the away team from fans while tailgating and inside the stadium. When I saw we were in Row 88 on my ticket, I expected I'd need a telescope, but that was not the case. I don't know how the away team seats way up in the corner can still feel like good seats, but they do. It doesn't feel like there are 100K+ --- which is a good thing. It's well designed and if our seats were still good seats, there must not be a bad seat in the Big House."
2981,Date of experience: October 2018,26-Jan-19,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Wonderful experience for a game,"It's always nice to spend time in Ann Arbor, and hard to skip the campus while in town.  The stadium is a great place for a college football game, lots of excitement, food, tailgating.... we parked at the Park and Ride lot at 23 and Geddes road and to bus into stadium.  Great way to avoid parking issues and trying to get out after game."
2982,Date of experience: January 2019,22-Jan-19,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Love Michigan,I love the atmosphere and the team. I come here every year and I never had a problem with the service.
2984,Date of experience: October 2018,31-Dec-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,1,Garbage,"Fan base is trash. Stadium is trash. Team is overrated considering they haven't even beat Ohio State in a decade. Yet, the fan base has an air of smugness about them that's completely unfounded. Would never go back. Rudest fans in all of NCAA in all my years of traveling for road games."
2985,Date of experience: August 2018,17-Dec-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The best stadium in the world,"I've been to all seven continents, all the stadiums in the big ten I even marched in the marching band at Michigan.  I can say unequivocally this is one of the most magical places you could ever spend a Saturday afternoon on the fall."
2986,Date of experience: September 2018,11-Dec-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House!,"No better place to spend a saturday in the fall then with 110,000 other Michigan fans.  Add the odd Soccer game or Hockey game and it just doesn't get better than that.Major improvements have been made to concourse in the past 5 years which have helped with the game day experience.  Just remember, if you want to get some food at half time, it might be good to leave at the beginning of the 2nd quarter to get your food and avoid the lines."
2987,Date of experience: October 2018,10-Dec-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Gameday,"Not a bad seat in the big house. I've been to many college and professional stadiums across the country, and none of them have the history and atmosphere like the big house provides."

I have been missing this since moving from Europe.Here the crowd cheers, sings and enjoys the game.For the first time I had to stand almost for the entire game which is what it should always be. #bighouse"
2989,Date of experience: November 2018,21-Nov-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Take the time and enjoy a spectacle of the highest order...a Michigan home game!,"It's the home of the Michigan Wolverines football team, but it's so much more on gameday. I first went to the Big House when I was about 10, then again when I was about 16, again when I was in my 20's when my alma mater played there, and then again in 2016 and 2018. The great thing about this visit was that Michigan was #4 in the country, making for the most raucous crowd since my second visit a couple decades ago. This is impressive just as a stadium if you get the chance to visit on a non-game day. But gameday is awesome! Get there early to tailgate. I prefer the golf course as my tailgate base, but due to weather the golf course was not available for this game. Instead we parked just down Ann Arbor/Saline Road and walked to the stadium. The tailgate on the golf course or at Pioneer HS are well worth stopping through just to see the way that UM fans do it. They take this stuff seriously...multiple tents together with walls, tv's food of all kinds, inflatables, RVs with the Jordan jumpman logo and the Michigan helmet design. It's like a huge party that lasts 5 hours before you enter. As you approach the stadium, there's a big ""M Den"" tent with all the Michigan gear you could want. There's more inside the stadium so don't feel like you need to buy outside, but it's there if you need it. Once you get inside, and Michigan is in their home blues with those beautiful helmets...what a sight. Make sure you get in early enough to see the Michigan band play the most famous college fight song in the world, ""The Victors"". Watch the team run onto the field and hit the banner. Watch Harbaugh during warm-ups doing Harbaugh things. The crowd was on its feet the whole game in our section. 3rd down was almost as loud as it can get in an open air stadium. 110,000+ go here every home game, and they were at full throat. My kids were loving watching the student section do their thing while the band played. Even my daughter, who's not a big football fan had a great time. It is a true spectacle. One more thing for us, as we have a celiac disease in our family...they actually have some good gluten free stuff! The gluten free food stand is by section 40, so it's a great place to get your tickets if you have a person who needs it."
2990,Date of experience: November 2018,20-Nov-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Pro-Tips for Visiting the Awesome Big House,"The Big House is a must-visit site for any sports fan, and not just Michigan fans.  Here are pro-tips.  The place is huge.  If you have any ambulatory concerns plan ahead.  It looks like they have plenty of assistance if you have issues, but you'll want to confirm.  The crowd getting in and out is massive and moves fast.  If you are unsure of where you are going then go early.  The seating arrangements are well marked.  Parking appears to be at a premium, so please plan ahead there too.  I did not see any big lots.  People take a lot of public transit then walk to the game.  Food inside did not seem that plentiful.  Plan ahead with water and food.  Bottom line, a Michigan game day is a huge event so go prepared.  Also, if it's cold, wear and extra layer.  we sat up pretty high and it got cold when the wind blows."
2991,Date of experience: November 2018,19-Nov-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Next Best Event Behind Christmas Morning,"If you are a Wolverines Fan, then this not only NEEDS to be on your ??Bucket List?? but should be one of the first things checked off of your list! There is not a Bad Seat in the House, bathrooms were clean and the lines moved quickly! If you are attending for the first time, I highly suggest that you google the band schedule, which typically arrive 25 minutes before kickoff, and watch them from outside the stadium, as they march up the street and perform again before entering the tunnel. You will need to then race to your seat, so that you do not miss the ??PRICELESS?? performance of a lifetime out on the field. And shame on you if you miss the team entering the field and slapping the banner! A MUST DO!!!!"
2992,Date of experience: September 2018,16-Nov-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Awesome Stadium and Friendly Fans,"I came up to Ann Arbor in September to see the football game between Nebraska and Michigan (which wasn't the greatest game to see), but the stadium is very cool. It's so big, and it's interesting to me that it's built into the ground. The fans were friendly, I never had any problems even though I was cheering for the visitors."
2993,Date of experience: November 2018,15-Nov-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Amazing,Best football stadium always a pleasure to be here. Just one of the best traditions in college football
2994,Date of experience: October 2018,13-Nov-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,A Must See,"We went to our first Michigan football game this season and really enjoyed the experience.  There are over 110,000 fans in the stadium, which allows for a fun, crazy environment to watch a football game.  The amount of tunnels in relationship to the amount of seats in small, so there were both long waits to get into the game and leave the game.  I'm sure this is why they can cram so many people in.  One thing that was very confusing was that we had seat numbers 3 and 4, but were smack dab in the middle of a VERY long row!!!  This made absolutely zero sense and made it so difficult to get up to use the bathroom!  However, Michigan stadium is one that everyone should experience.  Great ambiance for a college football game!!"
2995,Date of experience: December 2017,13-Nov-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Loud and fun atmosphere,Gifted a trip to a Michigan game for my Wolverine fan boyfriend and it was awesome. The seats were awesome for a reasonable price. The atmosphere is loud and fun!
2996,Date of experience: November 2018,11-Nov-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,1,Full of piggish fans,"My family was part of a volunteer program called ??stadium cleanup?? for four years.  I fear Michigan fans are probably no worse than other consumers of mass tribal entertainment, but they are certainly no better.  Not much sense of community, respect for others or the environment.  Ugh!"
2997,Date of experience: November 2018,10-Nov-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,another bucket list item checked off,"I recently attended a Penn State- Michigan game here.  The stadium is huge!  The fans inside the stadium were very nice to me as I was dressed in Penn State white.  As I exited the row I was sitting in to head back to the bus a little early, the Michigan fan on the end of the row shook my hand and thanked me for visiting the ""big house"".  The fans around me were nice.  Michigan routed PSU in this game and I just have to wonder how nice they would have been to me had the tables been turned.  The fans outside of the stadium however were a different breed as I headed into the game.  A majority of them yelling profanities and talking about this being a ""revenge"" game.  If it takes some trumped up slights or perceived iniquities to fire up your team or fan base, then so be it.  Anywho, back to the stadium itself.  I did not visit the stadium prior to the ""recent"" refurbishing.  The food stands and bathrooms were fine.  There are not enough bathrooms of course to handle all of the fans.  I think this is true in just about every stadium in the country.  The views from every seat that I could sit in before the game started are about the same, as the stadium is one huge bowl with giant press box/suites above the bowl on both sidelines.  Make sure you check out the list of prohibitive items before you enter the stadium.  Parking can be hard to find.  Most of the homeowners in the area allow you to park in the driveways, yards, streets, etc. for a fee of course.  Despite the outcome of the game, I had a great time and would go again."
2998,Date of experience: September 2018,7-Nov-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,"""The Big House"" Home of Champions","I received tickets to the Maize Out Michigan vs. Nebraska game as a surprise from my son. Maize was the apparel theme for this game! Yea we won 56 to 10! Only down side was missing the NFF Hall of Fame On-Campus Salute of my favorite Wolverine Charles Woodson, while at will call picking up our tickets. The Big House is the largest stadium in the country and the second largest in the world. One hundred eleven thousand and thirty seven adoring Michigan fans were in attendance to witness the match up between our beloved Wolverines and the Cornhuskers. I would advice browsing the division of public safety for what items you can and cannot bring into the stadium, as well as their policies on prohibited behavior. Parking is never an issue as surrounding area residents allow fans to park on their property. We found parking a couple blocks away for $20.00 in a resident??s driveway. Glad we took his advice on the facility bag check policy, otherwise my hubby and I would have been returning to our car. Check out the website for in depth information to assist with your fan experience. For fans needing accessible parking make sure to check out their parking & courtesy shuffle info. The stadium has fourteen elevators to service the suite & club level fans, as well as guest needing assistance. You can pick up your fan gear before or after the game or while visiting the concessions. I noticed some seats had really comfy cushions, turns out those can be leased per season. You can direct any questions and concerns to the stadium guest services. The stadium, restrooms and grounds were well maintained. The Michigan stadium is awesome, I had a ball being among the sea of Maize wearing fans cheering our Wolverines on to victory."
2999,Date of experience: September 2018,7-Nov-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The big house,"This is a must see for any football fan. Easy to get in and easy to leave, even with 110,000 people there!"
3000,Date of experience: November 2018,7-Nov-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,1,JUST BECAUSE IT'S THE BIGGEST DOESN'T MEAN IT'S THE BEST!,"I've watched games in The Big House for nearly 50 years, and have seen it get bigger and bigger but ""worser and worser"" at the same time.  So now it has 109,901 seats and can squeeze 115,000 in but that makes it all the harder to get squeezed through the tunnels and into your seat-- if you can find it without being trampled.  I went to my last game this past Saturday, against Penn State.  It took a half an hour to get to our seats (5 of us) once we were inside the gate.  BTW, beware what you try to take in.  Leave your purses, canteens, water bottles, umbrellas and others packages in your car.  Once you are in the gates they make you open your jackets and if they find any such prohibited items you have leave the line and check them in a room where they'll hold them without charge until you leave.  That only adds to your discomfort.  You can't even bring in a binocular case-- the binoculars yes, but the case no.  Once inside the noise from 100,000 fans is overwhelming, and then the University plays horribly loud music from dreadfully bad speakers which nearly blast you out of the place.  During the game the U posts messages on the giant moving screens at both ends of the field ordering the fans to make NOISE, which flashed on and off when the opposing team has possession and is lining up, which usually prevents the players from hearing the QB's calling out the signals and results in a delay of game penalty against the visiting team.  Just not fair but then football is not a fair game played in a fair stadium with fair fans.  When you need to find an available restroom in the Big House good luck to you.  ""Available"" is the operative word here.  There are some inside the stadium but always a line.  Then, just outside the stadium but within the gates are a bunch of Porta-Johns and a few restrooms in outlying buildings.  I kid you not, but the lines can have more than a hundred people waiting for a single lavatory.  The University needs to add about a thousand permanent restrooms scattered about the stadium.  Many waiting fans report soiling themselves or peeing their pants and some leave the gates to find distant Porta-Johns and then can't back through the gates.  There are cops everywhere but they are not very accommodating and take the duty just for the overtime.  One other thing needs to be said here:  The U has very few receptacles for trash or recycling.  After the game you will discover tons of garbage, trash and litter in the stadium itself, inside and outside the gates and leading into the city streets.  It will be on the ground, on bollards, barricades, and barrels, and on every level surface."

There was a military fly over and then at beginning of 3rd period the pilots came out and got standing ovationSo much fun and positive energy"
3002,Date of experience: November 2018,6-Nov-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Fun game,We had a great time visiting The Big House when our team visited Michigan. All the home fans around us were nice. We had a good meal in the stadium and really enjoyed our time there.

His father passed away several years ago. Since we live in Florida my husband rarely has the chance to go to a game. So for his birthday present I got tickets, flight and hotel. My husband is a true fan! He??s crazy just watching on television. So to see him at the game was a blast. We had great seats, Section 3, Row 5. The fact that Michigan best Penn State 42 to 7 made it even better. The stadium is huge and this experience was was awesome. Go Blue!????????"

I've been to alot of college games but, you cant visit campuses and not visit The Big House!!"
3006,Date of experience: October 2018,31-Oct-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,nice stadium,Good stadium but the seating is pretty uncomfortable.  There is a reason people are standing when you see them on tv.  It is in the heart of Ann Arbor.
3007,Date of experience: October 2018,30-Oct-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Fantastic Atmosphere,"I came to Michigan Stadium for my first college football game where the Wolverines played WMU. The game was one sided but the fanfare was some of the best I've ever seen with the band and Cheerleaders. Seats however are uncomfortable as they are benches but is does mean they can fit 110,000 people in the stadium. Also there didn't seem to be any alcohol sold. In terms of tips I would recommend parking and getting the bus at the parking near the stadium is very expensive, going up to $50 for the official parking. Wi-Fi is avaliable but the signal is bad making it unusable at times."
3008,Date of experience: October 2018,27-Oct-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House -  No better place to watch football!,"Loved being back in Ann Arbor and watching Michigan defeat Wisconsin.   If you haven't attended in a while, be warned that no bags of any kind are allowed in the stadium, including ladies' purses and backpacks.  Umbrellas are also prohibited, but you can purchase stylish UM rain ponchos at M-Den."

The Michigan football team is the real deal and on that night, Wisconsin was not.  But this review is about the stadium.  I was somewhat surprised at the stadium...it is a huge facility but I was disappointed in a number of  things.  The sound system was terribly undersized compared to the facility....we were in the end zone and the sound from the speaker system did not carry well.  I know the facility has been around a long time but the layout of the concourse and the entrances just do not do justice to the ""Big House.""  Everything seemed more crowded than it needed to be and the layout was not consistent with traffic flow.  They had large restroom facilities available but were not adequately marked as most directional signs were directed to smaller ones. Despite the mild disappointment with the facility, the MIchigan fans and the ushers were helpful and friendly (otherwise we would have never found the larger restrooms)."
3013,Date of experience: October 2018,17-Oct-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Put this on your bucket list!,"People come for the game, not the accommodations. But the chance to see a game at the storied Big House is a must.Get there early to find your seats because it can be really hard to find when the place is full up (111,360 fans at our game). The bleacher seating allows for 15.5"" of butt space- that's it so expect to be close and friendly with your neighbors. Bring a seat pad (season ticket holders can lease them) and expect to get up to cheer a lot or let someone through. No alcohol means much fewer bathroom trips. The stadium staff is extremely friendly and go out of their way to help. One of the security personnel offered to take our picture for us. Some of the ushers have been doing games for 50+ years!I did not buy any food here, but I do know that their Cottage Inn pizza is amazing. People rent out parking spaces on their lawns in the nearby neighborhoods for $20. Plan your escape route and back up escape route early. Data networks are jammed and you probably will not be able to get your Waze or other apps working to help you find a way out. We sat up high in section 18. It was a great view of the field and when the game ended, we went up to the top where there bathrooms and stairways to take us directly down and out of the stadium. Not many people knew about this. Just don't forget to pack your patience."
3014,Date of experience: August 2018,16-Oct-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House!,"If you are in Ann Arbor at least drive by the Big house. From the outside it looks like an average football stadium,  it when you walk in the gates and look down you will get a surprise. The magnitude is jaw dropping. There is an energy and excitement I. The air even if it is not game day. This is the largest college football stadium. Go check it out."
3015,Date of experience: October 2018,15-Oct-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,A once in a lifetime experience,We sat 6th row up at the 25 yard line. Was an amazing experience seeing everyone in yellow and blue cheering. Just remember not to bring a bag or else you will need to check it which is very inconvenient. We will definitely be returning for another game.
3016,Date of experience: October 2018,15-Oct-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Great Experience - Go Blue,"A US college football game is something that everyone (who enjoys sports) should experience at least once in their lifetime.  It is a unique American experience.  Seeing a football game at Michigan Stadium with 115,000 of your closest friends is incredible.  The stadium is first class.  Lot of concessions stands and food (no booze).  The lack of alcohol is not an issue bc most people spend the entire day drinking and already arrive to the game very happy.  This is an experience not to be missed."
3017,Date of experience: October 2018,15-Oct-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Great!,"What a great place to see a game. There are a few things that are an issue if you are going to have 100,000+. The lines to get in and out are crazy, so are the lines for food."
3018,Date of experience: October 2018,14-Oct-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Its named correctly,The Big House. What an incredible experience and a football fans must see (even you buckeye fans). History and fantastic atmosphere. Tailgating around the stadium is extensive and people are friendly.
3019,Date of experience: October 2018,14-Oct-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,3,Nightmare trying to get out,"It??s the ??big house?? for a reason. While we enjoyed the visit, it??s not one I would do again and NOT just because my team lost. First, they set seating records because the seats are sized for pygmies. I??ll bet Camp Randall could squeeze another 20,000 people in it too if they narrow the seats to the size of these seats. It??s ok to stand the whole game when you??re 20 and tipsy but I??m 63 and my arthritic knees and bad back were killing me by the 2nd quarter. $145 per ticket for end zone seats (section 9 row 43) and there was literally no place to sit. Second, absolutely no WiFi. Couldn??t even text friends or find out how the Brewer game finally ended. (the scoreboard operator would rather tell us how Slippery Rock fared than how the NL baseball championship game ended). Third, it took nearly 2 hours to get out of Ann Arbor after the game.Traffic gridlock worse than Manhattan and not a cop in sight to keep traffic moving and prevent the continual running of red lights. It took 11 changes of traffic lights to finally make a left turn onto Main Street - one car per light. Big vehicles who didn??t seem to care if they got dents so long  as they could bulldoze their way into traffic. My moral victory? Sneaking my mini cross-body cell phone purse in despite the extreme ??no bags of any kind?? policy. Disconnect the skinny strap and use it as a belt. Shove the mini bag under my back bra strap and hide the bulge with my puffy coat. Reassemble everything in the ladies room before the game and hide it with my arm as I walked past the gauntlet of security people to my seat. Take that Michigan!!  So yes, it was an ??experience??. I??m glad we did it but never again."
3020,Date of experience: September 2018,10-Oct-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The BIG HOUSE is an awesome experience,Even though my husband attended Michigan and we went to games when no women were allowed on the field and the arena was a little smaller but still big. We lived out of the state of Michigan for many years. We found a chance to return to a might larger stadium. Parking was a crazy but available in many areas but be prepared to walk. The ticket takers were very pleasant. Asked if it was our first time. Asked where we were from. Told us to have a great time.  Game was great and brought back fun college days. The exit from parking is unreal. We decided to head through town-- which was fun to see the same and new buildings. Go Blue.
3021,Date of experience: October 2018,9-Oct-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House,"Most impressive College Football Stadium that I've been to, definitely a reason why they call it the big house!  With over 109,000 people in attendance you would think you've be waiting forever in lines, but this venue has it locked down.  From guidance on tailgating to the actual game, we very rarely waited in line either getting in/out, buying food, getting to your seat or the restroom we might have waited 5 mins.  If you're a football fan this is a must see stadium to check off your list."
3022,Date of experience: October 2018,8-Oct-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Here's what to do if you forget your ticket!,"I have probably seen over 300 games at M Stadium over the years.  This past Saturday I discovered that our tickets were left at home as our A2 bus from Weber's pulled into the Stadium.  I remarked about it loudly to my dear wife and two wonderful women in front of us turned around and educated us about what to do.  Figuring that it is now a ""pay it forward"" occasion, here is the ""secret.""  There is a ""will call"" window in the lower level of Crisler Arena around the corner from the east entrance to the Stadium.  Go there, show your ID, and you will quickly and without silly comment receive your tickets in return.  We did that and before you could say ""Gloria"" we were out the door and walking toward the Stadium.  It my have been easier because we have been season ticket holders for many years.  However, I suspect that if you bought the ticket directly from the Athletic Dept in some way (probably including via StubHub), you will be saved.In spite of unexpected great weather and any easy M win against Maryland, that was definitely the highlight of our afternoon!"
3023,Date of experience: September 2018,1-Oct-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,WOW!!!,"First visit to Michigan Stadium was a dream come true. Kicking Nebraska was good too! Not a bad seat in the House. Didn't use the concessions. Instead, at at the food trucks inside the gates after entering the stadium gates. Security check, at the gates, was very minimal which was a surprise. NO BAGS allowed. Just took my hat off and emptied my pockets. Never scanned nor went through a scanner.  Knee room at your seat was minimal. Guess that is why they get big attendance numbers. Can't wait to go back."
3024,Date of experience: September 2018,26-Sep-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Huskers No show,"Atmosphere, tailgating and stadium were a blast, the game not so much. We were blown out by Michigan, maybe next year in Lincoln. Most people were very nice as usual a few were arrogant and not nice fans from Michigan. Overall a real good time in Ann Arbor."
3025,Date of experience: September 2018,25-Sep-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,THE BIG HOUSE!!!!!,This was on my husband's bucket list and it did not disappoint. The stadium is massive. We went for the Nebraska vs. Michigan game and enjoyed mixing with the fans. There are food stands everywhere. I didn't wait long in line as I went to the concessions during the first quarter. There were a variety of vendors and there is a Michigan store on site. The tailgating stretched for miles outside of the stadium. We had an AMAZING time and Michigan got the W! Definitely would go back.
3026,Date of experience: September 2018,22-Sep-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Tens of Thousands of Fans,"Here for the Nebraska-Michigan football game.  Great tailgating at the Ann Arbor golf course just south of the stadium!  Nice to see the fans of both teams intermix.  No advertisements inside the stadium!  Long lines for food or bathrooms, not good."
3027,Date of experience: September 2018,17-Sep-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,SMU vs Michigan - Sep 2018,First time in the big house and it didn't disappoint. The stadium doesn't look as big from the outside but when you walk in you aren't let down. It's MASSIVE. There was a great flyover before the game and the stadium was loud. I would make the trip again.
3028,Date of experience: September 2018,16-Sep-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Great place to see football with your family,"We took our tween and teenager to a football game here.  It was such a great experience.  Everyone was friendly and into the game.  The stadium was basic and so easy to navigate.  We walked everywhere in the small downtown before the game.  There was plenty of restaurants and shops.   We saw families of all ages, we saw elderly, we saw college students.  Everyone we saw was having a great time.  It was such a nice change of pace from the typical NFL games we have experienced in the past.  No one around us was drunk and screaming profanity at the players.  I don't think we will ever go back to NFL games after this."
3034,Date of experience: October 2017,7-Aug-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,ALWAYS A FUN EXPERIENCE,From the tailgating to the actual event we always have a great time. We normally park on the golf course and do some tailgating and check out the cool set ups people have with TV's tents awesome parties etc. Inside the Stadium it can be a little tight but always fun and we have great seats so the view is awesome. My daughter loves the Chicago Hotdog stand she loads that baby up with jalapenos. All in all I recommend the stadium it is always a fun experience.
3036,Date of experience: August 2018,6-Aug-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Very organized,I`ve been there in a over 100.000 spectators match. Everything very organized and safe. Avoid the seats near the field if you want to watch seated.
3038,Date of experience: August 2018,4-Aug-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,2,Inefficient Will Call,"I recently attended the Man U vs Liverpool game and bought tickets directly from Uof M ticket sales. There was no option for e-tickets or mailed to home,  only option is will call. The issue is that when you have an event of 105,000 people and a lot of people are collecting tickets at will call, you should be prepared.Lines were 300 people deep for hours. I missed a significant part of the game. If you are going to charge fees for tickets, make sure you are properly prepared."
3039,Date of experience: August 2018,2-Aug-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,"Great venue for other things, not just football","Was here for the Manchester United vs Liverpool ICC match.  The venue normally doesnt sell liquor because it hosts college games but for this they did.  Plenty of concession options, overpriced as you would expect, but convenient.  Park on the golf course when that??s an option otherwise most businesses will rent out their lot, just book your space ahead if time on Park and Party or similar site."
3047,Date of experience: September 2017,26-Jun-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Best stadium in the country!,"The Big House is the largest college football stadium in the country, and has one of the best tailgating and game-watching experiences in all of sports. Simply awesome!"
3048,Date of experience: October 2017,18-Jun-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,3,Go Blue,"Must attend one game for the experience, then watch on TV. Get a hot dog despite the ridiculous cost...they're good. Parking is horrible. Seating is very cramped and uncomfortable."
3049,Date of experience: November 2017,18-Jun-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Tradition steeped with more than history,"When visiting this stadium, you really have to understand the history and the people who have gone before. It??s not just numbers of attendees or the magnitude of the college games played here. It??s the depth of the emotions played out in a seemingly simple game between opposing teams. If you are an affecionado of the college football game, try attending a game here and compare the experience with other locales. I bet you it will be a unique and fulfilling feeling."
3050,Date of experience: November 2017,12-Jun-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Great Football,Michigan Stadium is one of the best places to see a college football game. The whole city seems to support the Wolverines. Parking can be a little challenge if you go late.
3059,Date of experience: November 2017,28-Apr-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,No Place Like the Big House!,"I've been a season ticket holder for Michigan Football for more than 10 years, and have attended other events there as well - internation soccer games (a VERY different crowd than Michigan football), charity events, and much more. All workers seem to be incredibly dedicated and do their best to be helpful. I don't know how they manage the logistics of getting >100k people safely in and out of the area so quickly on game/event days, but it's pretty amazing - they have mastered this. All in all, I've never had a bad day in the stadium."
3060,Date of experience: November 2017,3-Mar-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Best stadium to watch a game,"If you are in Michigan during the Football season, you must attend a game at the Michigan Stadium.  It is the largest stadium in the country and can house over 109,000 fans.  You really do not get a feel for the stadium until you enter the stadium itself.  Once inside, you find yourself immersed  in an open cavern where the music and crowd becomes immediately contagious.  Definitely a must do experience!"
3061,Date of experience: October 2017,12-Feb-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House...and it is,"This is an experience that should be on everyone's ""Bucket List"" If you haven't been you need to go...what an amazing experience. I've been attending multiple games a year for over 40 years and I still get chills every time I walk in to the stadium."
3062,Date of experience: September 2017,6-Feb-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Family Time at the Big House,"Everyone needs to experience the Big House at least once. There is nothing else like in in sports and make sure to arrive in time to see the band take the field. So impressive! To make the most of your trip, hit Revelli Hall for the Drum Line, and follow the band to the stadium."
3063,Date of experience: October 2017,3-Feb-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,What a stadium!,"Nothing beats the view when walking into Michigan Stadium for the first time. Had a great time tailgating on the grounds, just wish it had been a bit warmer, but it was October in Michigan."
3064,Date of experience: October 2017,22-Jan-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House,An unforgettable experience if you can get tickets the view is excellent even in the endzones there are also special events where you can get into love European Soccor League collage and high school football and U of M Lacross an Soccer
3065,Date of experience: January 2018,14-Jan-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Track meet,The new indoor track facility is amazing! It was so cool to be a part of the first ever track meet there.
3066,Date of experience: November 2017,13-Jan-18,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,OSU/Michigan in the Big House!,"Our family attended the OSU Michigan game and had a great time.  ""The Big House"" is a timeless venue for an iconic game between these schools.  From the opening kickoff to the final whistle we had fun taking in the sights and sounds of a very competitive football game. I thought the stadium handled the 100 plus thousand people very well and we felt safe the whole time.  We did have a parking pass for the golf course across the street but there are numerous private homes that offer their lawns up for parking within a mile or so of the stadium.  Getting out in traffic was tough but well worth it."
3067,Date of experience: November 2017,23-Dec-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Crowds Galore,"Since it always seems to be a sellout, expect crowds everywhere - parking, entrance, merchandise kiosks, food concessions.  Surprisingly, there wasn??t much of a wait for the women??s bathrooms."
3068,Date of experience: August 2017,23-Dec-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,We are third generation alumni.,It's a nust for all Michihigan Alum or fans. There is so much to do in Ann Arbor (check your seasons and highway conditions). A2 is truly a destination for every member of your family.
3069,Date of experience: December 2017,15-Dec-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,insanity,this place is huge and holds more people than there are in my hometown. Cannot beat the experience of going here!
3070,Date of experience: September 2017,7-Dec-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,3,"Tradition, tradition, PERDITION!","Of course there's nothing like attending a home football game in Michigan Stadium.  But, you can forget about comfortable seating here, unless you're in one of the skyboxes.  The ""reconfiguration"" of the stadium several years ago seems to have amounted to little more than painting the numbers on the bleachers - and closer together at that.  Value it's not; cramped it is.  I love Michigan football and the whole experience of being at a game, but come kickoff time, you'll find my buds and me in a bar or mancave watching it on the tube."
3071,Date of experience: October 2017,4-Dec-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Always a great time,"This is a beautiful stadium. I always enjoy the gameday experience. There is always plenty of entertainment during breaks. Most importantly, this stadium isn't full to the brim with advertisements like so many other."
3072,Date of experience: November 2017,28-Nov-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Joy riding,"We were out shopping and wanted to see the stadium, we have never seen it in person it was breath taking to see"
3073,Date of experience: November 2017,28-Nov-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Worth the price of admission,"Went to the Michigan v Ohio State game. Best college football experience ever, well, maybe I had more fun as a student back in 1978 but things have certainly changed since then. We parked at Briarwood and took the shuttle. Dropped us off right at the entrance. Bus driver was hilarious. Crowd on the bus was jovial. I was actually welcomed to the stadium by the man scanning tickets, and attendant behind him. It's a small thing, but it really makes you feel like they appreciate that you're there. Hello, you've arrived at the event, welcome, we hope you have a pleasant experience and we're happy you're here. Why, Thank you. Fans were awesome. Close quarters. Everyone seems to understand that you're packed in as close as can be, but any time I was jostled or bumped, someone apologized or recognized the situation. Plenty of restrooms, clean, easy access. Plenty of food and drink options. We were in Section 10, about 30 rows up. We had to stand for a good portion of the game, but overall, it was a great time."
3074,Date of experience: October 2017,27-Nov-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,3,Tiny Butts,Enjoyed seeing a football game here.The stadium is rated to having a large capacity but you must have a tiny butt to sit in the seat.  The seating is very narrow.
3075,Date of experience: November 2017,25-Nov-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Classic Football Venue,"Michigan Stadium is a great place to watch a game, though the amenities are few and it is a crowded and not especially comfortable place. The food is pretty mediocre, and for serious fans unwilling to miss game action to get food, it is all but impossible to get food. Traffic flow is terrible within the stadium. Having said all of that, the Michigan football experience is as good as it gets. Simply plan on eating and drinking before and after the game."
3076,Date of experience: September 2017,21-Nov-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,"Attending a game at ""The Big House"" is a must do for anyone who loves football!","This is the largest stadium in the country and it holds over 110,000 people.  Michigan games are a real event with the fabulous marching band,  the cheerleaders,  the two massive screens, one on each end of the stadium, great football and really great fans.  I have seen games in many stadiums over the years and nothing quite compares to a game at the ""Big House""!"
3077,Date of experience: October 2017,20-Nov-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Electrifying Atmosphere,"There's nothing like Big Ten football. Catching a rivalry game at the Big House was a thrilling experience. The fans are passionate, and this place gets loud. Michigan boasts the largest stadium by seating capacity in the country, and it was a treat to be able to catch a game here, even though I was in support of the visitors! I definitely recommend coming early, as this place obvious gets packed, and the roads nearby are a bit tricky to navigate if it's your first time."
3078,Date of experience: October 2017,19-Nov-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Nothing Like the Big House!,"If you are a college football fan, you owe it to yourself to attend a football game at the Big House.  It's the ultimate football experience!  All with 111,000 of your closest friends!"
3079,Date of experience: November 2017,12-Nov-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Pretty cool,"The football game was pretty cool. That stadium can hold a lot of people, but I suppose it just feels smaller because the pitch is much smaller than say a rugby field. Great atmosphere"
3080,Date of experience: September 2017,11-Nov-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Football game,Everything was great. Bathrooms were clean. View spectacular.  Service of vendors convenient & quick. Everything was orderly.Thanks
3081,Date of experience: November 2017,10-Nov-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Great experience at the big house,This past weekend during the rain delay the staff were outstanding in helping my son and I get to our seats during the rain dealy.
3082,Date of experience: November 2017,9-Nov-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Always fun to see the Maize & Blue spirit on game days!,"Enjoy going to the games, especially when the weather is nice. Stadium is huge and the seat assignments are small, but the fans are fun and the atmosphere is great, especially when we're winning. Ladies, do not bring your purses. Simply not allowed."
3083,Date of experience: November 2017,8-Nov-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,No Place like the Big House,No doubt one of the best atmospheres for college football. I've been a fan since a young boy but live 6 hours away....nothing stops this fan from getting to the Big House!  Fond memories of going to games with my Dad and seeing Joe Pa get beat and the GOAT Tom Brady play!  No doubt a bucket list for sure!
3084,Date of experience: September 2017,8-Nov-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Fall football game at Michigan Stadium,"Fantastic fun with friends on a Fall day at Michigan Stadium and my pooch Grover!  Go blue! The fever in Ann Arbor on game day is amazing!  The whole town perks up from Main St to Briarwood Mall, locals celebrate a surge in the economy.  It affects waiters, cabbies, store clerks, hotel employees, grocers, dog groomers, fabric and souvenir stores eat.,."
3085,Date of experience: November 2017,8-Nov-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Big House... A huuu ge deal!,"Last visit was before the expansion, and before the addition of the extensive brickwork, when you simply walked up the hill and into the stadium.  The additions are definitely an improvement, as well as the wide screen video monitors that enable you to see what you might have missed.  In spite of the rain/lightning delay, and the mist throughout the game, there is simply no place better to view a football game.  When the plays came to our seats in the 10-yard line vicinity, we felt close enough to want to put on pads and join the fun."
3086,Date of experience: November 2017,7-Nov-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,I mean its the Big House...,"If you like college football, you'll want to figure out how to fit a Michigan game into a fall trip to Ann Arbor.  Nothing quite like it."
3087,Date of experience: November 2017,7-Nov-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House is so grand.,"What a stadium.  Pretty impressive on the outside. But nothing beats being inside during a game.   Wow, what an experience!"
3088,Date of experience: October 2017,6-Nov-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Homecoming,"What an awesome stadium, I hadn??t been back since graduation over 30 years ago. The majestic feel, the energy and the wonderful view of the field from my seat!"
3089,Date of experience: November 2017,5-Nov-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Amazing experience!,"Coming to a game at The Big House is a pretty amazing experience! The staff there is always friendly and accommodating. If it??s your kid??s first time visiting, you can bring them to the Visitors Center for a personalized certificate. Seating is bench style. So if comfort is important to you, bring a cushion. Although chances are, you may be standing for a lot of the game... the energy in there can get pretty high and it??s hard not to be excited and on your feet dancing and chanting!No alcohol is served at the stadium so grab yourself a brew beforehand at one of the local bars or at your tailgate!"
3090,Date of experience: October 2017,31-Oct-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,A bucket list must do!,Experience of a lifetime to attend a game here. No better fight song in all of college football.  The stadium is immaculate. The crowd is spirited and fun.  The game on the field is always worth watching too.  Just a great day!
3091,Date of experience: October 2017,31-Oct-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,3,Weekend Football,Stadium is close to most hotels so very easy to get to.  Very large stadium with bench type seating.  Lines for concession stands and bathrooms were ridiculously long during 1/2 time.  Great experience watching a game
3092,Date of experience: October 2017,30-Oct-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,THE BIG HOUSE,"When I was there for the Homecoming Game, 2017 it was  AWESOME than when I was last there. The Sky Boxes were impressive. The line of sight to the field was excellent. It is a huge facility.  On my  way out I had to rest. Those rows and stairs are exhausting. But, I really enjoyed being there. The  Scoreboards with the view of the plays were also, impressive."
3093,Date of experience: October 2017,29-Oct-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Big,"They don??t call it the Big House for nothing.  112,000.  Beautiful inside and out.  Bench seating so it takes toll on backside.  Bring seat cushion."
3094,Date of experience: October 2017,29-Oct-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House,Simply put there is no finer football watching experience in the world. Aluminum bench seats can be tough on the back and the butt especially in chilly weather. Pro tip: bring a seat cushion and if it is cold maybe a blanket. Food is ehhhIt is crowded and loud but I??d give it 6 stars if I could. Tailgating is out of this world.  Generations of  blue supporters.  A lot of fun. Tradition.
3095,Date of experience: October 2017,29-Oct-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,How could it be anything less that 5/5!,"Tremendous experience, to watch a game in the Big House!  It's unlike watching football anywhere else.  It's a life event."
3096,Date of experience: October 2017,24-Oct-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Top football stadium in the country,The U of M  is one of the first universities in the country to have a football stadium over 100 years ago. This is the largest football stadium in the country. It is quite an experience to see a game here. It??s a shame they don??t sell alcohol!!

3098,Date of experience: October 2017,13-Oct-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Welcome to the Big House.,"Welcome to the Big House.  There is no place around like it.  I have seen up to 115,000 fans here at a time to watch the football games.  It is exciting, loud, fun and entertaining"
3099,Date of experience: October 2017,12-Oct-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Hail to the Victors..... Very tight stadium seating... Like sardines,"The stadium seating was like sardines. But the ambiance, the Super screens and the college spirit was amazing. Too bad the U of M team lost to MSU. Oh, I also didn't mention that it poured rain with 10 minutes left in the game. We left the stadium and listened to the end of the game on the way back to the hotel."
3100,Date of experience: October 2017,11-Oct-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,GO BLUE!!!!,"Fulfilled a childhood dream last Saturday night. Michigan football in the Big House!!! Even got to watch it in a monsoon! Lol My Wolverines lost, but it was an AMAZING experience!!! Love the Big House!!!!!"
3101,Date of experience: October 2017,11-Oct-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,the big house!,"Michigan Stadium ""the big house"" is an excellent stadium to watch a football game. Saw the team play Michigan State last weekend and totally enjoyed, despite to torrential down pour of rain in the 3rd quarter. Great Stadium!"
3102,Date of experience: October 2017,11-Oct-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,"This is the best football stadium in the world, by far. Perfect architecture and seating for the fans.",I have been attending MIchigan football games at Michigan Stadium since 1981. Every experience is better than the next.
3103,Date of experience: October 2017,11-Oct-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Always a blast!,"My dad went to U of M and has season tickets to the football games. We bought his tickets for the Michigan-Michigan State game. This was our third visit to the Big House and each time has been great! They have a nice variety of food and items for sale on the concourse. My husband loves their kettle corn. They do a good job with the video screen and having interesting things playing during time outs and breaks. The marching band does an excellent job (one of my favorite parts of going to football games). They do really pack people in the stadium, so it's a little squished, but when you're in the middle of an exciting play it's not noticeable."
3104,Date of experience: October 2017,11-Oct-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,It's The Big House - nothing more need be said,"112,000 screaming maize and blue clad fanatics streaming into and out of one of the coolest stadiums in the country.  Even if you're not much of a football fan, this is a bucket list experience which everyone should do at least once.  And FYI the crowd is well behaved, lots of police, security, ushers, etc. so there aren't those awful moments with absurdly drunk and/or loud knuckleheads - I think that the fans know better as it's such a privilege to attend a game at The Big House.  If you're visiting Ann Arbor during football season, try very hard to go to a game - you won't regret it."
3105,Date of experience: October 2017,9-Oct-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,College visit for baseball,"Got to see a Michigan state vs. Michigan game after the the baseball tour with coaches. Seats were awesome. My son got to be on the sideline for awhile before game time. He said it was an amazing experience. They are not Lyon Gehenna they say the ""Big House"" is packed!!"
3106,Date of experience: October 2017,8-Oct-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Big House Seats 110k... Ford Field 80k. Let that Sink In,"I was here for the Michigan/State game as I wanted to check that off my bucket list as a State fan. I had never seen a game as this ""big house"" of lore from Michigan fans so I wanted to do it at least once. Well, it lived up to the hype. The town was crazy with all of the partying and people and excitement. It was really pretty overwhelming. We had gotten there around 5 hours before game time, and the streets were backed up all of the way to the highway. We ended parking a mile away on a residential street and walking in. Which is fine, as we walk a lot so it was not that big a deal for us. However, for those very few lots that were not full at this time of day, they cost $20-50.00 per car, so plan accordingly if you do not like/want to walk. The stadium is impressive by the volume of people it can seat and the noise of the game. The stadium had a lot of character which is nice to see versus the function facilities you see on occasion at sporting events. They had a LOT of different food options and variety as well versus a standard offering throughout. I did not like that you had no reentry, and they pack that bleacher seating like sardines, so if you are bigger, you will need to give that some consideration as well as the butt pillow. You are not allowed to take in purses/backpacks or alike, so make sure you read your ticket info if female on what is permitted before you walk it in. I was pretty impressed with the stadium, and if you are a Michigan fan, you will love it here as the fans are pretty over the top for their team. At least if you sit on the ""home"" side. I do not get to a lot of events where you see fans so into their team to this degree. Only the Browns come to mind, those are some passionate fans. Lastly, make sure you get your tickets early in the season where you can get them at face value versus waiting too long. The market up is absolutely insane. A $71.00 costs you $700+ if you are not getting early for a row 25 seat. That is crazy on the mark up. But if you plan ahead, I am sure you can get them without busting the budget."
3107,Date of experience: September 2017,7-Oct-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Go Blue!!,Great place to watch a game. Seats are a little tight for me??I??m 6??4?? and broad shouldered. Have been here before and sat in the stands for big games and it??s a bit tight. This one was in a friend??s box...definitely the way to go!
3108,Date of experience: November 2016,4-Oct-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Football is a more than just an event here!,"Being that this is the country's biggest college football stadium (official capacity: 109,901!).  A football game is more than a mere ""event"" - spectacle is more appropriate.  President Barack Obama gave the commencement address here in 2010, it hosted International Champions Cup soccer in 2014, and even the NHL Winter Classic in 2014.  Generally, it is not used for anything besides football.  Still a must see - all other stadiums pale by comparison!"
3109,Date of experience: September 2017,2-Oct-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,"When in Ann Arbor during football season, go to a game!","An experience you cannot miss a football game at Michigan Stadium.  To sit with 107,601 crazy football fans is quite the experience.  Oh yes, don't forget it's all about the Michigan Wolverine football team and college football."
3110,Date of experience: September 2017,29-Sep-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Extremely Cramped.,Could not believe how little room there was in this stadium.  People were all cramped in.Our seats were in the centre  no one moved at Halftime to go to the concessions or bathroom.Great atmosphere but try and book an end seat.
3111,Date of experience: September 2017,27-Sep-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,First big-time college football game,"If you've never been, you should experience it. It was a sea of humanity -- over 111,000 attendance. College spirit in full flower. Concession food was actually good!"
3112,Date of experience: September 2017,27-Sep-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House is BIG!,"I was beyond excited to go to a game at the Big House! It lived up to the expectations! Air Force even almost beat Michigan.. that's the only way the experience could have been better! Away will call was a hike from my tailgating location, but still loved every minute of going to a home Michigan football game! Every sports fan must go!"
3113,Date of experience: September 2017,26-Sep-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Huge,"I have never experienced a more awesome sight than walking into the University of Michigan Stadium. However, that wasn't the only lasting impression I received that day. Unless a person were to experience a U of M football game they could only imagine being among over 110,000 screaming fans.  Fantastic!"
3114,Date of experience: September 2017,22-Sep-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,UC-Michigan Game,"Very large stadium. Excellent food choices and plenty of concessions and restrooms. Seating was tight, but very usual for a college stadium."
3115,Date of experience: September 2017,20-Sep-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Surreal,"I have been a Wolverine's fan most of my life, my sister and I brought my dad for a game, as we had never been there before. Stadium staff was friendly and nice."
3116,Date of experience: September 2017,20-Sep-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Lives up the billing,"I went to Michigan Stadium for the first time to watch my alma mater (University of Cincinnati) take on U of M. The Big House did not disappoint. We spent the morning tailgating at the golf course, which is only a short walk to the stadium. We were in the ""UC Section"", so we were near the top. Fair to say there isn't a bad seat in the house. Obviously with 100,000+, it can feel a little cramped, but nothing to overly complain about. I enjoyed my experience, would go back and recommend it to football die-hards and casual fans alike!"
3117,Date of experience: September 2017,19-Sep-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Awesome time at the Big House!,"We had a blast for this bucket list item on my hubby's birthday. Anywhere you sit is a great seat. Make sure you tailgate on the golf course prior & you are allowed to stay 2 hours after the game. Great stadium, great seats & great win! Go Blue!"
3118,Date of experience: September 2017,19-Sep-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Great Fun to see a Game in the Big House,"Enjoyed the Air Force game immensely, visiting with friends who live in Ann Arbor.  It is typical of big-time college football stadiums, but perhaps grander because of the size.  The attendance was 113,000+ and electrifying."
3119,Date of experience: September 2017,16-Sep-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The  Big House is like none other!,"The stadium is HUGE! The staff whether it's security people, ushers, people selling food- all friendly and helpful. The bathrooms are clean and the atmosphere.. nothing else like it on earth! GO BLUE"
3120,Date of experience: September 2017,15-Sep-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,2017 Football Season begins,We have enjoyed season tickets for University of Michigan football for over 20 years. We have seen a lot of changes in the stadium itself during that time. This summer a lot of changes were made in Stadium Blvd for which we are grateful. The sidewalk has been extended on the south side of the street all the way to Main Street. This makes it easier to walk out of the area to the east. We can cross the street directly across from Gate 2 with police help. We appreciate these improvements.
3121,Date of experience: September 2017,15-Sep-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The BIG House,"If you haven't experienced this, it is a must. It is exciting empty or filled. You can't help getting caught in the moment. Go Blue."
3122,Date of experience: October 2016,13-Sep-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,My Husband's 70th Birthday,"A cool day for a football game.but there is not better place to be on Saturday afternoon with family.  Our son and his family, our daughter and her faimily,my husband sister and her husband from Texas, and my husband's sister and her grandchildren from Ohio all came to celebrate my husband's 70th birthday."
3123,Date of experience: September 2017,13-Sep-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Top notch college complex,"I was overwhelmed with this college complex. Along with the academic programs available, the athletic facilities for all the various sports were the best I have ever seen and I have visited many. The football stadium, being the largest in the US, is beautifully laid out so that every seat has an unobstructed view of the football field. You would think that a stadium that seats approx.115,000 people that some seats would be so far away that you would not have a good view. That is not the case here. Each athletic program has it's own modern facility. Outstanding venues."
3124,Date of experience: September 2017,11-Sep-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,University of Michigan Stadium,"We attended the University of Cincinnati vs. U of M football game.  The facility was clean and easily accessed with an abundance of food concessions available.  I've been to many stadiums that handled crowds of half the size far worse.  The lack of posted advertising inside of the stadium was a refreshing surprise.  To a person, everyone we dealt with who worked at the stadium was very nice and inviting.  Almost all of our interactions with Michigan fans were very positive - like almost everywhere, some of the younger fans (students and younger) could be unfriendly, but that was certainly not unique to U of M and probably less bad there than most places."
3125,Date of experience: September 2017,11-Sep-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House Experience!,"What an honor to visit one of the College Football's Shrines.  The Big House (Michigan Stadium) holds over 111,000 people for football.  Everyone that likes college football should experience at least one game at this historical stadium.  One thing that really impressed me was the friendly stadium staff who made my experience even more memorable."
3127,Date of experience: October 2016,6-Sep-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,"Imposing,accessible  and perfect for football games",50 years of U of M football here. The place is a legend. I'm happy to report that I can now access games with my mov pilot you scooter.
3128,Date of experience: November 2016,6-Sep-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Big House is the best,"I have been attending games at the Big House since 1989, and have only missed a few games in that period. Seating us tight, jut the ambiance, the energy and the comradely of sitting amongst 100,000 of your closest Wolverine fanatic friends is still a big joy. I've also been to OSU, IL, IN, MSU and WI stadium football games, and only Wisconsin comes close to the feeling I get every Sunday in Ann Arbor. Even if you root for another team, you should check it out."
3130,Date of experience: October 2016,6-Sep-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Great Stadium and Great Team,"The updates to the stadium (restrooms etc.) are wonderful.  When going through the main gate, go to the right lanes for faster entry."

3136,Date of experience: November 2016,8-Aug-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Big house thrill,"Hands down if you want a true American college football experience, get a ticket to a game at Michigan Stadium. While all games are ""sold out,"" the ones that attract big out of town following are the most fun and noisy. Nothing will ever top a night game vs. Notre Dame, but there are so many that come close, e.g. Michigan State, Penn State, a team from an adjacent state to the south. Parking and traffic are a hassle, but there is plenty in surrounding neighborhoods for about $20. Leave purses and open containers at home. Bring a cushion if you like to sit vs stand. Enjoy!!!"
3137,Date of experience: September 2016,6-Aug-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,University of Michigan campus and stadium are the best!,Also an exciting place to enjoy Big 10 football. The band is amazing and the cheers of the crowds are electrifying!

3143,Date of experience: August 2016,18-Jul-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Uncomfortable seating; expensive food; great atmosphere,I went to U-M and attended many games while I was there. This review is for a neutral audience (i.e. non-Michigan and non-Ohio-State fans). 1- The seats are very uncomfortable unless you sit in the suite. Far worse than all professional stadiums/arenas. 2- Be prepared for brutal sunshine or crazy rain. 3- Food items and drinks are crazy expensive. NOT recommended. 4- It is always a great atmosphere. The Ohio State game is absolutely crazy!! You almost have to protect your ears during the game.
3145,Date of experience: September 2016,23-Jun-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Tips for People visiting The Big House,"THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN FOOTBALL STADIUM ~ ""The Big House"" Affectionately known as ??The Big House,?? it??s the biggest stadium in the US and second largest in the world (college or NFL). Official capacity is 107,501, but actual attendance regularly reaches over 110,000. In fact, the stadium holds the last two largest crowd records (2013 and 2011) for college football games, both against Notre Dame. My daughter worked in groundskeeping at the stadium for a few seasons and during a reunion treated the whole family to a tour everyone enjoyed. You can arrange tours of the Stadium if you??d like to see behind the scenes. I've attended two football games at the stadium, one before and one after the expansion, and loved the atmosphere and everything about the experience. Well, all except the small spaces allowed for all different size posteriors on the wood benches with no backs :)GETTING THEREThe Big House??s address is 1201 S Main Street, located on the corner of Stadium Road and Main Street just south of Downtown Ann Arbor.

3147,Date of experience: October 2016,14-Jun-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Nothing like a visit to the Big House!,"Football and other events here are special and for a good reason.  This is the Big House, home of Michigan Football and the U of M Marching Band both of which are terrific even when things go wrong.  There's no feeling like walking into the Big House no matter the event that brought you there."
3148,Date of experience: October 2016,14-Jun-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Historic;Best Stadium In College Football,"I had season tickets here for 20 years and took it for granted. Later, after the renovation, I was back for a game and realized how much this place meant to me. Biggest stadium in the country and when they put 114,000+ fans in...it rocks."

3162,Date of experience: November 2016,20-Apr-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Hail to the Victors,"I visited Michigan Stadium before it became known as ""The Big House."" As sports editor of the Daily Illini, the University of Illinois' student newspaper, I covered the Illinois/Michigan football game at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor in 1960. It was the first meeting between the Elliott brothers, Illinois coach Pete and Michigan coach Bump. Michigan won 8-7. A lot has changed since then. Built in 1927, Michigan Stadium has grown by leaps and bounds under the leadership of Michigan icons Fielding Yost, Fritz Crisler, Don Canham and Bo Schembechler. In 1960, Crisler Arena, which is adjacent to Michigan Stadium, was only a dream in Crisler's mind at the time. Today, a Saturday afternoon at Michigan Stadium is a social event. With a capacity of 107,601, it is the largest stadium in the United States and the second largest in the world, behind only Rungrado (150,000) in North Korea. It attracted 115,109 for the Notre Dame/Michigan football game in 2013. It drew 104,491 for a Toronto/Detroit hockey game in 2014. And it drew 109,318 for a Real Madrid/Manchester United soccer match in 2014. Since 1975, every home football game has attracted over 100,000 people. In 2007, Michigan Stadium underwent a $226 million renovation that included a new press box, 83 luxury boxes and 3,200 club seats. In 2010, permanent lights were added for night games. No matter where you sit--I've been in the press box, the end zone and the 25-yard line--you have a good view of the field and, most importantly, you feel as though you are a part of the biggest show on earth."
3168,Date of experience: December 2016,4-Apr-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,It IS The Big House After All,"Like Fenway Park, Yankee Stadium, Old Trafford, the U of M stadium is a landmark of sports culture. If you like the accoutrement of the college sporting life, find a way to attend a game here, with 100,000 of your closest friends."
3169,Date of experience: November 2016,30-Mar-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The BIG House.,"Best place to be on a football Saturday. From tailgating at sun up or being part of the largest crowd watching a football game anywhere in the country, this is the place to be. The atmosphere is as good as anywhere in college football. It's a must see experience."
3172,Date of experience: October 2016,23-Mar-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Go Blue!,"Football fan or not, go to a U of M game at the Big House for the awesome event that it is.

Fans of all ages can be found cheering on their Mighty Wolverines.Hail!"
3173,Date of experience: November 2016,22-Mar-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Big House,"An experience that is not matched anywhere. If you haven't been, visit.  Mid October games have weather in the 50's/60's and are absolutely beautiful. Doesn't hurt you are watching the most iconic football team in the country."
3176,Date of experience: November 2016,15-Mar-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House,"There's nothing like attending a football game at Michigan Stadium in the fall. At 109,101 seating capacity it is the largest stadium in the US.  The tradition of the band high stepping out of the tunnel is a sight to behold. The team also enters from the tunnel to the roar of the crowd. There's a good selection of refreshments, no alcohol and no smoking."
3179,Date of experience: November 2016,13-Mar-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Love!,Such a happy place to be!  We love going to U of M football games at the Big House.  Always the best fall activity!
3182,Date of experience: September 2016,27-Feb-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,"Game day, go Blue!",Great because it's U of M. Cost of concessions crazy high. Parking ridiculous! Cheap seats give you about 13inches of bench space. They won though!
3184,Date of experience: November 2016,17-Feb-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Go Blue!,Another great experience at the Big House.  This time we watch the Wolverines take on Indiana in what turned out to be a fun time as the snow came down.
3185,Date of experience: September 2016,16-Feb-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,An excellent trip to the BIG house!,"Every year my group of friends get together for an away game trip to support our UCF Knights and when our game against the University of Michigan was scheduled, we couldn't wait for our trip to the BIG house to support our Knights. While the game certainly didn't go the way we hoped, the trip to the BIG house didn't disappoint. The tailgate scene before the game was great and the Michigan faithful still showed up and filled the BIG house even with the threat of bad weather looming over us. Lucky for us, the weather held out and I'm very happy to have had the chance to visit one of college football's most famous stadiums. After the game, we were fortunate enough to visit the press box thanks to a friend's sister who worked there and were able to really appreciate just how big this stadium is! It's an old school bowl shaped stadium and the fans there are exceptionally passionate about their beloved Wolverines. And even though we were rooting for our team, the Michigan faithful were cordial and accommodating during our trip. It was an awesome experience and if you're in to college football, you should make visiting the BIG house a priority."

3187,Date of experience: November 2016,13-Feb-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The BIG house,"After visiting many stadiums throughout the world, I can state that the Michigan Stadium is one of the best. For sure, it is the biggest I have been and the atmosphere found there is great. I know that every college has its own way to watch a football game but, having 110,000+ people cheering and having fun is unique. I attended games both in the general admission and in the cabins and everyone, from there security personnel to the servers are always in a good mood and really enjoy being there. The only problems is the number and size of the restrooms: be prepared for lines at ANY time. It is a must see experience."
3189,Date of experience: August 2016,6-Feb-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Soccer game,I have been there 3 times for soccer games and it is a very good stadium to watch good matches! It is very easy to get inside and to leave after the game. Several fast food offers and restrooms are as clean as could be for a 110000 attendance. Wish there was more cover seats but all in all it is a fantastic stadium to watch any type of sports.
3190,Date of experience: November 2016,26-Jan-17,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Outstanding Venue,"This is the most outstanding sports stadium in the USA. Football saturdays at the ""Big House"" are an incredible experience. The stadium is ALWAYS packed (>110,000) with fans the vast majority of whom support UM. There is not a bad seat in the place but seating is tight. For those uninitiated, do not attempt to bring in unnecessary ""stuff"" (backpacks, purses, etc). You will have to check it. Stadium staff are very helpful and friendly. This is NOT a place to arrive at the last minute and expect to plunk yourself down where ever you want. Arrive early and expect to sit where your tickets say and this may not be with your friends. Veteran attendees sit where they are suppose to and do not move to accommodate the three buddies you brought along whose tickets are ten sections away. By and large though the fans, though loudly supportive of the home team, are gracious and polite to visitors. Due to traffic it is best to stay until the end of a game and then enjoy the post game band concert on the stadium floor. Well worth it and then head to State Street or Main for a brew and meal.

If you like crowds, this is the place to be on a beautiful Fall day.  You may have to wait in line sometimes for some services, but that's okay with me."

One of the best things about going to a game is tailgating on the Golf Course with all the fans. Even though I am a Michigan fan I have always found everyone very friendly unlike other stadium tailgates I have attended.

3203,Date of experience: November 2016,4-Dec-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House,Amazing the size of this place.  Bring something to sit on the seats are a metal bench.  The numbering system is a little different.  One long metal bench spans two sections.  The numbering starts in the middle.  For a row seat 1 is in the middle and seat 12 is on the end.  then there is a walkway and 13 starts at the end and the row continues until seat number 25.  There is plenty of places to eat and a store to buy cloths.  One time I went to the stadium it turned real cold and we ended up going to the store for a jacket and blanket.  If you are staying in a hotel there is bus service too the stadium.

There were 8 of us and we were lucky enough (and financially lucky enough) to get great seats at mid-field in the 16th row.I cannot put into words how great an experience it was.  It was cold and it began to snow late in the game but it was AWESOME...almost enough for me to become a Wolverines fan, NO as it's the Tar Heels all the way but it was a great time.The stadium is across from the golf course and that is where you go to tailgate.  Make sure you arrive early enough as the place fills up with the faithful quickly.  The attendance was 110, 522 which is unreal.  There is parking across from the Stadium also but that also gets rammed.  At the golf course you are parking on parts of the fairway and it's awesome.  There are plenty of washrooms set up and yes, by the start of the game, people's aim has deteriorated!  (ewwww).I would totally recommend going to a game there...it's a religious experience and a must do for sports fan of any team.  Hail to the Victors......oh yeah, Michigan won over Indiana lol"

Michigan... day before game 73 degrees, gameday 33, wind from the northwest at 20+ mph and blowing snow.  What would fans want to drink?  ""Iced anything""... NO!   Hot Chocolate and Coffee!   Both SOLD OUT before halftime!   Ran out of hot dogs in most areas, had to wait in three concession lines and we had vouchers for ""Hot dog and drink""...   It must be their ""first try"" with a big crowd... oh wait, this is the 200th consecutive 100,000 attendance game.  Hot drink would have been great, froze our tails off."

3215,Date of experience: November 2016,10-Nov-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House,"Michigan Stadium is a can't miss landmark if you're in southern Michigan. It's an impressive bowl with the majority of the stadium below grade. The 2010 renovations have created a significant above ground sight line with club seats and luxury boxes. It also expanded the covered concourse on the east and west sides of the stadium. If you're looking to purchase seats for game day, seek out tickets located on the sides, avoid corners. Keep in mind the stadium is dry and there is a strict ""no bags, packs or purses"" policy."
3217,Date of experience: November 2016,8-Nov-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,phenomenal experience,"a trip to the big house is worth a thousand effusive words.  college pageantry, amazing sightlines and an unparalleled atmosphere of fun and color."

Of course the band was great as always, the student section rowdy, and our game was a blowout so my daughter (her first time visiting) had the fight song memorized quickly!  This is a must see for college football fans.  Unbelievable that there are 110,000 in here and how it was built into the ground instead of up."
3220,Date of experience: November 2016,6-Nov-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,First Michigan Game,Loved the stadium.  Great seat from anywhere and no obstructed views.  Gradual rise to top of stadium so you don't feel like you are that high up.  Plenty of Food vendors and Restrooms.  Great Crowd and people around us.  With over 110K people expect to have delays in parking or leaving.  We parked about a mile away and was fine to walk after game.  Bench seating so bring a cushion if you don't have one already paid for.
3221,Date of experience: November 2016,6-Nov-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Game Day,Spend all day at or around the stadium.  It is a great experience I will never forget.  No alcohol available anywhere near the stadium.  Need to tailgate if you want a pregame drink.

Our seats were in the suites so we enjoyed the game from a luxury suite with food and beverages, private bathrooms and access to the club level. This was the way to do it! This will now become an annual trip! What a stadium! 111,000+ patrons attended the game. I was also VERY impressed with the ease of getting in and out of the game. The police officers and traffic control have this down to a science. I applaud them for managing such a high volume of people in such an efficient way. Highly recommend you visit the Big House!"
3224,Date of experience: October 2016,3-Nov-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Best footbal stadium,"The ""Big House"" is the best football stadium in the world.  This is the only stadium that has over 100,000 seats but still maintains a close relationship with the field, even nicely elevated for front row seats.  There is no track around the stadium, which makes this possible"
3225,Date of experience: October 2016,3-Nov-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Our Favorite Place to Be on a Fall Saturday,"Okay, we are Michigan alums and one of us played football here, but there is still no better scene on a football Saturday than here with 115,000 other fans.  When the amazing tailgates are winding down, the incredible Michigan Marching Band comes marching through the parking lot and into the famous tunnel to enter the field, playing music the whole way.  We've taken friends from the east coast here and they've loved it.  A recent illness required a wheelchair and special seating and the attention to disabled people was warm and helpful and the view of the field from this area was the best!  Ask for ADA tickets if you need this accommodation.  If you can't get any game tickets, the whole area around the stadium and throughout Ann Arbor is electric with excitement and activity."

3227,Date of experience: September 2016,1-Nov-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,"Great fans! Don't confuse ""biggest"" with ""most crowded"" though...","The fans are great, perhaps the best in the country. If you wear your visiting team gear, expect to be treated with respect which is more than you can say for probably 99% of stadiums across the country. However, the stadium shouldn't be referred to as the ""big house"", it's really the ""crowded as $#%@ house"". They wouldn't even let me bring in a fanny pack because they don't allow bags. I was able to roll the fanny pack up and fit it in my pocket but that wasn't allowed for some reason. They pack you in there like you are sardines. The stadium is definitely the most crowded stadium in the country. Was it worth coming here- yes. Is is the coolest college venue in the country- Absolutely not."
3229,Date of experience: October 2016,29-Oct-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,A must see!,"First time ever at a college football game and an open stadium.  It was a great experience.   The game started at 330p, we arrived around 2p when the gates opened.  We parked in the golf course for $50 which was well worth it because it was directly across the street from the stadium.  Also at that time they stopped taking cash and was only allowing passes to park, which we purchased off park and party website.  Quite a few of different eatery tents outside.  Inside the stadium was the basic stadium food.  Not bad but not worth the cost.  Stadium was roomy and there were bathrooms everywhere.  Very clean.  Seating is all benches so bring a pad for your butt for better comfort or you can purchase one there.  Very controlled crowds, didn't notice the usual yelling falling down drunks we are used to seeing at professional games.  Great team and family atmosphere.  Traffic wasn't too bad but we did get there early and left at the end of the 3rd so it was easy in and easy out.  Drive from Eastpointe to the golf course took 40 mins."

The atmosphere there when watching a football game is unparalleled.  It has been renovated or kept up to date in recent years. Getting in and out of the stadium is a lot easier than a lot of other stadia I have been to. Even at the end of the game, departing from the stadium was a breeze.There are plenty of tailgating areas that can easily hold tens of thousands of fans."

This is the biggest stadium in the US if I am not mistaken and we have been for Soccer games as well as Football games. Food and Beverage prices are what you may assume to be, fairly high, but at least the selection of food and beverages are better here than at most stadiums I've been to."

But the only way to experience the Big House is to attend a game.  Tickets are becoming harder to get, but if you're patient and willing to spend a little money, you can usually buy them in front of the Stadium before the game.  Since the renovation, there are plenty of bathrooms and concession stands.  Depending on the section of your seats, it can take some time to get seated.  But once you're there, it's a great experience.  And the Marching Band is amazing."

3248,Date of experience: October 2016,5-Oct-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Go Blue!,"My wife and I came out to see the Wolverines dominate and we weren't disappointed.  The stadium is amazing and easy to navigate.  Gates open 2hrs before kickoff.  Make sure to check out the band when the walk over and you can see the players arrive too.  You'll need to read up on game day traditions so you can fit in and make sure you have watched a video on ""the victors"" so that you can participate properly after touchdowns.  Lots of food choices too, no beer though."

3252,Date of experience: October 2016,4-Oct-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Wow this Place is Big,We had not been to Ann Arbor for over three decades to see our Badgers play Michigan so it has been awhile since we were in this stadium.  It is alot bigger than in the 80s and it sure is an electric place to see a game.We all noticed that the Michigan fans were very welcoming and friendly - not our experience years ago.  Perhaps a decade of mediocre football helped adjust some fans demeanor to the opposing team's fans...
3253,Date of experience: September 2016,2-Oct-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,"Better than the Stadium, the Fans and the People of Ann Arbor","Thank you Ann Arbor, and Thank you Michigan fans !  My brother and I and my brothers daughter and son are all big Wisconsin fans.   I have to say that, although Wisconsin lost the game this weekend, we had a great time in Ann Arbor.  Michigan fans went of their way to wish us good luck before the game and thank us for visiting Ann Arbor.   What a great college town.  Love their team, and definitely like to party, but also seem to embody that true Midwestern hospitality. Even the guy at the liquor store, as we were leaving town today with some fine Michigan craft brews, was appreciative of our visit.  A special thank you to Biercamp for their great pre game brats and beer. Parking next door was great too, and close to the stadium. Oh, and the stadium, with 111,848 fans was pretty darn good too."

3255,Date of experience: September 2016,2-Oct-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Take me home . . .,"I have been a Michigan Fan forever. In 1978 we moved to California, thus ending our season tickets at Michigan. I had been back for a couple of games while my oldest was in college there. Always on my bucket list was a trip back. My daughters and I had great tickets last week at the Penn State game. Walking up your tunnel into the stadium is such a breathtaking experience. We walked in, the sky was blue and the all you could see in the stands was maize and blue. I was worried before we left that I would have to climb stairs with no railing. Not to worry! Railings were installed during the remodel. If you have never been to a Midwestern college football game, this is the place to visit. The enthusiasm is unsurpassed. Everyone sitting around us was friendly - no drunks! If you don't know that Michigan fight song when you arrive you will certainly know it when you leave.We parked near the Michigan Union and walked .09 mile to the stadium. There is lots to see on that walk and I was able to take really good pictures with my iPhone.  There were a lot of commercial breaks during this game as it was televised, but the cheer teams kept us entertained the entire time.This trip to Michigan Stadium met all my expectations.  Someone suggested getting food before going to the game and that is a good recommendation as the stadium food is my only negative.  It could be a lot better!"
3256,Date of experience: October 2016,2-Oct-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Outstanding venue for a college football game,"What a great place to watch a college football game! Have a great game day experience - park in the neighborhood or at the golf course and have a tailgate party with friends; witness the fans - high intensity team spirit, with gracious and good manners to visitors; listen to the university band play ""Hail to the Victors"", ""Varsity"", etc.; experience being in a bowl with over 110,000 fans - deafening noise; great sight lines; watch an historically great football team. If there were possible downsides: being at the bottom of the bowl, and you need to go to the bathroom! You'll have about 70-rows to climb and lines at Mens and Womens rooms. That said - ""Go Blue!"""
3257,Date of experience: October 2016,2-Oct-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,"""Big House"" Game day experience","If you go to the ""Big House"" all the time don't read this. You already know all about it and what to do better than I do. This is my 2nd time to see a game here. Last was about 10 yrs ago. This is a great open air stadium. The crowd is huge (111,000+) and that means some prep is needed . The stadium itself is easy to get around. One level and you can walk all of the way around. With this many people I suggest you arrive early. If you're tailgating by yourself have an idea of where you're going and get there early ( 3 + hours ) so you can find a spot to set up. We walked about 3/4 of a mile and paid $25 in a church parking lot on Stadium drive. We had use of the church bathrooms before and an hour after the game. There weren't any tailgate spots here 3 hours before, just parking. Eat before you go in. Food is available but the brat was nasty and expensive. All the food looked expensive. It's nice if you can hook up with a Michigan fan with a nearby tailgate. Be advised like most stadiums the seats are narrow so dress accordingly. Ladies no purses with straps. If you can't put it in your pocket don't take it. Finally, unless you time it right or leave early, plan to spend a little time getting out (but if you're a fan you know that already). Last note: This is an experience for all but in my opinion not the best experience in the Big Ten. Much as I hate to say it try "" The Horseshoe"" and with prejudice (I 'm from Wisconsin) Camp Randall. Columbus and Madison are both college towns but also large cities."

The weather called for rain on this day of rivalry between the wolverines and the badgers. Wow, big ten champions are going to tear up the turf with excitement from the fans coming here from all over. It is the most beautiful stadium I've been in. It's as big as the sky open above, maybe that's why they call this place the BIG HOUSE. Fans are as friendly as you could be if you'd know them in how appreciative they are to meet you. Paul and I brought his missionary brother and sister in law, he serves as Doctor and she in admin in parts of the world, mainly Africa. Their longtime friend from college days at University Of Michigan came too. What a blast we're having as the seats fill with spectators and the anticipation bulilds before kickoff.

3260,Date of experience: September 2016,30-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,A Must - See Experience!,"My son and I have no connection to either team playing, but we went to see the Michigan-Penn State game.  We did not have tickets, but found 50 YARD LINE  seats 23 rows up.  Facevalue $125, we paid $40 each.  Visitor side.So everything was incredible.  My son goes to Univ of Ark, and sees all the SEC teams, and he said that was the most amazing pre-game he had ever seen.  It is truly a sight to behold.  The tail-gating did seem a little lame compared to football in the South, but all else was top-notch!"
3261,Date of experience: September 2016,29-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Cool place to watch and experience a college football game.,"If you're visiting to watch your team play Michigan, there are pre-game parties (tailgate parties at homes and any open fields) everywhere within a 3-5 mile radius from the stadium.  These can start the night before and continue up until game time and beyond.I went to a New Years Day Rose Bowl Game in my teens and this game in my mid-60s, these stadiums have gotten a bit more uncomfortable the older I get. But, it still is a trip worth doing, especially, with some old retired guys on a road trip,"

3265,Date of experience: September 2016,27-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Go Blue!,"My husband and I are season ticket holders for U of M football. After years of attending games, I can honestly say that it never gets old. The stadium is clean and safe. The food vendors and retail shops are top notch. The atmosphere is classic college football."
3266,Date of experience: September 2016,26-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Impressive Stadium,Extremely beautiful brick stadium with a great atmosphere ... really layed out well with easy access to concessions and rest rooms ... well done
3267,Date of experience: September 2016,25-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,The place to be on a saturday of games !,Huge stadium (more than 100000 sets) where you can have a good view even from the highest sets but the sets themselves are quite small... Don't expect to have space when watching american football !
3268,Date of experience: September 2016,25-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,U of M home game vs. Penn State.,"The ""M Den"" staff was great and very helpful. The event staff personal was courteous and informative. This was not a just a good home game but a U of M experience. Plenty of cashiers ready to take your orders so your wait isn't long. Even staff where at every exit and tunnel to assist."
3269,Date of experience: September 2016,25-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Michigan Stadium  A must for any college football fan,"Like most Big Ten Stadiums, Michigan Stadium does not disappoint.  It is a wonderful experience for any Michigan fan."
3270,Date of experience: September 2016,24-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Great Football Stadium,"I am a Michigan alum, and certainly have a bias in favor of Michigan Stadium. It is a great football venue, and has the added advantage of being an easy walk from the central campus.Everybody should visit the Big House."
3271,Date of experience: September 2016,24-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,An event even for a non-sports fan,"Every football game in recent memory at the Big House has had more than 100,000 in attendance and everyone should experience it at least once. It is deceiving because you enter at about row 75, so very little is visible from outside."
3272,Date of experience: September 2016,24-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House,"If you have never been to the Big House, you have to go!  We went to band rehearsal and as we entered the stadium, Security said.  Welcome to the Big House!!!   Way cool."
3273,Date of experience: September 2016,24-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Love it!,"Great atmosphere, family friendly and first class facility! Even better now with Harbaugh as head coach!"
3274,Date of experience: September 2016,23-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The best experience ever.,"It feels a little weird reviewing a football stadium but Michigan Stadium was unlike anything I've ever experienced. I splurged on a trip to a game for my husband for our one year wedding anniversary and I am so glad I did. We had such a good time. The seats are TINY, but this really doesn't matter because you're standing 90% of the time anyway. The energy in the stadium is unrivaled and all of the staff we encountered during the game were incredibly friendly. GO BLUE!"
3275,Date of experience: September 2016,22-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Go Blue!,"Always a great day for football! Shuttle service is excellent, and the drivers tops! Have to plan early for tickets and accommodations the same weekend."
3276,Date of experience: September 2016,22-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Organized Mayhem!,"What fun! Over 110,000 fans in one place. Parking outside is EXPENSIVE. the golf course across the street was $50.  Many people tailgating. There are other alternatives, like shuttle buses. LOTS of stairs, and also handicapped areas for those who can't make those.  A good variety of food, drink, and fan souvenirs. Great day."
3277,Date of experience: October 2015,22-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,3,It's big alright. But it's overrated.,We have visited several times.  Football Saturdays are a zoo.  The seats are tight.  The home crowd is not welcoming.  Getting in and out can be daunting with children.  There are better places to experience a Big Ten football game.
3278,Date of experience: September 2016,21-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,No Place Better,"What can you say? It's the biggest and the best. Besides my impartiality as a UM fan it really is a great stadium. When it's filled with 110,000 fans the place is electric. There are 2 big scoreboard / replay screens, one at each end of the stadium to easily see the close ups of the action in front of you. The concourse is cool and comfortable when it's hot and provides shelter from the elements. It does get crowded at halftime as you might expect. Plenty of entry gates so getting in goes fairly quickly. Truly an experience every fan should try no matter what your allegiance. A tip: Row 73 is the level of the tunnels to the concourse. Plan accordingly about the amount of steps you want to walm up or down."
3280,Date of experience: September 2016,19-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House - Go Blue!,There nothing quite like a Saturday football game in the Big House! I've had the opportunity to attend quite a few games over the passed 20+ years and it's always thrilling.
3282,Date of experience: September 2016,19-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Greatest place to see football on planet earth,"Even if you are not a big football fall it is worth coming here to see a game. The largest stadium in the US that consistently hosts crowds over 100,000 people & really doesn't have a bad seat in the house. The atmosphere is amazing! #GoBlue"
3283,Date of experience: September 2016,18-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,What an experience!,"If you are visiting town, catching a game at ""The Big House"" has to be on your list.  What an experience. The crowd is HUGE and full of energy. You won't ever forget a game watched here live!"
3284,Date of experience: September 2016,16-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House Better than We Could Expect,"OK, so one of the families we were with is from Columbus Oh. so they were all about that other place.  Well, the Big House looks enormous on TV but is actually BIGGER in real life.  It is way past impressive.  Because of a connection we got to see some extras of the facilities like strength training and physical rehab area.  OMG no wonder it costs so much to go to a major school.  We did not go to a game but that did not take anything away from the stadium experience."
3285,Date of experience: September 2016,14-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Go Blue,We had so much fun!! There is no place like the Big House! We cannot wait to come back for another game! Go Blue!!
3286,Date of experience: September 2016,13-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Best Day Ever!!!,Best stadium to watch college football. A must for any sports fan. A terrific experience. No alcohol is served in the stadium but the tailgating was stellar. Go Blue!!
3287,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Best place for Michigan Football!,"The excitement in the Big House is electrifying, no matter the opponent. The stadium is 3/4 underground and has a great view no matter where you are sitting -thanks to the large screens at each end of the field. I've had seats in the end zone and while that does not offer good views of the action on the field, I ended up watching the action from the screen. My preference is to have seats from the corner and sidelines, avoiding the end zones. I also prefer sitting higher up so I can get the overview, but I was pleasantly surprised that I could enjoy the game even when I had 'bad' seats. You can't miss when you're in the Big House. Go Blue!"
3288,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Football game,"Coming from Canada to watch a game here can be a bit surreal. We don't see 100,000 people at any pro sport much less college or university sporting events.Going to a game at the ""Big house"" should be on any sports nut bucket list."
3289,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House is the Best!,"I am never tired of seeing Michigan Stadium.  Even if you don't attend a game, try to make a point to visit this piece of history. Driving into town the night prior to a game, we drove past and the stadium is lit and looks gorgeous.  Attend a game and you are in for a thrill as over 107,000 fill the stands.  It is an engineering marvel in how easily people flow in and out. No seat is bad. Jumbo television screens make sure you don't miss a thing. Love this place."
3290,Date of experience: September 2016,11-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Great Big House,"Always a unique great day to watch a great college football game, the big house should be experienced by all fans.  New improvements with more covered areas, better washrooms (no more troughs), better concessions which could be improved, no alcohol is sold which makes it much more of a family event, I rarely see a drunk, a friendly great day.  GO BLUE"
3291,Date of experience: September 2016,11-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,A MUST for all college football fans!!,"Michigan football and their fans never disappoint.  The experience is like no other I have been to.  There is really not a bad seat in the house.  The University also opens up their golf course for tailgating, only a short walk to the stadium, well worth the $40 you have to pay."
3292,Date of experience: September 2016,11-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Go Blue!,There is no place better than the BIG HOUSE! It's mecca and I cannot wait to come back for another game! GO BLUE!
3293,Date of experience: September 2016,10-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Bighouse,"I had not been to Michigan Stadium since before the two remodels. It only holds 111,000 people now. Entrance and exits are easily accessible, nice areas for handicapped people and plenty of restrooms and concessions to make your game day experience an enjoyable one."
3294,Date of experience: September 2016,10-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Great atmosphere and history for a ball game,"Not our 1st time here but always a great visit.  It's an amazing site to take in, sitting with 110,000+ fans.  The amenities are well spaced.  Security was smooth and efficient.  We parked down town and walked.  The walk was cool as well, the main street closed off so the crowd had breathing room."
3295,Date of experience: September 2016,8-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House,"Took in the first game of the season. A blow out as Michigan whomped Hawaii. A Spectacle. Huge ( 110,000 plus)stadium filled to capacity even for this not very competitive game. THE marching band. Fanatic fans. Really noisy. Expect to stand up since the guy in front of you will be pretty much the whole game.Stadium amenities, restrooms Etc excellent"
3296,Date of experience: September 2016,7-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,It certainly is the Big house!,"Despite its size, the logistics and service at the stadium is great!  Plenty of food & drink, bathrooms and security.  Do not try to take a bag, they will make you check everything that doesn't fit in your pocket.  The city of Ann Arbor runs a shuttle to and from the stadium from most of the nearby hotels that drops you right in front of the stadium.  Cost is $1.50 each way!  Plenty of buses and you don't wait very long in line.  A much better option than trying to park.  GO BLUE!!"
3297,Date of experience: September 2016,7-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,A College Football Institution,The atmosphere at a Michigan is awesome.  The tailgating scene is one of the best in the country both by the amount of people having a tailgating party and all of the food and drinks.  The experience of the game is something you have to experience as a college football fan.  Any serious college football fan must make it to the Big House once in their life.
3298,Date of experience: September 2016,7-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,WOW!,"I had always watched games from the ""Big House"", but this was my first time to see a game there. We saw Michigan vs Hawaii.  The game was not much, but the experience was fantastic. Traffic is tough (with 107,000 people). We parked at the tennis center and walked down the golf course.  We were in row 20 and had a great view. Concession and restroom lines were long, but the atmosphere was second to none."
3299,Date of experience: November 2015,7-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Surprise!,"This stadium looks as if it is not so tall, but inside you can see that it goes deep into the ground. It seats over 100,000.  It's just so exciting to be with all those people hoping for a victory. For an alumni, all the history and tradition of the school is exemplified in this facility."
3300,Date of experience: September 2016,5-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,My yearly pilgrimage and first visit for my girlfriend,"I make a point to attending a game or two a year and this time, my girlfriend and I described to have a Labor Day weekend blowout.Saturday's weather was perfect, attendees sitting around us were behaved, the weather was perfect, and the Wolverines took care of business.Overall, my girlfriend had no idea what she had been missing out on all this time."

3304,Date of experience: September 2016,4-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Awesome,Watching a game at the University of Michigan is pure delight.  Parkingon game days is $40-50 close by with parking in State Street garages a bit lower.
3305,Date of experience: September 2016,3-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,FOOTBALL!!!!,"For those who need back support during long games / events, keep in mind that the stadium uses bleachers, not individual seats. Anyway, great venue. The audience takes advantage of the large space and chants incessantly for as long as the game still matters. If you can score a game of worthy competition (and perhaps tickets that will not inflate to a week's pay), this could be a rowdy experience."
3306,Date of experience: October 2015,31-Aug-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Best place to be on a fall Saturday!,"If you haven't been to the big house you haven't lived!! There are great foods, drinks and snacks! The stadium is huge but trust me it's a small feel once you're inside with all the Michigan fans! Traffic is crazy in this small town. Come early and enjoy the opportunity to GO BLUE!!"

3309,Date of experience: October 2015,23-Aug-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Great Football,"Even if you are not a Michigan fan (which would be crazy) this is a great stadium to visit just for the atmosphere.  The seating is very crowded, definitely made for teenage butts!!"

Can you say Notre Dame at night?  Still a little volume deprived, but better with the new boxes on both sides of the field"
3312,Date of experience: September 2015,21-Aug-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,"Michigan Stadium, ""The Big House""","I have been a huge Michigan fan for a long time and I am now even going to Michigan's Dearborn Campus. I love the Big House during games. Its exciting, loud, and a great atmosphere for watching a game! Seating is bench style to accommodate over 100,000 for every game. Yes it can be uncomfortable if you are sitting by the wrong person. Other than that, I just enjoyed watching a game. Concessions have basic food you would find anywhere else, price is well...expensive, like many amusement parks and sporting events...Parking is not great. You need to walk or get a bus/taxi if you really want to get a cheap spot, but I found it not to be a huge issue walking through campus. All in all its a nice stadium for a game."

My son has a friend whose father has great season seats we were able to use (many thanks Bill). We sat on the 50 years line, west side above the student section. These ""high priced"" seats are more a movie theater style ascend worth it. It rained a bit but a good time was had by all because as usual this year, U of M won."
3315,Date of experience: October 2015,17-Aug-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Big House,The finest stadium in the country. there is not a bad seat in the entire stadium.To aoid the sun in your eyes you should sit on the west side of the stadium.
3318,Date of experience: August 2016,10-Aug-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,3,Meh. If you are not into sports not worth it.,The stadium is pretty but only so-so. It gets very crowded during the games. There's also hardly anywhere to park and parking is expensive. Unless you really want to see a game I would not recommend
3319,Date of experience: August 2016,7-Aug-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Went for the soccer game,We made our first trip to the big house and loved it.  I can't imagine what it must be like to see Michigan play there.  The stadium seemed modern and well maintained.  I really enjoyed seeing some of the historical plaques displayed around the facility.
3321,Date of experience: November 2015,5-Aug-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,My review,This stadium is a piece of art:) my husband and I went to a game last year.  It was amazing a little cold but the crowd made it warm.  it's a must see even if you are not into sports:)
3326,Date of experience: August 2016,3-Aug-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,One word. Amazing.,"Just went for the champions cup with my team Real Madrid facing Chelsea. Even though many key players for Madrid weren't playing (Ronaldo because of his injury, Bale, Benzema etc.) it was still electric. 105,000+ people in a college football stadium in unreal to see. Everything about the game was great and I could not say one bad thing about the venue (except the security, but of course it is to be expected with so many people around). LOVED IT!!!"
3328,Date of experience: October 2015,2-Aug-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Well it's big,They don't call it the Big House for nothing. It's quite an experience going to see a football game there and I highly recommend it even if you are not a fan. Go Blue!
3334,Date of experience: September 2015,26-Jul-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House,"This outstanding sports venue in addition to being the home of the Michigan Wolverines has hosted world class soccer; special hockey events, graduation ceremonies, and special events for families. Special seating for groups available."
3335,Date of experience: October 2015,26-Jul-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Largest college football stadium,For over 50 years I have enjoyed attending football games at the Michigan Stadium. The stadium is also used for University commencements and occasional major soccer and ice hockey games.
3337,Date of experience: August 2015,25-Jul-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,1,No fun,Seats are tiny. Everyone's drunk. Been there once in the 30 years I lived here.Etc. etc. etc.etc.etc.
3338,Date of experience: November 2015,24-Jul-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Photo Opportunities,"Michigan Stadium is one of the most iconic and identifiable sports venues in the world.  The first game I saw at Michigan Stadium was on November 13, 1976 vs. Illinois at 10 years of age.  I was one of the 104,107 fans at that game who witnessed former Michigan great Rob Lytle break the all-time Michigan rushing record.Today, I work for my own media business shooting photos of Michigan Football on home gamedays.I have been asked many times by friends, some who are season ticket holders and others first-time game attendees, to offer up some examples of things to shoot in/around the stadium.  I offer up a few of my suggestions for you below.Exterior of the stadium    Head to Gate 8 at the northwest corner.  Just inside the gate is a bronze wolverine statue.  At just the right angle, you can get the wolverine, the pine trees and the block M on the back side of the north video board all in the same shot.    The northwest tower of the west sideline structure.  Look for the stairs immediately south of Gate 8.  Depending on the placement of concession stands on the lower concourse, the area between Gate 8 and the aforementioned stairs is my pick for the best shot of any of the four towers.  It puts the size of the building in perspective of the surroundings.  You may need to wait to be let into the stadium before you can take an unobstructed photo of said view.    On the north end, Gate 9.  A clear shot of the block M on the back side of the north video board.    Gate 1, east sideline, the tunnel.  This is a very popular location.    By 6:00 p.m., from Section 1 left stairway (at the tunnel), watch the players and coaches arrive to the stadium locker room. Gates to Michigan Stadium open at this time also. I recommend walking in immediately after watching the team arrive.Interior of the stadium    Enter stadium at Gate 1 and begin taking in the enormity of the new construction on the East side. Note the old art deco style ??michigan stadium?? letters (all lower case) over Section 1 entrance into the bowl straight ahead. These letters, and the corresponding letters over Section 23 entrance on the West side, came from atop the former press box.    Take a peek inside the bowl from Section 1 or Section 44. While there, note the section of chair back seats at midfield at the top of the bowl on the opposite side. That area is the footprint of the former press box. Note the spatial differences between the location of the old press box and the new sideline structure.    Heading back out of the seating bowl to the concourse, walk from one end of the East lower concourse to the other, noting the signage of former Michigan greats along the outer wall. At the Southeast corner of the lower concourse is a display of the Michigan High School Football Coaches Association Wall of Fame.    By way of the north end or the south end, walk around to the west side of the stadium. Along the way take in the special inlaid bricks at each of the four corners (entrance gates) of the stadium and the corresponding ??plazas??.    On the west side, note the shields mounted on the exterior wall of the lower concourse identifying each of Michigan??s 11 national championship teams.    Again, above Section 23 entrance, note the ??michigan stadium?? letters.    My selection for TOP PHOTO-OP: From either the southwest tower or the northwest tower of the west sideline structure, take the public stairway to the upper concourse. It is the ONLY space from within either sideline structure available to the public. This space, being above the last row of seats in the bowl, provides a vantage point of the stadium never before available to fans.  Be sure to take in the breathtaking view at the northwest end (above student section) of downtown Ann Arbor.  It is exceptional!    When matriculating from one end of the upper concourse to the other, you will want to take the path around the back side of the concessions (closest toward Main Street).  Be sure to take in the view of what is at this point in the evening a closed Main Street."
3339,Date of experience: November 2015,24-Jul-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,"Cramped, but fun","This is not the most comfortable stadium. Most of the seats are on metal bleachers and you don't get much space. Your knees are pressed into the person in front of you, and someone else's knees are pressed into your back. But it's so much fun being there on game day. There are plenty of food options, but expensive like any stadium venue. Bathrooms are adequate. Parking is crazy, but we take one of the buses that's offered from the Plymouth Rd. Park & Ride. Much cheaper and easier."

3343,Date of experience: October 2015,16-Jul-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,1,One of the Worst College Stadiums,"Literally one of the worst college stadiums I have ever visited. The seats are extremely small, the concessions are basically open to the elements. The atmosphere is strange and negative at best. Will not return for another game."
3344,Date of experience: October 2015,27-Jun-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,An Ann Arbor Legend!,"There's no denying that Michigan Stadium is the biggest draw in Ann Arbor on a fall day. I'm not a football fan but I do enjoy all the pageantry surrounding 'game day' in Ann Arbor. One frustration: if you don't come early, someone else will be sitting in your seats and the ushers simply won't remove them. Very disappointing for season ticket-holders!"
3347,Date of experience: October 2015,14-Jun-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Very exciting experience,Lots of fun and spirit during football season. Usually jam packed. Great experience going to the largest college football stadium in the world!!

But you'll sit with the person in front of you between your knees. The person behind you has a knee in your back. Last time I was there, I kept hitting the kid beside me with my elbow when we cheered. They sell about 1/3 more seats than they should, but that's the economics of college football."
3350,Date of experience: September 2015,4-Jun-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Game day in Ann Arbour is a blast,"Travelling to the US, I wanted to experience American sports. Surprised by the high prices of the professional leagues we looked into college sports and found that our route would bring us close to ""The Big House"", Ann Arbour, MI, home of the Michigan University Wolverines football team on game day. With more than 108 000 fans at the match (equivalent to 90% of the population of Ann Arbour) this was the full experience. The match lasted for hours, but it was never boring. I do not wish European sports to be transformed into this madness, but it was a fabulous spectacle to witness with the school band and cheerleaders holding a constant show when the football was not in full action. Simply walking to the game was an attraction worth seeing with the whole city getting ready for the game by walking to the match and arranging tail gate parties outside the stadium."
3355,Date of experience: September 2015,10-May-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Great September football Saturday,The town overflows with football fever and spirit. The streets and parking lots are full of maize and blue decked out fans. A great environment to experience a uniquely American event.

It's an all day event with tailgating and the game, but it's definitely worth it.  I would recommend it to all football fans."

Over the years I've had the opportunity to have tickets at many angles around the field, and I have yet to have a bad angle. Everything inside is easily accessible, even in crowds; event staff handle large numbers quickly and easily. If you haven't been here before to see a game, I'd encourage you to go!"

Ann Arbor is the quintessential college town. Worth a visit even if you have no connection to the school.

It was our first (and probably the last) time there at the stadium. The day before it was a ghost town. On the day of the game the town comes to live! We joint hundreds of people for the walk-in, the excitement build up was incredible."
3375,Date of experience: September 2015,6-Mar-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,"Always a great visit, most seats are great",Went with my son and father in Sept2015 when playing unlv. Sat in sec 44 which is visitor side but in row 25 I believe and were great seats. Usually I go 1-2 times a year and the best seats are between the 20 yard lines rows 7-40. I have sat as low as row 2 but you are so close to the field it is harder to see plays develop so I recommend sitting up a little further. Great crowd and food to be had. Parking can be a pain but I generally park on a street at someone's house and walk 15-20 minutes to get to the stadium and chat with other fans when walking.

Arrive early and spend some time perusing bookstores, visit a caf?? or musemum or just people watch. Then make your way to the stadium for the game at the BIG HOUSE. We like to park downtown and walk to the stadium. The walk is easy and the vibe of massive numbers of students, fans, alumni(ae), etc. Then after the game go to dinner or (weather permitting) site outside at a caf?? and relax. Ann Arbor is awesome. Hi Blue!"

3381,Date of experience: October 2015,12-Feb-16,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,There is no better stadium to visit,"I grew up in this stadium so maybe I am biased but I don't think so.  I have visited a lot of college and pro stadiums and this is still my favorite.  What makes it unique is that it is one bowl that seats over 100,000 people and even the top row has a great view.  In comparison, Ohio State has 3 levels and once you are in their B or C decks, I would rather watch the game on television because you are too far away to fell like a part of the action.  Pro stadiums are often indoors with a totally different feel.  Without a doubt, experience this stadium on a nice fall day when the Wolverines are playing and you won't forget it!"

In the last few years I just gave up my season tickets and get a 3 pack of tickets in different sections.  It is nice to check out different sections of the stadium for different views.  In the last few years I have gotten tickets in sections 43 and 44; I have really enjoyed these.  Great view and calm easy going crowd.

With the new rebuild it finally has some character instead of being a hole in the ground. Parking is avg while traffic is rough at best. Stadium food is so so while the 3rd party vendors are much better. Crowd is classy and kid friendly. They do not serve alcohol. Seating is bench seating just as most college stadiums (sucks!). Not a bad seat in the place. The worst thing,by far, is that alot of fans want to stand WAY too much. If you take kids under 12 and want them to be able to see the game, forget it. After going to road games and various NFL stadiums it puts the big house in perspective. While I will always love my wolverines,  their gameday experience is avg at best."

There is not a bad seat to be had and you'll end up with over 100,000 of your closest friends!  The atmosphere is electric, especially now that the Wolverines are showing up to play again.  If you're planning on coming to a game, but don't have a ticket, don't worry, there are always hawkers on the streets close to the stadium.  Be careful when buying, there are a lot of people milling around and you MUST hold your money tightly, or find a quieter place, in public viewing areas, to make your transaction.  Expect to pay close to $100 for each ticket.The food inside is typical stadium food, nothing to write home about, but filling and EXPENSIVE.  The vendors inside the stadium bowl are just the worst, often run out of food and drink, often staffed by rude young thugs.  Buy your food outside, much better."

GO BLUE"

Team finally knows how to play football. Concessions are fresh and reasonable and there really isn't a bad seat in the house. Also love the area in and around Ann Arbor. A great place for a college event. Their baseball stadium, hockey arena and basketball arena also are excellent with knowledgable ushers who are kind and helpful and ticket prices are okay."

3408,Date of experience: November 2015,19-Nov-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Football game,The people working there were extremely pleasant and helpful. With no columns everyone gets a great view. In addition the extra large scoreboards at each end of the stadium shows a replay of all plays so you don't miss anything. Like most stadiums they crowd you in. Overall a great experience.
3409,Date of experience: November 2015,19-Nov-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Always a great time at the Big House!,"We love attending games at the Big House. Parking can be a nightmare if you are from out of town and are not sure where you are going. You can park for free on the streets, but make sure it is a not a tow zone, you arrive early and be prepared to walk. There is a lot to do in Ann Arbor before the games. Getting into the game is pretty easy if you go in about an hour ahead of time. The closer to game time the busier it gets. No bags or water bottles. Once in the stadium there are plenty of bathrooms. They are usually clean and well stocked. The food is very overpriced like most stadiums so I suggest eating before hand. Once you walk into the Big House you just have a feeling of aww. It is huge! There aren't any obstructed views and all seats are great. The seats are on the smaller side. Make friends with your neighbors and enjoy the game. Exiting the game can be a pain especially the closer your seats are to the field. Leaving Ann Arbor is a huge pain after the game. Best to get a drink or hangout for a while after. If not, patience are a must. Go Blue!!!"

Be advised..many rules about prohibited items including bags, purses and water bottles.  Refreshments inside are premium priced, so eat before you come.  Michigan fans are pretty nice, so unless away fans are really obnoxious, expect courtesy from the Maize and Blue.  Nothing like watching football with 109,000 singularly focused people.

3416,Date of experience: November 2015,11-Nov-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,3,Attended Michigan Football game.,"Crowd was huge, some time spent queuing to get thru gates. Long lines for refreshments.  I found it hard to maneuver around in such a large crowd.  Half time activities were entertaining.  Seating is all benches, not the level of comfort in other newer stadiums or like professional venues."
3417,Date of experience: November 2015,10-Nov-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House,"There is no place like Michigan Stadium on a football Saturday. Great atmosphere for a game, history and tradition. The pregame band performance featuring The Victors never gets old. And the pregame video narrated by James Earl Jones gives you chills. Be warned; all seating is bleacher style. Go Blue!"
3418,Date of experience: November 2015,9-Nov-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House is the perfect place to be on a sunny fall afternoon!,"This is probably one of the best places in the country to watch a college sports event (the Rose Bowl in Pasadena is probably the best, in my opinion). In any case, we were here to watch the Michigan vs. Rutgers game as a part of UofM Parent Weekend. My son sat in the student section (across the stadium from us) and mom, dad and grandma had very good seats on the 40 yard line. We visited the restroom immediately upon entering the stadium, before the lines got too long. We also ate lunch right before the game, so we did not deal with the long lines for concessions. They did have a couple of interesting options aside from the university issued hot dogs and popcorn. My son had a pulled pork sandwich from one of the food stands and he said it was very good. The burrito cart looked pretty good, too. Once inside the stadium we quickly found our seats, however, there was a lot of confusion with the guy in front of us and a man who wanted his seat. . Here is the down side to the Big House, the numbered seats are SMALL. So, make friends with the people sitting next to you as you are watching the game almost cheek to cheek with them for the next few hours. We had one extra ticket (which should have equaled an extra seat (ie. more room)). However, last minute a couple and their college age daughter came barreling into our row and shoved their three bodies in, with the two tickets that they bought. Two tickets, three people. You do the math. If our son ended up sitting with us, we would have had a problem. Who does that anyhow? Well, I guess a lot of people do as the ticket people do not really ever check your ticket or your seat. The Wolverines won big and we had a fantastic time, but left after half time as once the sun set it got very cold."

3421,Date of experience: October 2015,2-Nov-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Best college stadium,Nothing better than the big house. They could probably add more restrooms...there's always a long line when there's a game.
3422,Date of experience: October 2015,28-Oct-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,What can I say that hasn't already been said?,"The Big House is a great experience on a fall Saturday. I flew in from Arizona for the Northwestern game so tailgating was out. I would strongly recommend that any Michigan football fan check out the new Towsley Museum at Schembechler Hall. I've been to a number of Michigan football games, and this was the highlight of my trip. If you want to get the full game day experience, get downtown early and have lunch and some drinks at Ashleys, then walk north to the stadium and check out the crazy frat houses in full swing and finish at the Towsley museum before heading into the game. If you get to the stadium early enough you might even catch the marching band playing outside! Go Blue!"

We attended the game in memory of our son who passed in June, 2015.  He was avid Michigan fan and supported the university.  He had purchased season tickets before his death.  We have given tickets to friends, but decided to attend this one.  I will say everyone from the fans to the workers were very nice and helpful."

3425,Date of experience: September 2015,25-Oct-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House is The Best House,"We've been attending Michigan football games since we were freshmen in 1964.  The stadium has been enlarged and greatly improved over the years.  There's not a bad seat in the house...no obstructed view seats, and those in wheelchairs now have great seating with easy access. Food and bottled water are significantly overpriced, but that's typical at sports venues.  You can't take in any sort of bag (even binocular cases) for security reasons these days...it all has to go in your pockets, so be prepared.  The band and the spectacle of over 100,000 fans at every game can't be beat anywhere in the country.  Go Blue!"
3426,Date of experience: December 2014,24-Oct-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,It is called the Big House for a reason.,"I try to attend at least one game a year at Michigan Stadium.  You and 110,000 of your fellow football fan get to enjoy a day in the elements cheering on the Maize and Blue.  Get to the game early to enjoy tailgating at the golf course.  Then head to the stadium early to see the band enter the stadium.  Recent updates with new big screens and improvements in facilities make the day more enjoyable.  Seating is tight and aluminum benches so bring a bleacher pad (or pick one up at on main street at the M Den).  I recommend a visit to Zingerman's Deli to round out your Ann Arbor Day."
3427,Date of experience: October 2015,23-Oct-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,1,Third world,"Good luck doing anything here.  Granted there is more room since the overhaul, but amazingly that gets eaten up by the clientele.  The road in front of the stadium is EMBARRASSING, full of holes and chunks missing FOR YEARS.  They literally spent all this money on the stadium facia and put NOTHING into the road.  You will have to pay $20 or more to park and attend a game.  There is no ""game"" parking for customers provided by the stadium or the university.  Nope, you will have to pay a local to park in their yard.  You might as well because you aren't going to be able and drive around to find more/better parking due to the traffic (until the game starts).  The truly great part of game day is shopping in an empty grocery store, devoid of the drunken idiots that tear up your town that seems to have little to no city planning outside of million dollar condos.  They only want your money folks.  There are many other places to send your entitled kids and plastic money-I would suggest looking into other states and institutions."

It had been a few years since we have been to the big house and all I can say it is better than ever.  All the new renovations are outstanding.  There is not a better place in the world to see a college football game, and there are no better fans than Michigan fans."

3430,Date of experience: October 2015,18-Oct-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Great College Football Experience,"My 12 year old daughter and I made the trip to AA to cheer for our beloved Northwestern Wildcats. Despite the blowout loss, I have to admit we enjoyed the experience and wish we could have a similar home field advantage.The stadium seats over 110,000 and there are not many bad seats in the house. It's a bit of a hassle to enter into the stadium due to the sheer volume of fans. Nonetheless, we loved visiting. These recommendations are only based on 1 game so please take them with a grain of salt. Recommendations are written for visitors who don't have a connection to the university and are visiting for the first time.1. Get there early. It's pretty easy to park if you get there a few hours before kickoff and are willing to pay at least $30. There's a lot to see in the area on campus and in the surrounding environs.2. There's ample food for purchase. You can get food at the restaurants on State Street and there are also some stands selling pizzas and sausages on Hoover Street.3. If you want to drink before the game, I'd recommend picking up a six pack or two from a 7-Eleven or other delis on the drive in. You can set up shop on Elbel Field or one of the paid parking lots in the area and just blend in.4. Bathrooms. There are lots of porta-potties in the areas around the stadium. Easy to take care of business if you don't mind using those. Once inside, the facilities are pretty expansive relative to other stadiums I have visited. No complaints here.5. Michigan fans are overall pretty friendly and welcoming to visitors. Perhaps it's because we are Northwestern fans, they see us as pretty harmless...6. Traffic is not great after the game. Police direct the traffic to major arteries, which cause backups. Use a traffic app like Waze and it will save you a half hour or so.7. The band marches into the stadium on Hoover, I believe, about an hour before the game. The Michigan band is world class and it is worth seeing them.This is a fun experience on a beautiful Fall day, even if you don't bring home a victory. I will do that some day and can't wait to visit again. Go Cats!"

3433,Date of experience: October 2015,13-Oct-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Go Blue!,"Love coming to football games at the Big House, the atmosphere is great and it's always fun to watch Michigan football!"
3434,Date of experience: October 2015,12-Oct-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Your Experience Depends...,"If you have a son/daughter at the University of Michigan, you're going to love your visit to The Big House. If you are just in town and want to catch a game, you might not feel that way. The stadium hold 110,000 people in a single deck configuration. In other words, there are no upper or lower decks. Parking is a bear and a fortune around the stadium at $50.00. Traffic getting in and out takes forever as well. However, if you have a reason to be there, there is something magical about this stadium when it is full (which it ALWAYS is). The traditions that go on are heartwarming and the crowd is intelligent and very respectful of visitors supporting the opponent. There are a lot of concessions so getting something to eat and drink is not a problem which is quite an accomplishment given the number of people. The views of the field are all unobstructed and actually quite good even if you are not close. Mobile phone signal is sketchy if you are close to the field because the field is actually below ground level. Bottom line though, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves."
3435,Date of experience: October 2015,12-Oct-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Outstanding college game expierience.,"No matter who's side your a fan of it's a great experience. Traffic, parking, restrooms have been vastly upgraded since I last attended a game there."
3436,Date of experience: October 2015,11-Oct-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Great college venue!!,"We're traveled to many arenas but Michigan Stadium is truly an impressive venue. The size of the crowd and the history of the stadium make it a special trip. Unfortunately our team, Northwestern, got smoked but the crowd was friendly. I bought tickets on stubhub and we were able to get close to the action. If you get the chance, go see a game there!"
3437,Date of experience: September 2015,9-Oct-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Great Place,"The stands are closer to the field than many places. So, if you can get a decent ticket fairly, you are really close to the action.  I sat in the end zone row 25 and was pleased that you are really close to the field. The giant screen helps when the play is at the other end."
3438,Date of experience: October 2015,6-Oct-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,GO BLUE!!,"Great venue for all sports, super energizing, very accessible, I am in a wheelchair and the viewing and assistance is first rate, I have had season tickets for 15+ years."
3439,Date of experience: September 2015,4-Oct-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,HAIL!!  to the Big House!!!!     One of a kind..........,"Breathtaking!!!  is all I can say, each time I enter this impressive structure.   It is a Must-see for ALL fans (or non-fans) of UM football, as it is the largest Stadium in the United States, holding well over 100,000 people on HomeGame days.   Empty, it is an Engineering marvel;  but noting compares with the sights and sounds of the Stadium on Game day.   It is a mass of color and noise and activity;   there is so much more to watch and enjoy, even if you are not into the game!    The concessions may be a bit pricey, but there are small venues set up all around the Stadium on Game days, for those who tire of the game, and want to do a little Maize & Blue shopping.   It is indescribable, so IF given the opportunity to see it for yourself, take it!    Everyone should see the inside of the Stadium at least once in their lives!"
3440,Date of experience: September 2015,3-Oct-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,The Big House Rocks,"Watching a football game at Michigan Stadium is a great experience. The Wolverines put on a great show. The stadium is well run: polite ushers. There is nothing like being part of the crowd of 109,000 people. Oh, and don't miss the band!"
3441,Date of experience: September 2015,3-Oct-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Michigan Win and Sunny Day in the Stadium,"We had an enjoyable time at the Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor.  Michigan won the game and the weather was great.  The staff at the stadium were very helpful when we were looking for our seats.  The crowd, cheerleaders, and band had great school spirit.  We found parking near the stadium in front of someone's house.  It's about $20 - 50 in cash depending where you can find parking.  If you have a car it's best to take an early shuttle to the stadium which is only a few dollars and can be purchases at some Ann Arbor hotels.  The lines for the food is very long during half time so it's best to go at another time during the game."
3442,Date of experience: September 2015,1-Oct-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House,The Big House was simply amazing!!!!! It is nicer than a lot of Pro Stadiums. You can feel the energy as soon as you step inside.
3443,Date of experience: September 2015,30-Sep-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Amazing Fans!,"We have never been to THE BIG HOUSE! It has earned that name well.  We were completely decked out in our UNLV gear, a large group of us were tailgating.  My husband wanted to walk around the golf course of Michigan tailgaters, we were easily outnumbered, but the crowd was great!  So friendly, thanked us for coming, and even offered us shots!  In the Stadium it was the same.  The Student Section takes ""The Wave"" to a whole new level!!!! Thats all I will say, you will have to go see for yourself."
3444,Date of experience: September 2015,30-Sep-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,This is home!,Best game day experience.  Clean bathrooms! There is not a bad seat in the stadium. We love the indoor premium seating and amenities!  My husband requires special assistance and every single employee that sees us asks if we are ok or is there is anything they can do to help. Simply the best. Go Blue!
3445,Date of experience: September 2015,30-Sep-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House is quite grand,Its the Big House what other rating could it possibly get.  As a former graduate I hadn't been here since the additions and it made a classic become even more classy.  Truly one of the gems of the football world and a game is a must see if you are there on a football weekend.
3446,Date of experience: September 2015,30-Sep-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,LOVE the big house and ALL of its 10 milllion steps,was at the M vs BYU game - SHUTOUT!!!only compliant is that our section did not have stair railings and we had to go up and down 70+ steps each time to use the restroom. my grandmother had a really tough time not having something to grip while tackling all of those stairs BUT we will be back again. best atmosphere. so much fun! #go blue
3447,Date of experience: November 2014,30-Sep-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Best college football stadium,"By far, the best college football stadium in the US. Seats almost 110,000 people in a bowl shaped stadium that is dug down into the ground. All those people lead to a very vibrant experience. The school spirit here has got to be the tops of anywhere. If you want to see a college football game and have the best experience you can, then you must see one in Michigan Stadium."
3448,Date of experience: September 2015,29-Sep-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,It is the BIG HOUSE!,"First and foremost... get there early! The experience is amazing. The people, the game and the food. There is not a bad seat in the Big Hoise"
3449,Date of experience: September 2015,29-Sep-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Finally made it to the Big House,"Fantastic stadium.  I was surprised at the great viewing from the nosebleed section (we were literally the highest row), we had a clear view of everything.  Good crowd, very safe and orderly."
3450,Date of experience: September 2015,29-Sep-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,3,"Large Stadium, Expensive Food","We were in town for a Michigan game and the stadium is absolutely amazing. The field is down in the ground so when you walk into the arena, you are actually on like the 70th row and then you walk down the aisle to your seats. The people were super friendly even though we were routing for the opposing team. The food was okay but expensive in my opinion. One time fillable souvenir cup of soda cost $10. That was stupid, considering that at many other stadiums, including Ford Field, you can get a souvenir cup that's refillable for $8. It didn't really make sense but the people were nice. I was also frustrated that they have tents outside the stadium where they sell shirts, jackets, etc. and so we bought a michigan football only to be told at the gates, that we couldn't take it into the stadium because it was a projectile. Meanwhile, in the stadium, they sell the same footballs at the store inside and so how they justify it not being a projectile when it's purchased inside the stadium versus outside doesn't make any sense. I was frustrated that they didn't tell us that when we were buying the football outside. Just seems like a silly thing. Parking is another issue altogether. There just isn't enough parking and so the prices are astronomical. Plan on paying between $25 - $50 for parking. I have never paid $50 for parking but we did this time, because my father in law was with us and we needed handicapped parking and it was across the stadium but they charge $50. That was a bit ridiculous in my mind. We still loved the stadium and the game but those other issues gave us a sour taste and I don't see us coming back for future games."
3451,Date of experience: September 2015,29-Sep-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Bucket list experience,"It's the Big House, what more is there to say? Beautiful stadium, great fans, great team! I love that there are no advertisements to be found anywhere inside the stadium. Just a sea of maize and blue! Whether or not you're a Michigan fan, if you love college sports, this is a must-see stadium!"
3452,Date of experience: September 2015,28-Sep-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Awesome stadium,"The NFL really needs to take notes on how to do a stadium right!  Over 108,000 people in attendance and no bathroom lines, no fighting, pushing, etc.  The food lines were a little long during halftime, but to be expected.  Well thought out with the design.  If you go, tailgate at the golf course.  $40/car to park, but it is the place to tailgate!  The people were fantastic, lots of clean porto potties.  A short 10 minute walk to the stadium on a paved walkway."
3453,Date of experience: September 2015,28-Sep-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Great for UM games,Loved the BYU game this weekend!  can't wait to go back for the Rutgers game in November.  See you there!

3456,Date of experience: September 2015,22-Sep-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Great Stadium!  Go Blue!,"I am a Michigan Football fan and season ticket holder so my review may be biased.  However, I have attended many other college and professional sporting events and truly believe the Big House is a must see if you are a sports fan.  It's a beautiful stadium with great facilities, concessions and shopping (The M Den) and is very well kept.  If nothing else, when else do you get the chance to sit with 108,000 people.  There isn't a bad seat in the house.  GO BLUE!"
3458,Date of experience: September 2015,21-Sep-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Great Place,Rain or shine a Saturday at the Big House is not to be missed. We had both. If you enjoy a tailgate the golf course is a lot of fun. The band always takes my breath away. The atmosphere was wonderful and we found some gems at the M-Den.
3459,Date of experience: September 2015,21-Sep-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Well Done!!,"Go Blue - What a great atmosphere on gameday!!!  I'm also very impressed at how they have directed traffic post game.  In previous years, we have waited a long time to get back home, this time it was quick and easy!  Go Blue!"
3460,Date of experience: September 2015,20-Sep-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House!,Attended my first game at The Big House and loved it. Stadium is huge but is easy to get around. Staff was great and friendly. PS: they won!!
3461,Date of experience: September 2015,20-Sep-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Awesome!,"Nothing makes me feel the way I do on a Saturday in September when I walk into the Big House, hear the Michigan Marching Band play and watch the team take the field. It's a not-too-miss experience."
3463,Date of experience: September 2015,13-Sep-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Big House Big Thrill,"Really enjoy opening season football game at the Big House....a Big Thrill. Watched the band marched into the stadium about an hour before the game. 109,651 in attendance. The stadium staff is great, and this huge crowd is handled nicely. The game was exciting. Michigan won. The food was good, the M Den was great for getting souvenirs from the game. The local police handled traffic very well after the game, so tens of thousands got out quickly, and on the road. Overall, a really nice memorable experience"
3464,Date of experience: September 2015,13-Sep-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Hail to the Big House!,"Thne greatest place to see a football game anywhere in America.  Get there early, and remember, no purses, umbrellas or chairbacks"

3466,Date of experience: September 2015,11-Sep-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Amazing Experience Every Time !!,"I go to 3 Michigan Wolverine games a year and this stadium is the BEST football venue in North America. There are no bad seats in the ""house"" The washrooms are decent and the food stands are always quick. Parking is never a problem, even with 100,000+ people at the games.BTW  best tailgating parties in all of sports."
3467,Date of experience: September 2015,10-Sep-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House my #1 or #2 Favorite place on earth,"Michigan Stadium is the most exciting place to see a sporting event period. It has 1) 110,000+ excited people 2) the Michigan Marching Band 3) the Michigan Wolverine football team. No other sports stadium experience can compare (& I started with going to Wrigley Field in Chicago which is number 2. If you can find a ticket (40 years of sell outs of more than 100,000 people must say something) it is an experience you shouldn't miss."
3468,Date of experience: September 2015,6-Sep-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Impressive Stadium,"We went for the Yoga movement event in September 5, 2015 and the stadium is very impressive. Unique experience."
3472,Date of experience: October 2014,23-Aug-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Autumn in America,"Join your voice with over 110,000 other in cheering U of M on. This is the college football team with more wins than any other in the country and the tradition runs deep. The stadium is magnificent and the team, (with a few glitches in the recent years) is as well. Welcome a legend, Jim Harbaugh, back as he leads the Wolverines back to glory. BEAT OSU!"
3473,Date of experience: November 2014,11-Aug-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Nothing else like it!,"We are season ticket holders for UM.  We love coming back for games and get back 2 to 3 times a season.  The stadium is like nothing else, UM is VERY PROUD of their stadium & it shows.  Security is very tight, but they are super friendly.  We have never had an issue with any of the staff there, they all are very friendly & helpful - it's very easy to get lost/turned around in there.  Do not bring in any bags - even a purse - its not allowed.  Lines are extremely long to get in but they seem to move smoothly & quickly.    Restrooms seem plentiful & are maintained pretty well throughout the game - kudos to the staff restocking TP!  Food is available at football prices.  Also, there is a M Den store on site so you can make sure to purchase your apparel.  If you want an experience in an amazing stadium make sure to get tickets - 2015 it may be hard - sold out crowds thanks to Jim Harbaugh being back home where he belongs!  GO BLUE!"
3475,Date of experience: November 2014,4-Aug-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Advice for Visiting the Big House,"The 2015 football season is nearly upon us.  Since  you are reading this review, you are probably not a regular visitor to the Stadium and want to get advice about attending a game.  So here goes.Reports are that all games are sellouts this year, for the first time in quite a while.  So it won't be easy to get a ticket and sit with friends unless your seat is next to theirs.  There are occasional empty seats so you might be able to get close to them.Be sure not to bring any bags into the Stadium.  You must check them at the door (at Crisler Arena).  You will be able to retrieve them after the game.  Do not even bring a seat cushion unless it is solid rubber!!  Seat cushions are not allowed if they can be unzipped.Parking is a challenge.  There are even fewer near-by parking lots this year than in the past.  Parking across the street at the Golf and Outing Club is available but very expensive ($40 or so per car).  You can also park at Pioneer High School (kitty corner from the Stadium).  On-street parking is occasionally available well before the game on streets to the west of the Stadium and east of State Street.  There are many front lawns and driveways around the Stadium where parking is solicited though not always cheap.  My wife and I typically don't deal with this -- we park at a hotel and take the bus to the Stadium.  Last year's cost was $2 per person each way, so a good deal together with free parking.  The only difficulty is the bus ride back since many games are close and people don't often leave early.  So, as soon as the game ends you must race to get in line in order to get an early departing bus.  For more bus info, go to http://www.theride.org/Services/EventServices/UMFootballGameShuttles.If your seat is on the east side of the Stadium and it is a noon or mid-afternoon game, you will regret not bringing a visor or hat and sunscreen.  Since you cannot bring food into the Stadium, you must plan to buy it there when you want to eat.  There is something available for almost everyone, though you might have to walk around the Stadium to find it.  Of course, food isn't cheap.To get the complete experience, you might want to catch the Band's pre-game percussion section performance.  This is terrific and occurs about two hours before the game at Revelli Hall, not far from the Stadium.  After this performance, the entire band forms and marches to the Stadium.  Quite inspiring!Have a good time!!  Prepare for excitement!!"
3476,Date of experience: October 2014,29-Jul-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Unbelievable Experience,"Our first trip to 'The Big House' was in 1997 (last time Wolverines won National Championship)  with our 2 sons who are both sports nuts. Before the game we walked by all the tailgaters having one heck of a time - people were barbecuing others were playing games in front of where they were set up, others had brought their TV's and had them set outside (with satellites) enjoying a cold brew - just a great atmosphere.  Then we arrived at the stadium, but it wasn't until you go inside the actual stadium to your seat that you realise just how humungous  this stadium is. I bet we all sat there for about half an hour in awe.  When the game was on the atmosphere was electric and everyone really got right into it.  The half time show was just incredible for both teams.  It was an unbelievable experience.  Since then, for the last six years our son and daughter-in-law take us to a game and now we do the tailgating starting around 8:30am and it is just a great day.  This year we are going to the opening game on September 12th, 2015 and we are really looking forward to it.  One of the first things I noticed was how clean everything was around and in the stadium and the women's washrooms which they have plenty of.  Treat yourself and go sometime.  GO BLUE!"
3480,Date of experience: October 2014,15-Jul-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Slippery Rock University at Michigan Stadium!,"We went to Michigan Stadium to watch Slippery Rock University play Mercyhurst in The Big House Battle.  Having graduated from Penn State, I thought I knew big stadiums, but whoa!  The Bowl is amazing.  And surprisingly pretty on the exterior.  The only thing that would have made it better is if SRU had won."
3482,Date of experience: August 2014,12-Jul-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,a must have experience if visiting Ann Arbor,if you want to truly feel what it means to be a wolverine you gotta watch a game at the Big House! (Please wear something blue and/or maize)
3485,Date of experience: September 2014,10-Jul-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House' lives up to its' name,"We had the opportunity to visit the Big House for a Wolverines game, and the experience made me a fan. It's a fantastic stadium with a super college energy.  The tailgating before the game was beyond fantastic.  The student and band sections kept me entertained well beyond the actual game.  When the opposing team kicked a field goal the crowd passed the ball all the way up and threw it out of the stadium; great team spirit.  It was an experience I intend to do again for sure."
3486,Date of experience: October 2014,8-Jul-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House,"This is a truly amazing stadium because it hold over 100,000 and admission into the stadium and out is so easy compared to smaller stadiums I have been in.  They also have enough female bathrooms to accommodate the ladies.  No long waits in line.  The history and architecture is fascinating.  Also when the game is over the Ann Arbor police to a great job of keeping traffic flowing so you don't have to wait long to leave.  Go Blue!"
3487,Date of experience: November 2014,7-Jul-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,I'm not a Wolverine,"Even though I'm not a Michigan Wolverine, I have to admit that this place is truly awesome. My daughter is in school here, so I've had opportunities to go to the ""Big House"" for several games. And while the team has been a little stinky the last few years, the stadium and fans positively rock! This place is immense. The only venue I've ever been to that is as large is a Nascar track. Lines are horrible. Food prices are unreasonable. And it sucks when it rains (or snows). But all that being said, you need to see this place to believe it."
3488,Date of experience: October 2014,6-Jul-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Cold day,"Went on Oct. 30............I don't like cold and this was my limit.  I have been before in September and the weather was nice.  Stadium is great, I don't think there are many bad seats.  Lots of entrances.  They have places to check bags for free b/c you cant take them into stadium.  No close parking unless you have a pass, but there were shuttles."
3489,Date of experience: September 2014,5-Jul-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Nothing beats the big house!!!,"We attend 3-4 games every year. We live in Houston Texas so we have a storage locker with all our tailgating stuff. Michigan has the biggest stadium, great tailgating, and terrific fans!"

It's a shame about the luxury boxes and other the other audacious upgrades.The night lights were a great addition, but I have not had the chance to attend a night game yet. It's a highly respected venue and city!"
3493,Date of experience: October 2014,17-Jun-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,over rated,like the parking not enough space from people in front and back can't see needs a bigger replay screen
3495,Date of experience: September 2014,10-Jun-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Best Place in the Country to Watch Football,"Every home game in Ann Arbor is the largest crowd to watch a football game in the world, and you can feel it. Michigan Stadium is electric on gameday. It also is a great experience with it being easy to get in and out of the stadium and lots of places nearby for tailgating, or it's an easy walk to downtown if you want a sit down place to have a bite to eat and grab a drink. Every football fan should see at least one game at Michigan Stadium - truly a bucket list experience."
3496,Date of experience: November 2014,3-Jun-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,You Need to See the Inside!,The biggest and best! Spending any amount of time on these hallowed grounds that hold many memories and many attendance records is a must do!
3497,Date of experience: October 2014,3-Jun-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Nothing like the Big house,"I'm not a football fan, but I had to see at least one game here.  I have to say, being around 110,000 other people is quite an experience.  It's amazing.  Everyone needs to go to one game at least once while you're in Ann Arbor just for the experience.  There is nothing like it."
3501,Date of experience: October 2014,2-May-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,great enviroment,the crowd makes the game. bench seating needs to go. great food and staff. need to bring back hungry howies.
3502,Date of experience: October 2014,16-Apr-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Amazing to be in the Big House,It is the best stadium I have ever been to.

3505,Date of experience: October 2014,3-Apr-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Big House,Can't wait for next year.  This year was first game UTL and can't wait for many more. In Harbaugh we trust.  I was thinking it would be a rat race with so many people but everything went smoothly.  Amazing how everyone exits the stadium as well.  Streets are packed
3507,Date of experience: September 2014,21-Mar-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Pretty amazing,"Very unique stadium, they don't call it The Big House for nothing. Engaged fans, but not too rowdy that it's uncomfortable. Even if you're not Michigan football fan, this is a pretty fun experience."
3508,Date of experience: September 2014,14-Mar-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Hard not to find Big Ten football electric,"Despite how the team is doing it's hard not to love football day in a Big Ten town with the huge excited crowds clad in team gear pouring into the stadium.  The Michigan stadium is so big you get caught up in the atmosphere even if you don't have a dog in that day's fight (I am not an alum of U of M).  There is something special about Big Ten football, often the more crisp air, the big bands, the tradition."
3509,Date of experience: September 2014,23-Feb-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Love game day at the Big House,"Even though it's been a tough stretch for Wolverines Football...(huge understatement) I still love going to game day at the Big House.  Tailgating at the golf course, cheering with 100,000 fans - it's a GREAT way to spend a fall Saturday afternoon.  I usually get tickets in the NE corner (section 43-44)... you get the best view and afternoon sunshine when the rest of the stadium is in the shadows.  Small tip, but it makes a big difference on a chilly day."
3510,Date of experience: November 2014,18-Feb-15,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Great venue,"Easy parking, great seating, good concessions (not cheap, but good) - A great sports arena out of the cold."

Nothing like singing the Victors and watching a great game...Went to the first night game against Notre Dame and all I can say is WOW!!!! If you get a chance to go a night game get there early in the morning enjoy the tailgating and make a day of it....

3515,Date of experience: September 2014,13-Dec-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,A fall afternoon at The Big House,"I have been coming to Michigan Stadium since the early 70s, and the experience never grows old. This magnificent stadium has gone through several improvements over the years, & each renovation only enhances the experience more! Nothing compares to spending a sunny Saturday afternoon in September watching college football!"

I have been to many events here, most recently the Utah game that was a major disappointment for the team, but the stadium itself is pure history.Sit a little higher so that you can see everything. Rows 20-40 are my favorite. Be prepared to be amazed at what a single bowl of 115,000 people looks like. It is truly an experience."
3517,Date of experience: November 2014,2-Dec-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,3,Underwhelmed,First visit to the stadium. A little surprised at the facility amenities. The video boards are nice but the sound system was poor in that sound was only coming from one side of the stadium. I did like that they have closed-captioning on the boards during the game.
3518,Date of experience: November 2014,23-Nov-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,2,Outhouse,"Yeah, Jerry Ford played here and it looks like it.  If you are looking for any of the amenities found in new sports complexes be prepared to be disappointed.  This is a 100,000 seat hole in the ground where the restrooms are undersized and a long walk away.  The Wi-Fi doesn't work and the seats are not built for 21st century Americans."

3521,Date of experience: November 2014,9-Nov-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Finally won a game at the Big House,"Michigan / Indiana was our second game this year.  I went to UofM so we've been to over 20 games.  I am upset that Michigan does not allow purses in the stadium this year.  What the what?  Seriously, are they worried about some woman sneaking in a Snickers bar to save some cash?  They have a purse/bag check, but what a pain.  Had to do this for our 1st game this year.  Didn't make the mistake the 2nd game.  All seats in the Big House are good.  With Michigan's so-so record, seats are cheaper and easy to get on Stub Hub.  Awesome!"

Seven years removed from her graduation, my wife brought me to Michigan during home coming weekend with 10 of her friends.  Part of the agenda was to visit this wonderful stadium.  Even though Big Blue is having a horrible season there is still a lot of school pride.  If you visit during the cold season try to get seats on the right side when facing the north end zone.  You will get the most sun there.My one qualm is that the seats are bench seating.  Meaning there are no backs to the seats."
3528,Date of experience: January 2014,2-Nov-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Great Atmosphere,"This place is legendary, definitely worth a visit if your a sports fan. Don't forget to tailgate when coming here too."

The night Game against Penn State is one to remember for the ages.  Put on your things to do list if you can get tickets.
3531,Date of experience: October 2014,15-Oct-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,The Big House,"Well having been to Beaver Stadium at Penn State I knew I wasn't going to be intimidated by the Big House, but I'm impressed. Large and 113k people packed in. Michigan fans are very nice and welcoming. As a ""visiting team"" fan....I wouldn't think twice about going back to Ann Arbor. Nice town!"
3532,Date of experience: October 2014,15-Oct-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Hail To The Big House!,"It's the biggest college football stadium in the country, and since the recent renovation, one of the nicest.  A great place to see (and experience) a college football game.  Michigan doesn't always win (especially this season), but they always put on a great show."
3533,Date of experience: October 2014,15-Oct-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,There is Nothing Like the Big House!,"My husband is a graduate of the University of Michigan, but I am not.   I'm from a small town in upstate NY, so needless to say the first time I stepped into Michigan Stadium over 20 years ago, I was completely overwhelmed.  This stadium fits more people than my hometown and surrounding towns combined.   If you've never been to The Big House, it is definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  Sitting in the largest stadium in the United States (3rd largest in the world) with 110,000+ of some of the most passionate college football fans in the world is just incredible.  And you'll see a wonderfully diverse crowd like no other at any sporting event - babies to senior citizens attend, and it is so great to see the look on people's faces when you know they are seeing The Big House for the very first time.  Even if you don't religiously cheer on the Wolverines, it's still an absolutely amazing experience.  I attend at least 2 to 3 games every season, so I've been here in every kind of weather and situation you can imagine.   A couple of suggestions if you decide to visit:- Arrive several hours (at least 3 hours) before the game and be prepared to walk at least a mile or more.   You can get parking close to the stadium, but it is expensive and it is very difficult to leave after the game with so many people exiting at one time.   We always park in a ramp on South Main Street (downtown Ann Arbor) or on East Williams Street.   - Absolutely no bags are allowed in the stadium. . . period.  I once tried to take in a very small wallet/bag and was not allowed entrance with it.  If you need your stuff like cell phone, aspirin, eye drops, tissues, etc., make sure you put it all in your pockets.- No umbrellas are allowed, so make sure you have a rain poncho with you. It's Michigan and the weather can change in the blink of an eye.  Also, unless it's going to be guaranteed 80 and sunny, wear layers of clothing.  Nothing worse than being in a huge stadium when the temperature suddenly drops and your car is a couple miles away.   I've made the mistake several times of leaving my car thinking the temperature was fine, only to have my ears aching by the time I reached the stadium because of the wind.  - If you can't handle large crowds, this is NOT the place for you.   There are tons and tons of people, and seating is very tight.   I think once I heard the number 18"" of space per seat, but not sure if that is accurate or not.  Sometimes I feel like I have only about 12"".   Trust me, it is very snug.  If you are in Ann Arbor, Michigan and can get some tickets to an event at The Big House, I guarantee you will not forget your experience!  Go Blue!!"
3535,Date of experience: October 2014,12-Oct-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,2,Tight seating,"Love to come to The Big House for the fun and excitement, but the seats (benches) are way to tight. If you get up you have to fight for your seat because every one has spread out. Stop trying to squeeze out every $, and  increase the space per person. Isn't 106,00 enough vs 113,000???"
3536,Date of experience: September 2014,2-Oct-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Gotta Love the Big House!,"Even if you aren't a fan of Michigan football, you have to see this place if you want to see an amazing facility that gives the best views and has an energy that makes football great.  I only hope the team gets back on track!"
3537,Date of experience: September 2014,30-Sep-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The REAL Big House,"The stadium is so big that when you are walking to find your seat, you almost forget about the game. Overwhelming experience, wish the game was as good."
3538,Date of experience: September 2014,30-Sep-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,First Rate Venue,"It's a big place, befitting the Big House moniker.  Parking is a real problem, and very expensive.  There's an obvious continuing effort to keep the facility updated and offer easily available food and rest room facilities.  In our view it is as good as you can get.  The only complaint is the metal bench seating - hard on the butt!"

3544,Date of experience: September 2014,23-Sep-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Best Stadium Atmosphere Anywhere,"Despite the recent run of terrible form for the Wolverines, the atmosphere at The Big House is not diminished. There is no better place to watch football anywhere! The views are excellent, the atmosphere is electric, and the city of Ann Arbor is awesome. One downside is the terrible traffic trying to get out of Ann Arbor following games, it may be the worst traffic I've ever experienced in my life. Also, the food and drink is extremely expensive ($4.50 for a bottle of water)."
3545,Date of experience: September 2014,22-Sep-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,You Don't Know Big Until the Big House,"This place is HUGE.  Just saw my third game here and what I always marvel at is how you cannot fathom how big this is until actually entering the stadium.Good crowd and traffic control.  Benches are predictably uncomfortable.  But the spirit here is amazing and contagious, even for those who are not alums nor big fans of college football.Best to park near central campus or downtown Ann Arbor and walk to the stadium.    Beware of zealous enforcement of parking meters in Ann Arbor.  Tickets are $20 if you get one.And be prepared for friendly, alcohol-fueled students whose 'tailgating' begins several hours before kickoff."
3547,Date of experience: September 2014,17-Sep-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,BIG thrill at the BIG HOUSE,"I did not graduate from U. of Michigan but my husband did. I have learned to embrace and cherish every game we attend. Though we are older (in our seventies now) it is a joy and fun and worth the effort.This year we went to see to the Wolverines play my school, Miami U (Ohio). Of course, we were killed but we gave them a scare.The fans are polite no matter what team you're for. And the band, and the television screens, the fly overs, etc. All Good and major fun."
3549,Date of experience: September 2014,16-Sep-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,What a Place,"Huge!  Efficient entry and exit.  What a show.  Half-time band performance was excellent.  We happened to be there for the 200th Anniversary of the Star Spangled Banner, so there was an air show at Half-Time.  What fun.  Students are a hoot, alum are a hoot, too.Oh yeah, there was a game, too.  UM 34 - Miami (OH) 10"
3550,Date of experience: September 2014,15-Sep-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Great atmosphere to take in a game,"I recently visited the renovated Michigan Stadium and came away impressed.  Great sight-lines and a good overall family experience as fans were respectful and staff was efficient in accepting tickets, offering directions, etc."
3551,Date of experience: September 2014,15-Sep-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Very Big House,"It is big and has been getting bigger. I think they had a crowd of 115,000 for a game a couple of times. They have had over 200 football games in a row with over 100,000 fans. It is a good place to see a football game. Even the seats up high have a good view and with the 2 big screens you can get a close up view. You can't bring much into the stadium and the tickets are expensive.Michigan won so I was happy."
3554,Date of experience: August 2014,4-Sep-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,What an Experience!,"Here are the differences between attending a game today and when I was an undergrad many years ago:  you can't bring anything, not even a clutch purse, into the stadium; tickets are way more expensive but the seats are smaller (they painted the seat numbers closer together); there are skyboxes for the corporate folks now; they hand out yellow pompoms to the cheering crowds, my rear end is bigger, so having a seat cushion really helped!  Here's what's the same as when I was an undergrad:  lots of energetic singing and cheering; instant friendships with those seated near you (even if you've never laid eyes on each other); the famous Michigan marching band show at half-time, tons of Wolverine spirit.   If you're lucky enough to get tickets, plan a tail-gate after the game as well as before like our savvy local friends did--it gives the crowds and the traffic a chance to thin out."

3556,Date of experience: August 2014,3-Sep-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Nothing like it!,"Most years, my husband and I and our best friends (from undergrad days at Michigan) go to the opening game. And, of course, during our four years of school, we never missed a game.However, each trip to the Big House is uniquely great, decade after decade, year after year. The Wolverine spirit is loud, fun and the epitome of what a college football game should be. Since the stadium now holds 106,000 with the latest extension up, many people in Dallas tell me that visiting it is on their ""Bucket List."" In general, Ann Arbor is just what you envision as a college town - as the U."
3557,Date of experience: November 2013,3-Sep-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Go Blue!,"Tailgating at The Big House can be a blast! If you are lucky enough to have tickets to a game, awesome! The atmosphere is electric! Like most sports venues, seating is VERY tight and you might like to bring a small seat cushion to save your spot."
3558,Date of experience: October 2013,2-Sep-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Unbelievable,No place better to watch a college football game even better with it's addition.  Too bad it was under renovation year our son graduated as his class is the only class ever not to graduated in the big house.
3559,Date of experience: August 2014,2-Sep-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Great Football Venue,Ann Arbor handles traffic/parking with incredible efficiency.  In and out of stadium and back to Detroit Airport in no time.  Don't know how they do it!
3560,Date of experience: August 2014,1-Sep-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House,"Everyone needs a place to call home. Why not the Big House? Win or lose, this stadium experience is amazing and rarely ever the same twice. Belongs on Everyone's bucket list. Be sure to sit between rows 40 & 60 for the very best viewing and experience."
3561,Date of experience: August 2014,31-Aug-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Its more than a game. Its a production,"Wow. College games have changed. I have not seen one at the big house for a long time. Its quite a production from the big screens, the on field entertainment, the pre and post game shows and I'm not even considering the footbal game.The good: A thrilling experience among 100,000 plus fans. A great view from almost anywhere. Easy to find sections and seats. Lots of staff keeping the herds moving and pointing you along. Little tolerance for drunk and disorderly behavior. Lots of law enforcement presence along with EMS. They take this seriously.Great big screens for replays. Some vendors but not so many that they block the action. The bad: Parking is an adventure. You can get surprisingly close up to an hour before kickoff for $20 and up. Plan on walking a long way if you dont plan ahead. Concessions are Disney-like. $4.50 for a bottle of water? $5.00 for a coke? Bring lots of cash. A decent selection of stadium quality food can be had, but be ready for the payout. Seat prices. Enough said. $75 for an upper section near the end zone. It goes up from there. Dont pay full price. Season ticket holders get charged a seat license. Seats? What seat? You get about half a cheek worth. It always fun to be sitting hip to hip with shoulders turned and you see a large family lumber up and want to squeeze into their seats in an apparently full row. Despite all of this, it is still worth taking in a game at the big house once in a while.Tips: I would recommend avoiding the warmer month games. Sharing sweat is not enjoyable and you bake in the noon kickoff games. This is not a place for people with fear of crowds or personal space issues. Arrive two hours before kick off to avoid some of the madness. Park strategically near the gate near your seats. You wont be sorry. Dont try to bring in stuff they prohibit. It just slows everything down. Relax and dont be rushed. Arriving late, drunk, broke, and annoying will turn what could be a good experience into a bad one."
3562,Date of experience: August 2014,30-Aug-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Great college footbal experience,"I went to college at University of Michigan many years ago and have been to many games over the years. I don't like to go when it is cold any more and have gone to very few games in the last 15 years. I got some good tickets from friends and went with some of my old college friends. The team has been very disappointing recently and we were very happy with the  results today against Appalachian State. Also there were some predictions of rain which never occurred. The crowd was about 106,000 and is well behaved."
3563,Date of experience: September 2013,23-Aug-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Greatest Venue in Sports!,"Yes, I'm a Wolverine, so if you want an unbiased review, keep looking.  I graduated many years ago when The Big House was still the Big House, but it wasn't as big as it is now.  Back in the day, we also didn't have Jumbotrons and laser light shows.  I can't say the addition of these has added to the experience of game day at Michigan Stadium, as I'm old school and like to be there just for the game, but they don't detract as much as you might think either.Michigan Stadium is called The Big House because it is literally the largest venue in sports.  My son and I were there in 2013 when Notre Dame came to call, and we packed more than 115,000 people into Michigan Stadium.  There's no feeling like it anywhere in the world, and every sports fan should experience Michigan Stadium at least once in his/her lifetime.  Seeing a football game live in this venue is like nothing else you'll ever experience.  That said, here are the drawbacks:  Not enough bathrooms for women.  This seems to be an issue everywhere you go, but it's really annoying to miss long stretches of the game in order to pee.  People drink at football games.  Yeah, and I don't mean Cokes either.  You can run into some pretty rowdy drunks at Michigan Stadium, which surprised the heck out of me, because it's a dry stadium, and I naively believed that rule was enforced.  Go figure.Cell service is sketchy at best.  An old friend was at the game, and he texted me numerous times to meet him at halftime.  Sadly, I didn't get those texts until the next morning, when they all appeared in a text avalanche.  If you're planning to use your phone for anything more than pictures, think again.The Big House is one of the only stadiums built into the ground.  That said, it's truly an engineering marvel.  (You'll find lots of those in Ann Arbor!)  However, once you get down the stairs to your seat, you'll eventually have to get back up, and this can be tricky.  The stairs go straight up, and there are no hand rails.  If you're bringing an older family member or friend, try to sit near the top of the bowl to save them from a struggle after the game.Parking is at a premium.  I took my 70+ year old mother a few years ago, and we parked close so she wouldn't have to walk too far after climbing those horrendous stairs.  (We had field level seats, so I knew she'd be climbing.)  I paid $50 to park within a block of the stadium.  You won't find parking for less than $20 within a 2 mile radius.  Just accept it and plan for it, and you'll be okay.Get there early, and buy lots of Michigan paraphernalia, because that's what you do on game day.  Be respectful and decent to the opposing fans, because that's what we do in the Big Ten.  Be pleasant to the officers at the gate who are there to check for contraband, because they're doing their best to keep everyone safe.  It's a huge stadium, and if everyone acts with grace and courtesy, it'll be one of the most memorable experiences of your life.  Enjoy the game, and cheer for your team, and remember the immortal words of the great Bo Schembechler, ""The Team! The Team!  The Team!"" Go Blue!"

3568,Date of experience: August 2014,5-Aug-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,lots of people....,"I'm an Iowa grad, so it's natural for me to dislike everything having to do with the U of Michigan. Their stadium was very nice, but you have to go in realizing that 100,000+ people are going to make for long lines everywhere. I bought the Outdoor Club seats and it was well worth it- indoor A/C available with short lines for restrooms and far better concessions than what was available below in the bleacher seat sections."
3569,Date of experience: October 2013,5-Aug-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,3,Overrated,"Attending an event at the University of Michigan stadium is a bit overrated.  The cost of tickets is outrageous, the cost of food and beverages is high and parking is a challenge."

3573,Date of experience: August 2014,3-Aug-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,2,Handicap seating is a joke,"Bought $120 tickets for Man U / Real Madrid. Seats were row 56 directly behind the handicap seating.  Couldn't see a thing through the backs of the heads of the 3 disabled patrons, and their 12 companions.  Ended up standing throughout the entire game.Poor planning and even worse policies.  I can understand 1 person to accompany a wheelchair, but 3 or 4 borders on idiocy, especially when the view of every person behind them is obstructed."

Anyone who hasn't had the chance to see a football game at Michigan Stadium has to do it.  It's a great atmosphere and the people are very friendly.  Some of the best places to tailgate are Ann Arbor Golf & Outing (expensive to park though at $40-50) or the train tracks behind the Stadium Deli parking lot ($20) on S. Industrial.  The tailgating experience is incredible.  For college football enthusiasts who plan trips with their buddies to see games at all the high profile Division 1A schools, I highly recommend going to the ""Big House.""  You won't regret it."

It is a once in a lifetime stop of any visitor.  The largest collegiate owned stadium in the country (possibly the world).  The hosted the Winter Classic here and what a treat.  It was cold for sure but they did it up well."
3586,Date of experience: October 2013,9-Apr-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Biggest stadium around,Great venue to watch college football. I may be a MSU fan but this place is something else. Always love going to watch the state rivals
3587,Date of experience: November 2013,9-Mar-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Big House!,Really good environment on game days.Over 200 games with more than 100.000 people on the stadium in a consecutive string! One of the things to do if you are on a game weekend.
3590,Date of experience: October 2013,4-Mar-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Best Place in America to watch college football!,The atmosphere in and around the stadium on game day cannot be beat.  Very clean and safe and loads of fun.  Have been going to games here for years.
3592,Date of experience: January 2014,4-Feb-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Winter Classic,"It was freezing cold but at least the Toronto Maple Leafs won!  There really could have been more parking or transportation available, but it was New Year's Day."
3593,Date of experience: January 2014,31-Jan-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Huge stadium,"Stadium is huge, so you will face some delays and rush. So arrive early. You can find some local sites from Google who offers parking spaces but you can find lot of private houses renting their front yards nearby the stadium."
3594,Date of experience: November 2013,15-Jan-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,What can you say? It IS the Big House,"Michigan Stadium is the largest stadium in the country to watch College Football. There is no bad seat, concessions are reasonable and souvenirs plentiful. Seating is tight for the really big guys but there is rarely a problem. 115,000 of your closest friends are watching the sporting event with you."
3595,Date of experience: January 2014,15-Jan-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,WOW,"What an amazing stadium!  We attended the 2014 NHL Winter Classic at The Big House, and we loved every moment of it!  What an awesome building.  It is very well layed out.  Seating sections were well marked and seats were easy to find.  The bathrooms near our section were not large enough to accommodate the size of the crowd, but that was my only issue.  Now we have to come back in the summer to watch a football game!"
3596,Date of experience: January 2014,13-Jan-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,3,Surprisingly intimate for 100K+ people,"Came here for the Winter Classic 2014, and this was definitely an excellent experience. A lot probably had to do with the atmosphere of the game and the fans, but the stadium is set up in a way that even in the 80th row back we felt like we were part of the action. Even from the last row, you could see what was happening on the ice without relying on the monitors too much,and this was with blowing snow everywhere.My first complaint with the venue was that they did not have it set up for tail-gating for this event. I'd love to come back for a football game and see what a home game is like for Michigan, but we expected there to be a better atmosphere outside of the stadium before the game. This might also be because of the weather, but we found there was more of a party at our RV parking lot than at the Big House.The restroom situation was unbelievably bad. I ended up waiting almost 20 minutes to use the restroom one time! I noticed a lot of guys weren't even using the restrooms, they were just peeing in janitor closets or even in the stairwell, which is disgusting and incredibly unsanitary. They need to do some major renovations and increase the restroom capacity by about 3 times. The lines for concessions were also so long that we didn't bother buying anything.Overall it was a great experience, but it was mostly due to the atmosphere and fans."
3597,Date of experience: November 2013,9-Jan-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Greatest Stadium,"Michigan Stadium is hands down the greatest sporting venue on the planet. Nothing compares to watching a game here on a fall Saturday. While seating may be a little tight for those who are bigger, the overall atmosphere more than makes up for it. If you're a football fan, or sports fan in general, this is a must see experience."
3598,Date of experience: January 2014,9-Jan-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Great venue for Winter Classic,The stadium itself was amazing. The only drawback was the trouble getting to a concession stand between periods. We never did reach a stand but due to the congestion in the concourse missed part of the next period just trying to get back to our seats.
3599,Date of experience: January 2014,7-Jan-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Winter Classic,Toronto vs. Detroit for the 2014 NHL Winter Classic.  Great venue.  BIG!  Lot's of fun for watching an outdoor hockey game.  Would be great for a college football game in warmer weather.
3600,Date of experience: January 2014,6-Jan-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,One massive experience! A classic for sure!!,"I really enjoyed my time at the Big House!  It was impressive the size and the stature of the stadium, after all Michigan Stadium is the largest stadium in the US and third largest in the world.  I was impressed by the fact that even in the bad seats, you still feel close to the action, more intimacy than I expected.  You obviously notice the proud and rich tradition of the Michigan Football program, which does add to the grandeur of the Stadium.  I attended the 2014 Winter Classic and was delighted by the Maple Leafs winning in a shootout.  The picturesque setting of the snow and the cold really added the awesome feel of the event for the 105,491 spectators!  My biggest qualms about the Big House were the poor state of the washrooms and the smallish souvenir stands that led to lengthy waits in both circumstances.  It should not take forty minutes to take a leak or line up go get a souvenir, even at an intermission.  That really takes away from the experience!  The overpriced souvenirs were expected because of the greedy NHL making a killing off of Fans, especially Leafs Nation.  That I won't hold against Michigan Stadium, but I hope the outrageous prices for souvenirs and parking($60!!) are not a consistent factor at football games.  I figure the one off event of the Winter Classic added to this gouging!  Nonetheless, the Big House was the perfect setting for this awesome experience.  The Classic could not have been so awesome if it was not for Michigan Stadium.  That makes a football game here necessary just to properly assess the attraction.  Thanks to the Big House!!"
3601,Date of experience: January 2014,6-Jan-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,2,Unprepared for the Winter Classic crowd,Getting to the stadium from Birmingham was a nightmare. Three days in Michigan in a snow storm and we saw one plow. The traffic was not managed by any police or security and many cars were going through red lights and sitting in intersections. A 45 minute trip took over 2 1/2 hours.We had no problem finding parking near the stadium and thought 40.00 was reasonable to park a few blocks away.Love the huge stadium and the game was fantastic but really- is it legal to serve alcohol and have hardly any bathrooms? There should have been rows of portable toilets brought in. People were urinating in the open as the only option to not wetting their pants.We defiantly were not having anything to eat or drink there- the line ups were ridiculous.
3602,Date of experience: January 2014,5-Jan-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Winter Classic 2014,"This game was on my bucket list, and I was NOT disappointed!  The stadium is huge, and impressive, and was the perfect venue for this game.  Add a little cold, and snow, and a Leafs win, and it couldn't have been better!"
3603,Date of experience: January 2014,5-Jan-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,3,Winter Classic,"Huge stadium, and we were there for the Winter Classic, an amazing experience.  My complaints about the stadium:  bathrooms are limited in number, and not very clean or updated.  Line ups were LONG.  Service for beer, concessions, etc. was very slow.  I understand there were huge crowds, but had the lines been quicker, I'm sure the profits for them would be better!  I opted not to get a $10 hot chocolate because I wasn't interested in waiting in any more line-ups, and at least 5 of the guys I was with, had fewer beers than they normally would at any other event."
3604,Date of experience: January 2014,5-Jan-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,2,Horrible management of patron movement.,The setup on the fiel for the Winter Classic was great but it took a half hour to get out and back to a washroom or concession.  Some people who arrived at the stadium just before game time couls not get to their seats until the third period (about 2 hours).  How do they handle the football games?  I would like an explanation from the NHL on why they had not anticipated this sort of problem.
3605,Date of experience: January 2014,4-Jan-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,NHL Winter Classic 2014,"Amazing! Great stadium, there is not a bad seat in the big house! Would definitely attend more games here!"
3606,Date of experience: January 2014,4-Jan-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Winter Classic!,The stadium was amazing!  Best if you don't go to the bathroom during the game though.  The waits were pretty bad.
3607,Date of experience: January 2014,4-Jan-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,2014 Winter Classic,"Was here when history was made 105,416 in attendance . This place is huge . excellent outing had by all . if only the weather was warmer."
3608,Date of experience: January 2014,3-Jan-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Winter Classic Wings v Maple Leafs,"For it being 13 degrees and snowing all day, the stadium accommodated 105,491 very well behaved Canadian and U.S.hockey fans quite well."
3609,Date of experience: January 2014,2-Jan-14,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Winter Classic Game,"We, along with 105,000 + others, went to the Winter Classic hockey game between the Leafs and Red Wings on New Years day.  The stadium was bigger than I expected though I know it is called ??The Big House??.  The setup they did was unreal and worth every penny to attend.  Only downfalls to me were the stairs. They were so slick due to the amount of snow falling I almost took a header twice trying to get to the bathroom.  Not much they could do about that I suppose with the amount of snow coming down, but an usher with a box of salt could have been really helpful.  Or railings that go all the way up the aisle to aid you in less than appealing weather conditions. Second would the whereabouts of the ATM machines.  We asked a concession clerk where we could find one, obviously looking to spend the money there, and was given a direction of  ??over there?? pointing to the next section.  We headed that way and did not find one.  We finally found one by accident outside the concession area when we went to purchase a 50/50 ticket. The stadium looks like a great place to watch a ball game and will hopefully bringing my brother back to watch one with me in the near future."
3610,Date of experience: November 2013,28-Dec-13,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,It is THE BIG HOUSE for a reason.,"Have been attending games here since 1967 - and entering the ring into the bowl still takes my breath away. And when  you hear "" Good afternoon, and welcome to Michigan Stadium for this the......"", and. ""Band -- take the field"". Goosebumps and tears. The flyovers have become more frequent and are great, as are the night games, the fireworks, and even the ""big  chill"" hockey gametes. Go Blue."
3611,Date of experience: November 2013,23-Dec-13,Big Ten,Michigan ,1,Tow pirates,"Be advised that they will tow your car from the Michigan Golf Course, which is next to The Big House, during football Saturday's 2 hours after the game! I went with my wife and another couple to the Nebraska game this year.  Wasn't told that the car had to be gone 2 hours after the game.  Came back 2 and 40 minutes later, bang! The car was gone, along with 7 others.  HMM, boy was that fast work! I was told that there is a sign on the gate when you ener the course. On the way out after picking up my car I saw it; but only after I had to stop and read. The way the trafic control was being done, there was no way anyone was seeing that sign.  My question is ...Right afer they tell you it's 20 bucks to park, why don't they mention...""Oh, by the way the car has to be gone 2 hours after the game.  Why not? I guess that makes too much sense and maybe the Chief of Police doesn't get that hole sponsorship from the tow company that he gets for his annual golf outing.So $180 later; which no one had the balls to mention, only the Tow Pirates when we picked up the car. Oh and by the way...Cash Only! What a joke.  We all said we aren't going back there any time soon.  Too impersonal, I'll stick with Camp Randall, Madison Wisconsin."
3612,Date of experience: November 2013,21-Dec-13,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Best Experience !,I have been going to Michigan games since I was a kid since my parents are alumni. There is nothing better than a sunny Saturday watching a game in a packed Michigan stadium. Go to Michigan games and seeing the Red Wings are my two favorite things to watch. I was fortunate once to do both in the same day. There is nothing like college football atmosphere. Sadly the quality of the team and the prices have kept me from going much the last few years. I did go to the opener this year and it reminded me how much I loved it.
3613,Date of experience: September 2013,12-Dec-13,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,The Big House,"Michigan football a must-do experience!  Plan on arriving early - for parking and to have fun checking out all the tailgating.  We live near the stadium and make a habit of going to at least one game a season.  For the other games, we walk through the tailgate grounds and enjoy the atmosphere!"
3614,Date of experience: November 2013,11-Dec-13,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,A well managed stadium.,"Stadium was clean, easy to get in and out of during a very popular U of M game. Plenty of bathrooms which were also clean."
3615,Date of experience: November 2013,10-Dec-13,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,Great Football Venue for Beating the Wolverines!,"Have not been here since the newer renovations.  Stadium looks a lot better and appears significantly more new and fresh.  When I was last here in 2003, I thought it looked worn and cheap.  I can't imagine there is a bad seat in the house.  As a Buckeye fan wearing scarlet, I only caught flack in the student section (expected, right?!), but everyone else was gracious and friendly.  As a college football fan, this is an incredible venue to watch a college game.  scUM fans should be proud of this amazing stadium."
3616,Date of experience: December 2013,3-Dec-13,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,WOW what an experience,Was at the Ohio State Michigan game as a OSU fan I was treated very well by fans and stadium staff.  The food was good and the stadium was extremely clean.
3617,Date of experience: November 2013,1-Dec-13,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,"Michigan Stadium aka ""The Big House"" - Nov. 30, 2013 - Ohio State 42  Michigan 41","It was a beautiful sunny day at The Big House in Ann Arbor. And it was even a better day of competitive football between the most heralded arch-rivalry in college football. Ann Arbor is a user-friendly community, even for Ohio State fans (for the most part). I highly recommend that Ohio State fans make the trek to Ann Arbor at every opportunity to see the Buckeyes and Wolverines fight it out. It is a dreamy, bucket-list item for any Ohio State fan. Ohio State's 42/41 win over Michigan yesterday (Nov. 30, 2013) was its 24th consecutive win (thus, undefeated for 2 complete seasons) and puts Ohio State in contention for the national championship. Ann Arbor offers lots of decent hotels to stay and restaurants and pubs to dine. Don't miss this iconic football experience. Go Bucks!!"
3618,Date of experience: November 2013,30-Nov-13,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Great Place To See A Game,"Michigan Stadium is steeped in history, and is nicer and louder since the renovations were completed in 2010. The game day experience in Ann Arbor is not to be missed, and the enormity of the crowd is truly impressive. On the downside, the stadium lacks virtually all amenities: Almost all of the seating is bleachers, the aisles are small and the concessions are very ordinary. But those are small criticisms: this is all about the Michigan Football experience."
3619,Date of experience: November 2013,26-Nov-13,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,An experience that cannot be matched,It is amazing to be a part of the largest crowds ever to watch a football game.  The crowds are impressive and the ambience is special.  The fast and easy exits of the crowds make it a pleasure to attend events.
3620,Date of experience: September 2013,17-Nov-13,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,"Must see, Must Experience","Go.  You will remember it and talk about it forever.  Unbelievable just to be there and see the vast expanse of people.   If you're in Ann Arbor on a Saturday afternoon; it's a must see.  You can always buy seats out on the street.  Don't worry, not a bad seat in the house.   Close or far, you can see everything.   Go early if you can; walking around the tailgating spots is fun.   Many great places to eat downtown or on campus.  Many choices for food inside the stadium too.   Fans are very friendly and respectful of the opposition fans.  No worries.  Parking is easy, but I recommend you park near campus.  It's a comfortable walk and easier to get out after the game."
3621,Date of experience: October 2013,10-Nov-13,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Awesome!,"It's the Big House! This is a must see for anyone who is interested in football. The bleacher type seating is close, but great for cheering on the Wolverines!"
3622,Date of experience: December 2012,10-Nov-13,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Rivalry Bucket List Trip For College Football Fanatic,My buddies and I have been traveling at least once a year to what we think are the biggest college rivalries in the country.  This one happened to be Ohio State - Michigan in Ann Arbor.Overall the stadium was phenomenal and louder then we anticipated.  Locals stated that the boxes on each side really helped it out.  It was impressive and although not really a big ten fan we had great time and got to see 5 year skid for Michigan end.
3623,Date of experience: December 2012,4-Nov-13,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,It's the Big House!,"I grew up in Ann Arbor and attended that High School that looks like a factory just to the South West of the Stadium. Having said that, there is nothing that can match the energy of a Michigan game at Home. Yes traffic is screwed up, but one deals with it. For visitors (as I am now) parking is pretty easy, $15 you walk a mile, $30 you walk 1/4 mile - your choice, either way you can get no blocking easy out (ask before). Do not try to walk into any of the popular restaurants on game day/night without reservations. Likewise don't expect to get a State Rd or similar Hotel on game weekend without a lot of lead time.  Fortunately there are options in Ypsilanti or Novi not that far to travel. Campus area is nice to walk through, the Quandangle makes you feel like you are in the middle of an East Coast Ivy League School."
3624,Date of experience: October 2013,31-Oct-13,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,what an afternoon,"63-47 win over Indiana. 4 plus hours in the rain but it was all worth it. My first time in the Big House, What and experience."
3625,Date of experience: October 2013,20-Oct-13,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,great experience,"We went to the Michigan/IU game on 10-19-13 and had a great time! This was our first visit to the ""Big House"" and I was in awe of how many the place can seat.  It was a sea of yellow and the 1/2 time show (Facts of Life) was awesome!  Purses or bags of any kind are not allowed so be sure to have what you need before you go in.  We did not have to worry about parking but there was plenty of options in all price ranges.  It's a must see for football fans."
3626,Date of experience: October 2013,15-Oct-13,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,The Big House,"We visited the University of Michigan for the Michigan vs Minnesota football game. We have no ties to the university but wanted to see a game at the largest stadium in the U.S. We arrived in Ann Arbor 6 hours before our game started to avoid the traffic & parking dilemmas. We parked at the Republic Parking garage on Maynard Street for 12 hours & paid approx. $14. The garage is in close walking distance to Main Street & Kerrytown. Both have great shops & restaurants. The stadium was about a 20 min.walk. It was so exciting walking with the big crowds & all the people cheering & celebrating. This is definitely a college town & they take their football seriously.The day of our game there were approx.111,000 attending. The crowd of fans were amazing but it wasn't as loud as I had envisioned. No ear plugs necessary. Our only gripe was the entrance to get into the stadium. The line was very long & people were cutting in. Once into the stadium getting to your seat was quite easy. They do not allow bags of any kind(including camera/binocular cases), food, or umbrella's. The students usually wear yellow so we wore navy. Plenty of stores on & around the university for Michigan gear. If your in need of a ticket there are plenty of scalpers on Main St. After the game we had dinner on Main Street to avoid the thousands of people leaving the area."
3627,Date of experience: October 2013,14-Oct-13,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Its Reputation Precedes It,"No need to describe the excitement of the Big House so I'll just post some reminders for new visitors....don't bring a purse or backpack of any kind. If you do you will be directed to a place to check it. Cameras are OK, but no umbrellas! Seat cushions are also OK. Surrounding the stadium when you go in is a large pavillion, so don't be afraid to go get something to eat at halftime - plenty of room and lines are not too bad. There is nothing like a game at the Big House!"

Everyone was friendly to them, and they were obviously happy that they werent getting ribbed too bad.  A good time was had by all."
3630,Date of experience: November 2012,9-Oct-13,Big Ten,Michigan ,4,A historic stadium and an historic loss,"I finally went to see a game at THE BIG HOUSE.   It was a beautiful day and although we were up towards the back of the stadium we had a good view of the field.  Its a great place but it is your standard huge college football stadium with little in the way of creature comforts.  It is very cool how it does not look big from the outside until you realize they dug way down.  The atmosphere was very good although it really fell off after the final whistle.  It is not everyday that the #5 team in the country gets beat by Appalachin State.  We didn't care who won so it was nice to see the huge upset although it effected the funin Ann Arbor that night as most people didnt' go out.  Check it off the bucket list.(I had to choose Nov '12 as the date, it didn't allow the actual date several years ago)"
3631,Date of experience: October 2013,7-Oct-13,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,"""It's Michigan, for God's Sake!!""","Nothing like football in the Big House.

3637,Date of experience: September 2013,8-Sep-13,Big Ten,Michigan ,5,Fantastic Atmosphere,Michigan stadium is a great place to watch NCAA football. The wolverines are a historic team and play in the largest stadium in America. The seats closest to the students have more electricity as the students have so much energy.

What a magnificent way to jumpstart the college athletic season.  We shopped online for tickets, were treated with great courtesy with our disability permits and enjoyed a spectacular ""Michigan"" Saturday.  This is the first time that we had visited ""The Big House"" since the recent major renovations.  Our hats our off to the Michigan Athletic Department for producing a sensational facility.  What a tremendous difference to the access, restrooms and concessions.  The Michigan Family should be very proud. This August 31st event contained the usual pomp, colors, bands and tradition that an Ann Arbor fall Saturday usually produces.  When you combine this with the techy James Bond half time show, complete with helicopters and rocketman, we were treated to a first class event.  These frills were only upstaged by the terrific display of athleticism and sportsmanship staged by two historic college institutions.  We had such a tremendous visit that we will return often and soon."

It does kill the whole day, but the live game experience can be very special if you can deal with the hassles of parking, the packed in seating, etc."
3664,Date of experience: January 2022,16-Dec-22,Big Ten,Michigan State,3,Visitors Tailgating Difficult to Find,"The parking lots at this campus are spread far and wide and finding tailgating of opposing fans can be tough.  We had to ask the parking lot attendees if our fans were there, and finally found some tucked in a corner.  They could make it a better experience for visiting fans to designate an area for them, and our fans generally travel so this says a lot when we can't find them amongst the green.   The Spartan fans were friendly, and we did have a good time overall.  There was a definite shortage of port-a-potties too, and men resorted to peeing in the bushes to let the ladies stand in shorter lines."
3665,Date of experience: September 2022,26-Sep-22,Big Ten,Michigan State,4,Great day in Lansing,Amazing day in East Lansing! The atmosphere around the stadium was great-tons of tailgating and very friendly people. The only negative was the limited bathroom facilities in the stadium. We were on the upper deck and there were no womens bathrooms unless you went down two levels. Then you waited in line down the concourse to get into an old and small bathroom.  They need to update
3666,Date of experience: January 2020,14-Dec-20,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Best stadium in the Big Ten (and maybe beyond),"Spartan Stadium is AWESOME!!!!.  It is very impressive from the outside as you approach, especially from the south where there are championship flags to get you connected with the rich history and tradition of MSU football, and the giant murals on the outside.  The new video monitors are spectacular!!!  There is one large board at the south end, and two smaller (but still plenty large) at the north end.  And a bank of connected monitors frame the north side of the stadium, providing cool visual designs and accents.  Never seen anything like it in a football stadium.  Really brings the place to life.Great sight lines too.  And LOUD!!!  You can feel the vibe when the Spartans are rolling.  Plenty of concessions and bathrooms (gimme a Melting Moments chip-wich please).  The only complaint is getting down from the upper tier.  There is only one exit; a graded ramp at the south end.  Seems like the damn thing goes on forever.  But a small price to pay for such an awesome facility.GO GREEN!!!"
3667,Date of experience: October 2019,21-Mar-20,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Always energizing!,"Going here to cheer on the Spartans is always a thrill. Bathroom waits are better than they once were, concessions abundant.Only complaint is the confusing directions to get to certain areas. No matter, worth the trouble!"
3668,Date of experience: October 2019,11-Feb-20,Big Ten,Michigan State,3,Great place to catch a college football game.,"Go here and watch my Wolverines win.  No better place to cheer for the maize and blue.  Seriously though, it is a fun atmosphere and visitors generally are treated respectfully."
3669,Date of experience: September 2019,30-Sep-19,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Park in The City and Walk Over,"We saw a great game on a classic fall day.  MSU won - but we would have known that at home.  The stadium is a great place to watch a game.  The jumbotrons mean you don??t miss key bits of action.  If you are unsure, go to StubHub and pick up inexpensive tickets.  Give it a try.  It is a great way to see a game and learn the delight of sitting in the crowd.  We had a ball."
3670,Date of experience: August 2019,19-Aug-19,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Beautiful Statium,"Spent a hour at Spartan Stadium for ""Meet the Spartans"" and the start of the football season. Tables were set up with the players autographing free posters. The snack bars were open and Spartan gear was available for sale. You could also go in the seating area and view the inside and field. Had a wonderful time in this beautiful stadium."
3671,Date of experience: November 2018,11-Nov-18,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,"""Enjoyed watching Big Ten Football""","Easy to get in and out of our parking area, which was near the stadium. The stadium workers were very helpful when arriving and directing us up to our seats. Great place to watch a game and neat gameday experiences. One of our favorite Big Ten Stadiums to visit."
3672,Date of experience: November 2018,10-Nov-18,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Great Place to Watch a Game!,"We found easy parking to tailgate a mile from stadium ($30). The Spartan fans were respectful and fun to talk too. Getting into stadium at Gate A was kind of ridiculous with a full body pat down of every fan (no metal detectors so I am guessing this is about alcohol and not safety).  We seemingly walked another mile up a winding ramp to get up to section 110 (row 9).  Once we got there we were directed to our seats by an usher.  Stadium seemed really intimate for 75,000 seats.  Not too many bad seats in the place.  The three jumbotrons are very nice!  Buckeyes won by 20 to complete a great day on stop number 6 of our Big Ten Stadium quest."
3673,Date of experience: October 2018,27-Oct-18,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Lots of Changes since my last visit in 1966!,"As an alum of both MSU and U of Michigan, there is nothing better than watching these two rivals play. Haven't been in Spartan Stadium since my junior year, and the changes were amazing.  Seats were great, and access was easy, except that we had to evacuate for lightning which added more than an hour to the 2018 game.  State fans were friendly even though we were cheering for U-M.  We experienced all 4 season in those hours, including blue skies, lightning, rain, hail and snow. Come dressed for it.  A warning - no bags, including ladies' purses, backpacks or umbrellas are allowed in the stadium.  PS -- Sparty is still holding on to his helmet!"
3674,Date of experience: October 2018,15-Oct-18,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,go Green,"Love, love, love the Spartan Stadium at Michigan State University.  The first time i walked into the stadium, I almost teared up."
3675,Date of experience: September 2018,25-Sep-18,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Sparty on,We love attending games here - there are no obstructed views and there are 4 huge screen monitors to see everything even better - the 'bench' seating is a bit tight and uncomfortable at times but you can always stand a lot- there are plenty of concession stands and rest rooms as well as a lot going on outside the stadium pre-game. We always park at Hope Road and Farm lane- they have really improved the parking situation here and there are a TON of shuttle busses which drop off and pick up behind the stadium by the student gate- it is actually walkable which we do for day games- it is $5 per person to ride the shuttle (RT) We have NEVER had any issue with rowdiness or rudeness and the band plays more than one song!
3677,Date of experience: September 2017,30-Mar-18,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Go Green !,Awesome stadium. I recommend to take the season ticket on Fall semester. Spartans are nice to see and the atmosphere is very different from Europe! Great discovery tho! I'd like to be back there once in my life. Go green !!
3678,Date of experience: November 2017,6-Mar-18,Big Ten,Michigan State,4,Love Games Here - Emergency Exiting is a Breeze,We had to leave in a hurry due to a hail and lighting storm during the last game we attended. Our side line seats were amazing. The spirit of the crowd is second to none.

3681,Date of experience: August 2017,6-Jan-18,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,the Home of Spartan Football,"there are no bad seats in Spartan Stadium, just better ones! unlike that other stadium in Ann Arbor, patrons actually have descent room to sit in and are not packed in like sardines for ego stroking purposes. State fans are passionate and loud!"
3682,Date of experience: November 2017,23-Dec-17,Big Ten,Michigan State,2,Visited for the MSU/Penn State game,"Longest game of my life. Evacuation of stadium was not handled well. They demanded we all leave the stadium. Told us to go over to another center, but never explained where that was."
3683,Date of experience: November 2017,5-Nov-17,Big Ten,Michigan State,4,Friendly stadium,"We came as a group supporting our visiting football team. The stadium was built around the same time as many of the other Big 10 stadiums. It seats about 80 thousand, so it??s a medium sized stadium.It is easy to walk to this facility. Entrances were odd. Our tickets said Gate L, but Gate L is entered after you go through Gate K and if you don??t ask, you don??t know where to enter.The visitors are in section 105, several ramps up. Similar to other stadiums. I do wish Big 10 schools would give visitors a chance for better seats.  On the other hand, there were no obstructions and so no bad view of the field- unlike at Ohio State.The restroom facilities near section 105 are awful. There??s nothing else to say about it.MSU people are very nice. There were only a couple of drunk & obnoxious students, that we saw. Most fans were friendly. Overall, I liked this stadium and would visit to watch our team again."
3684,Date of experience: September 2017,31-Oct-17,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Great place for memories and adrenaline,"I have been a Spartan fan since birth and I have been lucky enough to experience some of the greatest memories and adrenaline-rushing moments in that stadium. Little Giants, the Wisconsin hail mary, overtime vs UofM, Clockgate. The list goes on and on. There is nothing better than hearing the crowd getting fired up during a drive, or hearing them chant ""Go Green, Go White"". It sends shivers up my spine every time I think about it."
3685,Date of experience: September 2017,2-Oct-17,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Great Place to See a Big Ten Football Game,"Renovations keep making this venue better and better.It's easy to get around inside. There are many food choices.I love our West Upper Deck seats. Lines of vision are great.There are multiple large bathrooms and several concession stands with a few free standing food options. Take the ramp instead of the stairs, though. It's a long way up."
3686,Date of experience: September 2017,24-Sep-17,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Fantastic venue,"When to Spartan Stadium for the big MSU - Notre Dame game and had a great time.Stadium is fan friendly, comfortable and easy to get in and out.  Fans are great and respectful, which does not happen at other college venues.  Beautiful scoreboards that are visible from every seat.  Great food options as well."
3687,Date of experience: October 2016,16-Sep-17,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Loyal fans and fun tailgating summarize the spartan experince,Went to my first game here and had one of the best times of my life. I didn't attend a large university that had a division 1 football team so I didn't know what to expect. When I arrived there was a sea of green and white in the parking lots. I showed up at 10am for a noon game but boy was I late to the party. When I parked and set up it was a totally different world. Everyone was friendly and having a fun time. I ended making friends with some of the college students and joined in on a game of cornhole. After 2 hours of tailgating I attended the game. The energy in that stadium was insane. I felt like I was at an NFL game. I enjoyed the whole college game day experience at Michigan State. I will be throwing on my spartan green and going again in the near future.
3688,Date of experience: September 2017,6-Sep-17,Big Ten,Michigan State,4,great venue,Top notch entertainment venue. Some of the seating sections are VERY confusing. Sections 27 & 28 seating does not make sense . Someone needs to renumber the rows and seat numbers to match the section numbers.
3689,Date of experience: October 2016,11-Aug-17,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Enjoyed the Loyal Fans!,We were there visiting our MSU student for parents weekend and attended a Homecoming game.  We are graduates of another B1G school and have season tickets for our home stadium and Spartan Stadium blew us away.  What a fun environment and what I loved is how everyone sang the alma mater. We were surrounded by fans that are locals and support the team even if they did not go there.  That was amazing.  The team was having an off year but the fan support was still there.  It was a completely different experience than what we are use to. Our fan base is tepid at best. It was nice to see such loyal support and exciting environment.
3690,Date of experience: October 2016,15-Mar-17,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Spartan fans are the best!,"Win or lose, it is always fun to attend a game at Spartan Stadium. Fans are respectful and the stadium is easy to get around in. The new scoreboard is great as well as the music and graphics."
3691,Date of experience: September 2016,6-Mar-17,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Pretty stadium next to the Red Cedar River and in the center of campus!,"LOVE Spartan Stadium! It's a very attractive stadium in a beautiful location--next to the scenic Red Cedar River and in the center of campus. It is truly the heart of Michigan State University and as MSU is such a walking school, just love to watch everyone walking to the games from all directions, enjoying the beautiful campus and sharing the excitement with other Spartans! The parade passes by, the Spartans do their walk and the band and pep rally is just over the bridge! Great to place to visit on game day and have a great time!"
3692,Date of experience: October 2016,13-Feb-17,Big Ten,Michigan State,4,Great Place to watch a game!,"Spartan Stadium is a classic place to watch a Big 10 football game.  The atmosphere and excitement are hard to duplicate. The seats are relatively comfortable, particularly compared to those stadiums that pack too many people into the same space simply to say they have a certain number of folks at a game. Recent renovations have made it very convenient to get around and the concessions have added fairly unique dishes to try if you wish. Take your kids to the Spring game as it is free and a fantastic opportunity to experience the feel of a major stadium!!Enjoy!"
3693,Date of experience: October 2016,18-Jan-17,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Big Ten Football,If you have ever been to (or never been to) a Big Ten football game Spartan Stadium is the ideal venue. The stadium is not too big (compared to 'the Big House' or 'The Horseshoe') in that the fans are not separated from the playing field by the vastness of the aforementioned stadiums -- but large enough to get the full experience of college football.
3694,Date of experience: November 2016,15-Jan-17,Big Ten,Michigan State,3,"Cold/rainy, lost; but not a bad experience overall.","We went on November 19th, 2016 with my neighbor to see MSU take on Ohio State. It was rainy/snowy, and we lost bot not overall a bad experience; it could've been better, that's all. The view from our section was great, food was delicious, service was friendly and quick. first time for me personally. I'm not even an MSU fan, just wanted to go with my neighbor while he rooted for the Bucks."
3695,Date of experience: December 2016,14-Dec-16,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,A Great Place to Watch a Game,"I try to go a game a year (coming from KY). It always seems to be cold when I come, but I always have a great time. The tailgating is great. The stadium has plenty of food choices and tons of vendors during the game"
3696,Date of experience: October 2016,2-Nov-16,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Football Saturday,"Spartan Stadium is the best spot to cheer on our team. Unlike that other stadium which is the home of the ten inch butt, spartan stadium gives ample seating space. Go Green"
3697,Date of experience: September 2016,28-Oct-16,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Great view from any seat,went back for homecoming  seat on visitor side upperdeck   seat views are great no obstructions and easy access to restrooms and vendors one level down  clean stadium and tons of parking within walking distance  with some recent upgrades a great facility to visit
3698,Date of experience: October 2016,26-Oct-16,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,The best place to see Big Ten football in Michigan!,"We've visited several times, and it's been a great experience each time.  The fans and staff provide a friendly atmosphere for visitors.  You can bring your children to a game here.  Getting in and out is not difficult.  Concessions and restrooms are spread throughout the stadium.  Upper deck offers nice views of the MSU campus.  The views to the field are good."
3699,Date of experience: October 2016,21-Oct-16,Big Ten,Michigan State,4,No Bags Allowed!,"We attended the Homecoming game and I was impressed with the stadium. There are plenty of vendor stands of food and drink throughout, as well as bathrooms. The popcorn was delicious! Because we attend many NFL and college games, I assumed my clear regulation bag would be perfect. Someone saw me pregame and informed me that I would not be allowed in the stadium with it, so I asked a few women who regularly attend games here. And, yes, its true, no bag, clear or otherwise, or purse is allowed, but you may bring a Ziploc baggie. At first I was annoyed but then glad, as it is for our own safety. I kept my keys in my coat pocket, it's a good thing I had a coat with pockets, or I don't know what I would've done. The college is a smoke-free property, and it's too bad there's not some type of perimeter ordinance around the stadium because as soon as you come down the concourse, you're hit with second hand smoke everywhere! That was the only negative."
3700,Date of experience: October 2016,17-Oct-16,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,great place to watch big 10 football,"Hey, you can't win every game, but our Spartans have won plenty of games overall. This stadium, I'm told, holds a maximum of about 84,000 people, and it's usually pretty darn full.  We enjoy the energetic ambiance of other MSU students, faculty, staff and alumni at Homecoming, as I'm sure other Spartans fans do for every home game.  The stadium is well maintained and has a variety of concession stands, clean restrooms and good security.  Be aware that when attending sports events there to put your ID cards, credit cards and cash in your pocket or very small purse.  NO backpacks or stadium cushions with backs allowed; only unopened full water bottles and stadium cushions with no backs be taken into the stadium. Dress for the weather, which means if you think it is going to rain, bring rain gear, because most of the seating is out in the open."
3701,Date of experience: October 2016,10-Oct-16,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Great stadium and fans,"Was here for a BYU vs MSU game- BYU won, which is always interesting if you are the visiting fans. The fans here were great. Sat near the fifty yard line with long time MSU fans. Great football fans and very knowledgeable about game. The stadium in beautiful inside and out. The inner food areas are a little old, but still great especially compared to the big bucket of seats down the road in Ann Arbor, which I have also watched a game at. MSU stadium is far better."
3702,Date of experience: September 2016,7-Oct-16,Big Ten,Michigan State,3,"Decent collegiate stadium, not enough bathrooms, poor layout for vending","I came here with some friends for the Badgers/MSU football game.  The stadium is nice, but there are not enough bathrooms for the men or the women...very long lines for both, and there are relatively few vendor stands for food.  Plus, due to the layout of it all, the (very long) bathroom lines quickly run into the (nearly as long) vendor lines.  In both cases, the lines pretty much completely clog and block the ramps which are used to go from the lower levels to the upper levels."
3703,Date of experience: September 2016,26-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan State,4,Nice Big 10 Stadium,"The campus of MSU and Spartan Stadium are beautiful. It was our first trip and we all said we'd go back for another football game. Our seats were in the upper deck, and it was a good steep climb up the ramps to get up there. Once seated, we had a great view of the field. Being guests, we weren't sure what to expect from MSU fans, but we found them to be welcoming and friendly, even after Wisconsin beat them. Only complaint - the time it took to enter the stadium. Every fan was frisked, had to open or remove jackets, etc. We understand the safety issue, but wish we had known it would take so long to enter. We almost missed the kick off."
3704,Date of experience: September 2016,25-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan State,4,Go Green!,"The family and I visited Spartan Stadium yesterday for the Wisconsin game.  Unfortunately, Wisconsin beat the pants off of us, but the experience was still fun.The stadium itself is somewhat older, but it's still in great shape.  The bathrooms are fairly well accessible and it doesn't take too long to get in and out for a restroom break.  There are a lot of food choices in the stadium (the stuff you might expect) and the prices are in line with other venues.  The seating is set up as bench style seating except for a premium area that has bucket seats and also certain select seats have seat backs on them.  We always take a seat cushion along which makes things more comfortable.  Inside the stadium, most all the seats give a decent view.  On this recent occasion, we sat in section 6, which gave us a really good view.  If you miss any action on the field, there are several big ""jumbo-tron"" TV's to catch the replay.  The game announcer is very easy to hear and understand during the game.  Getting in and out of the stadium is fairly efficient as there are multiple exit/entrance points.  I love that Spartan Stadium uses real grass and not artificial turf.  The landscaping crew maintains the field very well.  This is a really great place to see a football game."
3705,Date of experience: September 2016,25-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Fabulous,"Great staff.  Friendly Michigan folks!  Very helpful for disabilities.  My husband had a walker and they helped get him seated and showed me where the walker could be stored at the Red Cross station.  When he was having some problems toward the end of the game, they were so helpful in assisting him at the Red Cross.  The stadium is beautiful"
3706,Date of experience: December 2015,12-Sep-16,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Best stadium EVER!!!,"Best food, seats, fans, everything!!!  All sorts of activities with the band, cheerleaders, Sparty..."

Good seats throughout.  Nothing can beat MSU Football in the fall. Try the ice cream sandwich cookie made at the MSU Dairy. An achievement in dairy decadence."

3709,Date of experience: November 2015,10-Aug-16,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Best stadium on a fall gameday,Stadium has had some nice updates. The area of campus surrounding it is great tailgate before a football game. Go Green
3710,Date of experience: October 2015,7-Jun-16,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Unbelievable atmosphere for Spartan Football,Spartan Stadium is an awesome venue for MSU Spartans Football.  I dont think it gets enough credit as a great stadium to watch a game.   I like to sit up high as to visualize the entire field and see the plays developing.   The tail gating is mad crazy too.  Great atmosphere.
3711,Date of experience: November 2015,28-Mar-16,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Awesome Stadium! A must see,"There's nothing like seeing a live MSU football game! The environment is awesome, crowds, students and team makes for a great weekend of fun! Clean, easy to get to and plenty of parking if you get here early. Plenty of places to eat or you can eat at the stadium. Lots of lighting for the night games."

I never leave unhappy.....even when we had to evacuate due to lightning. We sit in the upper deck and have the best view of the game, the city & sometimes the most amazing sunsets. Go see a game!! Go Green!!"
3715,Date of experience: November 2015,9-Feb-16,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,great stadium,Love it there. Great views considering the venue. Seats are a little tight for a normal sized person.
3716,Date of experience: September 2015,9-Feb-16,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Great Sports Venue,"For MSU Football fans, this is Mecca. Renovations have improved the experience greatly over the years but there are still some kinks to work out. Bathroom wait times are STILL not what they should be given the crowds they have and concessions on the upper level are repetitive and not very creative. Other BIG venues have superior food concessions but MSU still seems stuck in the 70's with their offerings. Could use some large elevators to bring up the older fans to the upper level which is fairly common to the larger BIG stadiums. Wondering if this would help the older fans keep their season tickets?"
3717,Date of experience: November 2015,15-Dec-15,Big Ten,Michigan State,4,Best place to be on a football Saturday,"Home of Michigan State football. If you want to experience a Big 10 football game, this is the place. We have had season tickets for a very long time. There are lots of things to do before the game, tailgating is always a good choice. Watching the team March to the game is great. Watching the MSU band March and perform, has too be high on your list. They have all kind of different packages, if you can not make all the games. It is a friendly place even to  the fans of team we are trying to beat. No alcohol is allowed in the stadium, there are no bags allowed in the stadium. There are good parking place, where you can get a bus and ride to the stadium. The bus lot is located on Farm Lane. Food is expensive at the game, but if you tailgate, you do not need to buy food at the game. However, on a cool fall day, the hot chocolate hits the spot. Come visit the campus and enjoy a true family event."
3718,Date of experience: November 2015,29-Nov-15,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,MSU vs PSU,"Final game of the 2015 season.  My husband is a grad and we currently reside in PA but grew up in MI.  Family still there so we returned for Thanksgiving and the game.  A tip, we parked and tailgated at a church that's very walkable to the stadium.  They charged $15 to park however they also open the church to use the inside, warm, clean restrooms!  So worth it over porta johns.  Also easy off/on as it's located on Trowbridge Rd.  The stadium itself is awesome.  Nothing like watching your team win with thousands of fans who feel like you do!  Another FYI I bought a clear Spartan cross body small purse that is supposed to be allowed in.  One guard checking the line approved it and when I got to the gate a girl almost denied me entry.  She told me only ziploc bags are allowed.  Seriously that has got to be changed.  Mine was no bigger than a quart ziploc bag and see through just the same."
3719,Date of experience: November 2015,18-Nov-15,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,So close to the action!,"This is not a creature comfort facility, but it is great if you want to get as close as possible to the field, with 75,005 of Spartan faithful."
3720,Date of experience: October 2015,4-Nov-15,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Go GREEN!,"As an alumna, I bleed green and white but IMHO this is the most beautiful stadium on the most beautiful campus anywhere!  There are 3 big screens that use the latest technology for easy viewing and a ""banner"" at one end of the stadium that displays scores from around the country and very cool graphics."
3721,Date of experience: October 2015,26-Oct-15,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Great Football,I had the best time in the stadium the other day when the team played Indiana. We won and the team played excellent. It is a great place for a day of football. The concession stand lines can get long but the hot dogs are really good and it is a great way to spend the day when football is in season. The team should be very proud of themselves on how they are playing. Very good vibe here.
3722,Date of experience: October 2015,24-Oct-15,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Great day for a game,Took the kids to their first game and it was a blast!  Spent a bit more on tickets but had great seats about 20 rows back near the 40 yard line on the south side.  Worth the money!  Great spots to see the half time show.  Not enough bathrooms for a crowd that large so don't drink a lot before you go.  Will definitely go back!
3723,Date of experience: October 2015,11-Oct-15,Big Ten,Michigan State,4,spartans,Great venue..very close to fieldOse to field. Food below average. Great campus.....beautiful setting for stadium.
3724,Date of experience: September 2015,27-Sep-15,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,"Loud, Full and Fun","We had a large group. We tailgated before and after the game. We were in the nosebleed section, but it was great. We could really see all the plays, the band formations and the dog catching the frisbee. The atmosphere was energetic. The view of the campus was pretty, too. The bleacher seats were typical bleacher seats. Luckily we had aisle seats. Sitting in the middle could be difficult for getting in and out. Finding your seat is easy. There are signs and directions every where. It is very family friendly."
3725,Date of experience: September 2015,1-Sep-15,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Great Place to See a Game,"We have been to Spartan Stadium many times over the years and find it to be a great place to see a game. We have sat in most areas of the stadium and there are really no bad seats. Each area really gives you a different perspective of the game. Obviously the higher up you go the wider your perspective but you are also farther away. Concessions are pretty good for a college stadium with quite a few specialty foods available. No alcohol anywhere in the Big 10. Large restrooms where the line, even if long, moves pretty fast. Parking is plentiful on campus and all of the lots are great for tailgating. Nothing better to do on a warm fall Saturday in East Lansing."
3727,Date of experience: November 2014,8-Jul-15,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,A Wonderful Stadium for Football,"Spartan Stadium is the best. What a wonderful atmosphere to watch a football game. Seating is comfortable, Spartan football is exceptional, the band is world renowned, the fans are fun, access to and from the stadium is excellent, and tailgating is outstanding. This is a wonderful venue for families, business entertaining, and of course great college football."
3728,Date of experience: November 2014,5-Jun-15,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Home of the Legendary Spartans!,"The new improvements have made this great stadium even better! You can see what is happening on the field clearly, thanks to the humongous screens. I am short and if all everyone stands to see a play, I would miss it if not for the screens. They pack a lot of people in but it is not ridiculous as say that other school down 94, where you're packed in like sardines. We get the seat backs with our annual tickets and it makes it a lot nicer.  At its core, this place is well organized. They can get thousands of people in and out quickly, thanks to well trained staff and many exits/enterances. Everything you need is here from traditional stadium food to Spartan gear at ground level. The bathrooms are usually clean and don't go downhill till later second half. Buses run efficiently back to the parking areas - we are sometimes surprised at how fast to get in and out considering all the people.  The real fun is the tailgating surrounding, so if you come to the game, come early and catch that show!  This review covers Fall football..."
3729,Date of experience: August 2014,23-Mar-15,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Even though  I am a Buckeye fan  this is a nicer stadium,The cleanest football stadium I ever been too.  Like Ohio State there is a Huntington  club.The field is so lovely.
3730,Date of experience: December 2014,6-Jan-15,Big Ten,Michigan State,4,Daughters Prom,"This is a great place to watch a football game, but the addition of banquet & gathering facilities is perfect. Our daughters prom was located here, it was very roomy & a fabulous view of the field!"
3731,Date of experience: November 2014,24-Nov-14,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,Go STATE!,"Spartan Stadium just got a recent upgrade with the new North End Zone project. Extra spacious suites are available for those that want to take in football in luxury. It's always a fun experience to watch a game here with easy entry, decent food and the Spartan's continuing to win. Ohio State be damned."
3732,Date of experience: October 2014,6-Nov-14,Big Ten,Michigan State,3,Not bad,Even as a Michigan fan (not Michigan State) I have to say it was a decent stadium.  No long lines for concessions or bathroom.  All the seats looked to have a decent view of the field.
3733,Date of experience: September 2014,1-Oct-14,Big Ten,Michigan State,5,My favourite college football stadium to visit,"Have been here a few times and it is just about always sold out or near capacity. This makes for a great atmosphere, especially when you are sitting closer to the band and student section.Great fight song and other songs and very cool and clever chanting from the students."
3735,Date of experience: November 2020,10-Nov-20,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Nice looking stadium.,The stadium is easily walkable from the campus.  It??s big and looks pretty modern. The area around it was nice. A good place to see a game.
3736,Date of experience: January 2020,16-Apr-20,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,VIP Box,Awesome opportunity to be in the beautiful VIP skybox at the University of Minnesota's football stadium.The event was sponsored by Coca Cola which provided awesome hors d'oeuvres for USA Swimming coaches & officials attending at U.S. Junior Nationals.    A great looking stadium. Maybe one day a game.
3737,Date of experience: November 2019,24-Feb-20,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Love my Gophers football home,"A great place to see My Gophers or other events at The Bank.  Good food selection options.  Sit on the sunny side during cold weather, sit on the shady side when it is hot out.  Try out some good food options in the end zone plaza area."
3738,Date of experience: November 2019,1-Feb-20,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Big Game,"My husband and I attended the Badger/Gopher game.  Being from Wisconsin and having graduated from the U of MN, I was going to leave a winner no matter what!  The weather was memorable (rain, sleet, snow) which only added to the atmosphere.  We had a fantastic time.  The stadium is beautiful."
3739,Date of experience: October 2019,3-Jan-20,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Nice Stadium!,Very nice NCAA football stadium with decent food and beverage (including alcohol) choices. Fun tailgating on game days. Easy to get to. Doesn't seem like there's a bad seat in the house.
3740,Date of experience: October 2019,14-Nov-19,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Great stadium experience.,"Perfect day for football and a win against Maryland.  Nice stadium and fun activities throughout the game.  Good food and drink options, easy to get around, good view from every seat.  Fun fans!"
3741,Date of experience: November 2019,10-Nov-19,Big Ten,Minnesota,3,OK stadium,"I attended the Penn State game.  Warning!1. The Men's Restroom lines were long (30 minutes at halftime).  The concourse was much larger than the old Metrodome, still it was too crowded and difficult to move.  Concession lines were also long.  2. Get a bench seat!  The seats with permanent chair-backs are TINY and not as comfortable!  I do not know why you would sit down when you should be cheering.3.  There is not a bad seat in the stadium.  Even the cheapest seat has great sight lines."
3742,Date of experience: October 2019,14-Oct-19,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Nice stadium with welcoming fans,"Went to the Nebraska vs. Minnesota game last weekend. Generally speaking, the Minnesota fans were incredibly nice and showed great sportsmanship. We had some people behind us that ran their mouths during the whole game (but didn??t know what a safety was). And a handful talking crap outside of the game. But the Minnesota fans in front of us and next to us were beyond friendly and truly great fans. The stadium itself was beautiful and speaking from a female standpoint, it was great not standing in line for what seems like hours to use the restroom. A Minnesota fan explained that that was one of the things they prioritized in this stadium and it may sound silly, but it was a nice perk. Ladies, I know you understand this. Lol The stadium also had regular folding seats vs bench style seats. I think the biggest disappointment aside from the handful of rude fans was the fact that their fans didn??t even show up to support their undefeated Gophers. It was cold and snowing during the game. I understand and completely get it. However, the Huskers are having a mediocre season at best (that??s probably being generous for my team) and there are still 90,000+ fans that show up for each game at Memorial stadium every Saturday. And they stay all four quarters, regardless of rain, shine, snow, blizzard, etc.... even when Ohio State is dominating us. For a team that??s having the success Minnesota is having this season, you??d expect their fans to cheer them on in record fashion regardless of the weather. But that wasn??t the case. I??d go back in a heartbeat though. If you??re in MN on a college football Saturday or want to travel to support your college team, I??d highly recommend visiting MN. Thank you for the hospitality, Gopher fans."
3743,Date of experience: October 2019,14-Oct-19,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Best. Stadium. Ever.,There is nothing as amazing as Viking fans and going to a game is a NFL must. What an amazing time we had!
3744,Date of experience: October 2019,5-Oct-19,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Awesome Facility,The stadium is a great place to see a game.  Parking is ok with a short walk.   All seats give a good view.  Lots of concessions and metchandise
3745,Date of experience: September 2019,14-Sep-19,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Went to a football game,While in town I attended a Minnesota Gopher football game. I thought it had a very good game day atmosphere.
3746,Date of experience: August 2019,4-Aug-19,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Family day,"Went for gopher open practice with family unfortunately got called off because of lighting.    Not a bad seat in the house.  Stadium is starting to show age and being exposed to Minnesota weather, hopefully the U will take care of it and the grounds."
3747,Date of experience: August 2018,27-Jul-19,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Great place to see a game!,"Went to the last Loons game there. It was a blast. The cheese curds are huge! Have been to Gopher games here too. They were great too. Parking is tricky, and eating before or after a game at anywhere near the stadium is almost impossible."
3748,Date of experience: November 2018,2-Jul-19,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Great Venue!,Great venue for all things Sports Concerts etc. Easy to get around great sight lines fast and multiple food outlets. Has it all. Great atmosphere on Saturdays for Big 10 football!
3752,Date of experience: November 2018,23-Feb-19,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,A Fun Place to Go!,We went with family to a Viking game.  The Staff working at the Stadium is Superior!!  It was a great family experience!
3753,Date of experience: November 2018,6-Nov-18,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Go to a game here!,"Great sightlines, friendly staff every event I have attended over the years. If you have never gone you should be aware that due to the location of the stadium, half of the stadium is almost always shaded. Easy to get to, park and get around. Next to a high number of restaurants and bars within a short walk of the stadium."
3754,Date of experience: October 2018,30-Oct-18,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,"Pretty Good Venue, not Super Modern, though","I saw the final FC Minnesota home game of 2018 and the place was packed with fans.  Not the most modern seating and facilities but only a strong walk from downtown (if the weather's good).  Fireworks after the game were cool, too."
3755,Date of experience: November 2017,3-Oct-18,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Cold MN football when weather is cold.,"If you like cold football outside, this is your venue.  I prefer the US Bank Stadium when it is cold, but this is college football and should be played outside.  Nice and new with lots of food options.  Fun university atmosphere."
3756,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Oct-18,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Quite Nice Stadium...,"Recently attended a MNUFC soccer game with my family, this was my first time visiting this stadium. And to my surprise it is VERY nice! Clean and comfortable stadium seats. What shocked me the most were the bathrooms, they are so tidy! And bonus they are heated!! This was a wonderful surprise for me b/c it was cold for this soccer game. I really, really like this stadium - can??t wait to go again! Go Loons!!"
3757,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Oct-18,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Minnesota United Soccer...Awesome.,The Minnesota United Soccer team played at TCF stadium the past two seasons and it was awesome.  It is a great time.  Visit them next year at their new Allianz Field.
3759,Date of experience: September 2018,26-Sep-18,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Great stadium....for all sports!!,"I??ve been to an NCAA Football game, NCAA Hockey Game, NFL game, NHL game, and an MLS game in this stadium and always had a great time! Beautiful college outdoor stadium. You immediately climb a good amount of stairs to get to the first concourse. Of course there is plenty of accessible access. Good vendors and food. Great access to the university and city life surrounding it. Easy access to public transportation including the light rail."
3760,Date of experience: August 2018,16-Sep-18,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Nice stadium. Not a bad seat in the place,This is a good stadium. Any tickets you buy are good seats! Even in the second level. Good for Vikings and United games.
3761,Date of experience: September 2018,9-Sep-18,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Loved it,My first ever college football game. Great stadium with great facilities. Also sells alcohol which was a bonus for me. Dry accessible and in a good neighbourhood
3762,Date of experience: August 2018,4-Sep-18,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,BEAUTIFUL stadium to watch the Gophers game!,"My dad and I came from Kalamazoo, Michigan to check out a Gophers game and we were very impressed by the experience that we had while at the stadium. Leaving the football game itself aside, I'll try to explain how I came to my conclusion.Pros:The architecture of the stadium, stands and hallways is very well constructed to allow for an efficient and pleasant experience. There are a wide variety of amenities that are available to patrons, like an open food court area to hang out and enjoy your meal, wheelchair accessibility and multiple scoreboards. The acoustics of the stadium are better than a lot of other places we've gone as it wasn't too noisy or echoed.The staff at the stadium were very friendly and willing to accommodate you. We got a lot of helpful tips of places to eat, good places to stand to get better pictures and just an overall pleasant attitude from everyone we met. It made the whole experience that much better!The other cool thing is that there aren't really any ""bad"" seats for watching a game. We had seats that weren't close and still had a great view of the game and scoreboard so you never have to worry about being as close as you can to get a ""good"" seat here!Cons:The tickets for our event were a little pricey, so I'm not sure if that is because of the hype for the football season or because of the venue, but even getting them second hand cost about $100 for two tickets in the mid-level. If you're going with a group make sure to look around for good deals! Overall, we had a great time watching football, relaxing and enjoying a beautiful night game at TCF Bank Stadium. Enjoyed the experience and would definitely come back from Michigan again someday to do it again!"
3765,Date of experience: August 2018,9-Aug-18,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Great stadium,The stadium for being rather new has a great classic vibe to it. The site lines are good from everywhere. Fun place.
3766,Date of experience: August 2018,6-Aug-18,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Great venue - football or soccer!,"Having been to 7-8 college stadiums, TCF is a great venue with good views from almost anywhere in the stadium.  We actually prefer the upper deck as the views are better (and tickets are less expensive).  As far as tailgating, sure there are better stadiums out there (e.g. Penn State), but I can think of several (e.g. Michigan, Camp Randall, Oregon State, UConn) that simply don't have the parking lot space that allows for a fun atmosphere.  And each lot seems to have it's own ""personality"" which makes it fun to tailgate-hop pre-game.  Having been to a couple MN United games, it's an really fun time for a pretty inexpensive ticket (of course, they'll be in their own stadium come next year, but until then).  The only disappointing aspect is when Badger fans come to town and make you disappointed in the human race.  Other than that, it's always a great time!!"
3773,Date of experience: September 2017,19-Jun-18,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Great Stadium,I'm a season ticket holder for Gopher football and I have sat in many seats at TCF Stadium.  Theres not a bad seat in the place!
3774,Date of experience: October 2017,30-May-18,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Beautiful Stadium!,I absolutely Love this stadium!  It is great that we still have an outdoor stadium to watch football.
3775,Date of experience: October 2017,18-May-18,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Went for a couple events,"The stadium is great. I just wish the seating was better. A lot of corner seats are metal bleachers. On a cold day, this can be uncomfortable."
3777,Date of experience: October 2017,9-May-18,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Great views,"It doesn't really matter where you sit. Every vantage point has a great view. I've seen numerous games here (NFL and college) and have never had a bad view. I've sat in the student section, upper deck, and 50 yard line. Have had a great experience each time."
3780,Date of experience: October 2017,23-Jan-18,Big Ten,Minnesota,3,Multi-use facility for the University and others,Nice venue with good seats everywhere.  If it is chilly make sure that you try and get on the north side where the sun hits.
3781,Date of experience: November 2017,17-Jan-18,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Nice stadium,"We visited here in November and the stadium is very nice, especially for a college stadium. There were plenty of amenities and the seating was fairly comfortable."
3782,Date of experience: October 2017,8-Jan-18,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Mnufc has been amazing in the stadium,"My family and I have seen many MNUFC soccer games in the past year and this is an amazing place to go watch soccer! The food is a bit pricey and parking is not easy so we take the light rail, we go on the blue line first and then we take the green line over to TCF Bank Stadium!"
3783,Date of experience: October 2017,21-Dec-17,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Place where college sports are practiced,"This is a relatively modern facility which houses championships in a variety of sports. My visit there was to attend the university fencing championship, but there are many other sports activities throughout the year."
3784,Date of experience: November 2017,26-Nov-17,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Beautiful Stadium - Comfy Seats - NO LINE FOR LADIES RESTROOM!,"We came for the Badgers vs Gophers Nov. 25th game.  Even though they are rivals, everyone was so friendly.  This stadium is amazing - spacious, clean, comfy seats, and for the first time in my life....I didn't miss one minute of the game because I was stuck in a long line waiting to use the restroom.  Well played, Minnesota!  We loved your band, too!"
3785,Date of experience: October 2017,18-Nov-17,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Excellent stadium....great scenario to enjoy a College game !!,"We went to a Golden Gophers game and we really enjoyed the experience, stadium is nice and comfortable, just take your precautions (ponchos, raincoats, etc...) as this is an open stadium the weather is against you; the seats that we choose were excellent, this stadium is very well designed that almost in every seat that you select you'll have excellent views of the game !"
3786,Date of experience: October 2017,5-Nov-17,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,MLS Loons Temp Home,"A short pit stop for the MLS Loons while home is built in nearby St. Paul, TCF Bank Stadium isn't too bad for this newly minted team. I have attended other MLS matches out west and most of those also play in NCAAF / NFL stadiums. TCF Bank Stadium has a great vibe to it, easily accessible form MSP metro and the nearby UofM. Downfall to the stadium, interior use for vendors isn't the most friendly for game day visitors. Vendors and access points for seating leaves long winding lines where patience must be a virtue. As others have remarked, bathrooms are plentiful and we avoided the food as many friends have commented it's overpriced and subpar to Jack in the Box. Game day experience once you're in the seat, first class. Had a great time watching the Loons and look forward to their new home in 2019."
3787,Date of experience: October 2017,23-Oct-17,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Love THE BANK,"We have had season tickets in the past, but we were here for Homecoming this year.  I was really disappointed in the security at entry.  We stood in line for AT LEAST 30 minutes and we missed kickoff.  This has never happened to us before and I hope it never happens again. Other than that, the stadium has plenty of food options and for you ladies, PLENTY of bathrooms!"
3788,Date of experience: October 2017,22-Oct-17,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Awesome place to see a game,"Great place to see a game.  The place is basically brand new and well maintained.  The u??s customer service is amazing.  Just text if you have a question or issue.  I wanted to find family restrooms and texted their help line.  90 seconds later, I had what I needed.  I was in the 200 level and I loved my sight lines."
3789,Date of experience: October 2017,17-Oct-17,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Gopher football game,The stadium is fun and offers great viewing throughout. There are plenty of food vendors. The marching band makes the day complete!
3790,Date of experience: November 2016,10-Oct-17,Big Ten,Minnesota,3,Why is there an outdoor stadium in MN?,"I live here all year around, and am not really into seeing live sports to be honest. I was asked to go with a friend to see some college play the gophers, and yeah I was freezing. I don't get it, maybe the love of the sport was supposed to over come me and warm me up, but I thought it was stupid they didn't offer hot drinks other than coffee to warm me up. I feel like they could make a mint off of females being dragged along and could off them baileys and hot chocolate, or rum chatta. Not my cup of tea for a venue, but everyone else seems to love it."
3791,Date of experience: September 2017,7-Oct-17,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,A fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon,Catching a University of Minnesota Gophers game is a 'must do' if you're in town over a weekend.  The stadium and campus is a short drive from central Minneapolis and there is a taxi/Uber stand right out front on University Avenue.  It's a large stadium but only rarely do they sell it out.  Best to get a seat on the east side so you have the sun keeping you warm during the game.  There's a large team store and plenty of food options to choose from (though they tend to run out of items by the third quarter!).
3792,Date of experience: September 2017,3-Oct-17,Big Ten,Minnesota,3,Nice college stadium.,"Good seating available in most areas. Ample selection of a wide variety of different foods. Very pricey, though, and expect to be carded each time you want to buy a beer."
3794,Date of experience: October 2016,24-Sep-17,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Many year Gopher Fan,"My family has had season tix to the Gopher Football games since I was in college.  We've seen games at the Memorial Stadium, The Metrodome and TCF Stadium.  Are big Marching Band fans.  Site lines are good. The home side gets a bit cold in the afternoon as the seats are shaded.  Not a bad thing.  If you can afford the ticket, I would encourage you to go.  It's fun to watch a Big 10 game in person."
3795,Date of experience: August 2017,8-Aug-17,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Great Soccer Experience with the Loons!,"We traveled from Seattle to watch our Sounders play Minneapolis United, and had a great time at the game.  Everybody was really friendly, even though we were with the opposing team...and we loved the cheese curds at the snack bar!The stadium is beautiful, and offered good sight lines.  Yes, there were football markings on the turf...but it didn't bother us as we also share a stadium with a football team."
3797,Date of experience: August 2016,10-Jul-17,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,College Football,Good outdoor stadium to watch college football.Even seen the Vikings play there in the 3rd coldest NFL football game ever when it was like -10 farenheight outside. Will never forget that game!!
3799,Date of experience: October 2016,8-Jul-17,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Fun place for a football game,Great atmosphere for a football game with some terrible parking.  Gophers are on the shaded side if it is warm (other side is in the sun most of the game).  Really a fun place to see a game.
3806,Date of experience: October 2016,30-Mar-17,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,college town Minnesota,"this is where the wide open college experience of sports, presents itself in Minnesota - Take in a game, you won't be disappointed."
3807,Date of experience: October 2016,22-Mar-17,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,High energy!,TCF Stadium is gorgeous! Not a bad seat in the place.  College games are so much fun to watch here and so much energy and excitement.  It's enjoyable to watch them play for the love of the game!
3808,Date of experience: October 2016,16-Mar-17,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Good place to watch a game,"Visited here to watch my team play and had a good time.  Just right sized stadium in a good location, and didn't run into any bad personalities"
3810,Date of experience: October 2016,17-Jan-17,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Fun place!,"Great place; good seating.  East side gets lots of sun in the afternoon, better sit on north or south side.  Great transportation to/from (train)--easy in, easy out.  Food is good, prices are average."
3811,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Jan-17,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Go Gophers!,"We spend lots of time in and around this stadium during football season! It is a great atmosphere. I love the energy that comes from the band and student section. Plus, who wouldn't want to see the best mascot around?I don't typically buy beer in the stadium, but it seems to have been a great addition that came from sharing the stadium with the Vikings a couple years back."
3814,Date of experience: September 2016,30-Dec-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,3,Upper level is not great,"Went here for the CSU-Minnesota game in Sept. 2016.Pros: Modern stadium with great amenities including: BEER. I know most colleges are moving to allow its sale in stadiums now, but it's still not common for college football. Being able to view the action from the concourse is awesome, so you never have to miss the action. I sat in the upper level, corner (visitors' section). The view of the field was not that great, but I've defintely seen worse.Cons: The video board that I could see was on the opposite corner & too small to really be effective. My biggest annoyance was the stairs to the upper level. They were narrow & had a 90 degree turn. Almost everytime I tried to go up or down it was congested & people had to walk at a snail's pace. The tailgate scene seemed to be really decentralized making it hit & miss."
3815,Date of experience: November 2016,9-Dec-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Great place to watch football,"I am not sure there is a bad seat in the place.  I went to three Gopher games there this year, and enjoyed every place I sat.  The sight lines were good.  Football played like it should be...outside!!"
3816,Date of experience: November 2016,25-Nov-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,this is a nice new stadium that still pays homage to the old memorial stadium,"good seating, with a large student section including the band. video board is huge. we were there for the northwestern game. was around 30 degrees. wasn't bad in the upper bowl until the sun went down.  if you are going to a later season game, sit on the north side of the stadium so you get some extra warmth from the sun.  concourses are nice and wide, and there are lots of restrooms.  there are a lot of places to eat and drink around the stadium.  the marching band is always excellent."
3817,Date of experience: November 2016,25-Nov-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Great Medium-Sized Stadium,"I visited TCF for the Northwestern - Gopher game. I've been to nearly every stadium in the Big Ten. This is the best stadium I have been to in the conference, holding aside the large venues like Ohio State, Michigan, and Penn State.Why?Easy in and out.Food is better than most. There's a sliced beef sandwich with melted cheese that's sold in the end zone.They sell beer in the stadium! Only other B1G stadium that does so is OSU.Great huge scoreboard.Real seats in sections x37-x44 and x07 to x14 (x = 100 or 200).Can be in the sun on the north side of the stadium (key on colder days).Bathrooms are clean and more numerous than other B1G stadiums.Great city views from certain locations in the stadium.Tickets are reasonable and are easy to get through the U or through secondary markets.TCF is not as loud as other stadiums because it is not completely enclosed. There aren't as many tailgating options as other stadiums in the B1G."
3818,Date of experience: November 2016,21-Nov-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,3,Gophers vs Northwestern,Met my old college dormmates for the game.  We had pregame at the Goal Line Club (GLC) at Williams Arena.  It was $30/person all you can eat and drink.  We warmed up for 2 hours before the game.  It was 30 degrees and windy.  Stadium was only half full.  It was actually windier in the lower bowl.  We had seats both in the lower section and the upper section.  40 yardline seats for both.  Seats had ice/snow on them.  Wasn't too bad if you are appropriately dressed.
3819,Date of experience: November 2016,10-Nov-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,GREAT COLLEGE STADIUM,"This is how stadiums should be built. 50,000 capacity with the ability to add on to 80,000 if they become successful again (last national championship in 1960).Horseshoe shaped for two tiers with the end zone one tier and also the location of a the huge scoreboard. Smaller board at the other end on top of the second tier.Sky boxes on one side. Most seating is actual seats but the the two tier end zone is benches (students sections) as are the end seating of the shoe towards the main scoreboard.Easy to get to as the metro will drop you off within 150 yards, and there are numerous places to eat or get a drink."
3820,Date of experience: September 2016,8-Nov-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Fun day to see the Gophers football team play!,We went to see the Minnesota Gophers play football. There is great food selections. It can get really crowded in the halls during half time. There is a large amount of women's bathrooms so hardly have to stand in line and wait. It is usually kept fairly clean. We sat in the lower area and had great view of the whole field. Would definitely visit again!
3821,Date of experience: November 2016,6-Nov-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Great College Stadium.  Tailgating needs some work though,"I love this stadium. It's new and has great views from the mezzanine, spacious bathrooms, great food and beer. It's like a mini NFL stadium. My out of state friends love it too."
3822,Date of experience: September 2016,4-Nov-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,great time,This is a very nice Stadium only down side it is out side and we all know what happens in MN in Jan.
3825,Date of experience: October 2016,20-Oct-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Very nice stadium,"A modern stadium, it has all you need. They have plenty of food and drink choices. They do serve beer. No waiting in any lines, though I think the game was about 15,000 below being sold out. The seating and views are excellent. Plenty of leg room."
3826,Date of experience: October 2015,28-Sep-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Cool games,"Nice game , I joined. Worthwhile to come earlier to the game to enjoy the atmosphere, tail riding or just looking for interesting people."
3827,Date of experience: September 2016,27-Sep-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Great place for a game,"Easy to get to, not a bad seat in the place, PA and video offer a good experience to go along with the game."
3828,Date of experience: December 2015,27-Sep-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Best Stadium in the Big 10,TCF Stadium is beautiful. Good seats anywhere. Serves alcohol too. Great college football experience. Parking can cost 30-40.00 relatively close to the stadium. Get there early cuz you have to go through metal detector screening but it not bad.
3829,Date of experience: September 2016,13-Sep-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Go Gophers,Excellent venue to enjoy a MN Gopher football game. Support our team and attend a game soon. Parking is plentiful and the team looks pretty good this year.
3830,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,VISITOR SIDE IS THE SUNNY SIDE and OTHER TIPS! READ THIS FIRST,We went to see the Golden Gofers home game against Indiana State. We bought our seats on line for $55 ($140 for the pair with fees) to sit in the second row on the 40 yard line. The fans were great making it a fun experience. Food was reasonably priced 'bottomless popcorn for $6.50...$6 bratwurst. There is parking further out for $20 and $35 close in but that may vary by game. We saw large shuttles arriving so there may be cheap parking with some advance planning. Stadium was nice...cheap seats don't have backs and you may want to 'rent' a cushion. You cannot bring in even a SMALL FANNY PACK!
3831,Date of experience: October 2015,29-Aug-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Great college football stadium...,Just an awesome place to catch gopher football. First class as always with U Of M. If only the team could put some wins  together and get to a rose bowl. Hopefully in my lifetime.
3832,Date of experience: August 2016,29-Aug-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,3,Great Stadium -with great facilities and transportation.,Loved walking around the stadium grounds and marveled at its design. The day we arrived the stadium was actually hosting a soccer game between Chelsea and AC Milan.
3833,Date of experience: October 2015,26-Aug-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Fun weekend watching the Gopher game!,"Visited my daughter @ UMN and we went to the Gopher game.  What a hoot!  We sat in the student section--just bleachers, but filled with energy!  Loved watching the ""Pride of Minnesota"" on the field and of course, Goldy is never boring!  Its so much better to attend a college football game instead of watching it on TV.  Go Gophers!"
3836,Date of experience: October 2015,1-Aug-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,If only,"There is nothing better than college football, except maybe college basketball; the pros just don't measure up despite all the hype. If there are any drawbacks to this experience, they are two-fold: first, the Gophers haven't exactly been knocking em dead lately; and second, the price of the tickets and the requisite ""contribution"" to the athletic fund have increased rather dramatically in the last few years. As a result, there are usually seats available. In other words, it's not the SEC, or Ohio State, Michigan, Michigan State, Wisconsin, or Iowa. But it is a great college stadium."
3840,Date of experience: October 2015,16-Jun-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,A Great Venue For Football and Soccer,I've had the chance to visit TCF Stadium for Minnesota Gopher and Vikings games as well as an exhibition match between Olympiakos and Manchester City in 2014.  It's a wonderful venue for a game!
3848,Date of experience: November 2015,20-Apr-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Nice little stadium,"Have been to a couple NFL games here. Weather can be freezing or beautiful depending on the season, but I have enjoyed every game none the less. Enjoyed games here more than the old Metrodome. Seats aren't too small, and the crowd is usually pretty friendly."
3849,Date of experience: December 2015,14-Apr-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Great final Vikings season outdoors,"I had end zone seats.  I felt I could see every play.  The stadium is clean and well maintained, and there are always plenty of bathrooms for women.  So rare at a sports venue!  Just wish there were some more high-end food options."
3850,Date of experience: October 2015,11-Apr-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Best all-new stadium in the Big Ten,"We've been here for Minnesota games with our U of M daughter. Crowd is Minnesota nice, but involved. Band is great and the student section lively from a distance. Sightlines are fantastic everywhere in this stadium. I recommend upgrading to a seatback chair over a bench seat. Beer is sold--a unique NCAA feature and welcome at that!!!   Having attended a Wisconsin game the weekend before, the crowd is less involved here. But with a Northwestern game the week after being here, U of M is far more awake and interested. In fact, Northwestern should seriously consider upgrading and remodeling Dyche Stadium (Ryan Field) using the club seats and other upscale--but affordable--seats and amenities of this stadium. Friendly people and stadium."
3851,Date of experience: November 2015,10-Apr-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,"Meh, okay","I've been to a number of Big Ten stadiums. This one is definitely not my favorite. It's pretty small, compared to other Big Ten sized stadiums. The amenities are okay. For those that like beer, they serve it. However, that means some rowdy crowds. Some like that, I, personally, don't like dealing with intoxicated jerks. The sight lines are decent. There isn't a bad seat on the house. Windy though. One end is wide open, so if the wind is blowing in from that side be prepared"
3852,Date of experience: September 2015,5-Apr-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Great Stadium,"Being from Iowa, I'm used to be crammed inside of Kinnick for football games. Being able to have enough room for a reasonably sized human being (I'm 6'1"") was nice. The stadium also had nice accommodations. As this was a college game and we'd done some tailgating, I can't talk to the quality of the food or beverages that were served inside the stadium but really enjoyed the seating and views."
3854,Date of experience: September 2015,24-Mar-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Great college football stadium.,"Not a bad seat in the place.  Great views of downtown Minneapolis and the campus through the open end of the horseshoe.  The brick facade looks great and meshes well with the more modern suite area.  Seats about 50,000."
3855,Date of experience: December 2015,23-Mar-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Gophers Football Game,We were entertained in the President's Suite at TCF bank stadium and it was a great place to watch a football game. TVs to show the replays etc. Food was great with a bar to serve us drinks.
3856,Date of experience: December 2015,18-Mar-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Great venue for some football,Watched the Vike's beat the Bears at the Bank this fall.  It was a little chilly but what a great outdoor stadium.  Love the open air and the excitement of the game.
3858,Date of experience: September 2015,16-Mar-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Solid Stadium!,"Stadium is easy to get to, parking was easy, seats were incredible, as we walked around the stadium it seems like every seat was offering a great and perfect view, great view of the downtown area."
3859,Date of experience: November 2015,16-Mar-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Great Venue -,"My daughter and son in law gave me tickets to the Viking/Packer game back in November. Never been to an NFL game before and what a great experience. The first thing was getting in the stadium - security check points as expected - but they ran quickly and efficiently and the people were very friendly.Secondly this facility was clean. Being fairly new it's also in good repair..Finding our seats was really easy, and again the staff were very helpful. Costs for food and drink were spendy but not totally outrageous - I would suggest not going really hungry or thirsty and you'll be fine.Finally I have to say something about the fans. Since it was a Vikings / Packer game there was a good number (35% maybe) of Packer fans, including myself. At least in the section I was in while there was some good nature ribbing going on everyone treated one another with respect. What more could you ask for.  I'll never be a Vikingd fan - but they have great fans."
3860,Date of experience: January 2016,14-Mar-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Not a bad seat in the house,Went to see the Seahawks play the Vikings for both the regular season and playoff game during the 2015 season. Vikings fans are friendly (mostly) and there is not a bad seat in the house. Literally sat in the very top row and had a great vantage point.
3862,Date of experience: November 2015,23-Feb-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Love this on campus stadium!,We have season tickets for Gopher Football and love to come to the stadium!  Many memories.  Does get a bit cold on the West side in the late afternoon during the late fall so pick your seats accordingly.
3867,Date of experience: January 2016,18-Feb-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Nice outdoor venue.,Great facility. Really enjoyed seeing the Vikings here and experiencing football the Old Minnesota cold way. Brrrrrr.
3868,Date of experience: October 2015,17-Feb-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,3,"Beautiful stadium, horrible parking","Truly lovely stadium.  A nightmare for parking and getting to stadium from the highway.  If you don't care about that, you'll have a great experience"
3869,Date of experience: October 2015,17-Feb-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Great venue,"Gophers, Vikings, concerts...this is a great venue. The concourse is wide and makes crowd moving fast and easy. There's a nice variety of vendors. The seating is comfortable. And the game atmosphere is great so go to a Gopher football game! Park easily at Coffman Union (usually cash only for games) and walk the few blocks. The UMN campus is so much fun. There are plenty of restaurants and bars nearby on campus, too."
3870,Date of experience: October 2015,14-Feb-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Not a bad seat in the place,"Have been to TCF for Gopher and Viking games. Have sat on the end zone and up in the top row. There are no bad seats in the place and if you want to change to a lower level seat when they become available no one cares if you do. Unlike Target field where they hassle you for even looking at a different seat, TCF Bank stadium gets it. Parking is $10-$25 but I park ten blocks away and walk. Its a nice walk on a fall day. I parks two blocks east of the light rail stop. Fun place"
3871,Date of experience: October 2015,3-Feb-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Great place to view a game.,"Have been to this stadium a half dozen times and it is a great experience every time.  The views of the Minneapolis skyline are always nice as well.  Food is typical stadium fare, but a better selection than most with the exception of Target Field which sets the standard."
3873,Date of experience: December 2015,13-Jan-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Vikings vs. Giants,"Flew from Maine to see the Vikings host the Giants with my son for his 10th birthday.  It was cold - about 10 degrees - and we had cheap seats high in the second deck corner.  Yet the view of the field was excellent, and the stadium rocked with excitement.  The good was decent (the only draw back was it froze after two minutes thanks to the temperature).  The Gophers have a good home, and it served the Vikings well as a temporary home for two years.  Ease of access via metro, good efficient seating and security."
3874,Date of experience: January 2016,13-Jan-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,1,Easy acess by Light Rail,"These people do not take safety and security seriously. None of the contents of bags and pockets were checked upon entry. Bottles of alcohol were everywhere as a result.One of the local team's fans was so drunk he stripped to his underwear. The only thing that security did, was to ask him to put his pants back on. He continue to swear loudly and knock peoples hats off in sub Zero weather.I will NEVER RETURN to this stadium."
3875,Date of experience: December 2015,10-Jan-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Game Day,Very well organized vendors. Many bathroom locations therefore no lines.  Cooler in the  concourse than I expected for being an outside stadium.
3876,Date of experience: December 2015,7-Jan-16,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Fun!,Great outdoor stadium!  I have enjoyed many Vikings games here....even on the cold days!  Not a bad seat in the house and lots of parking options and tailgating!
3877,Date of experience: November 2015,31-Dec-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,3,Gophers,"I would of rated higher but the day I was there it was cold and windy.  I miss the old dome.  Still don't think outdoor football in Minnesota is needed.  The stadium is nice but when it is cold out, there is no place to warmup!"
3878,Date of experience: November 2015,20-Dec-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Great place to see a Vikings game!!,"We were in town for Vikings vs Packers.We have been to many NFL stadiums and TCF Bank stadium was a nice change. Due to the size all the seats give you a good view. It was a cool Sunday afternoon, watching the game outdoors was great. The food we had was good, and the pricing wasn't outrageous. All the attendants and vendors we interacted with were  polite and friendly, even when they were confronted with some inebriated customers who could be quite offensive.The big screen was good so we could catch any action we missed.It will be a shame when the Vikings move back indoors into their new stadium next fall. One tip, bring a seat cushion as the seats are hard plastic or benches, the seat cushion is more comfy and keeps you warm, we had one than one person comment on how smart we were to bring our own."
3879,Date of experience: December 2015,11-Dec-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,3,Not meant to be an NFL stadium,"Enjoyed the atmosphere and the weather was great the first game we went to. However, I missed most of the third quarter waiting to use the rest room. Not set up to hold that many people. Very nice place for gopher games and a good quick fix until new stadium is ready."
3880,Date of experience: August 2015,10-Dec-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,"Freezing, but loving it","of us went to the Minnesota vs. Illinois game Nov. 21.We were in section 232, row 20, seat 3-6, great seats .No  bad views anywhere. Friendly crowd, lots of entertainment and Ski- U-Mah!. Lots of great choices to eat. We were visiting from Ohio, but had a great time getting involved with the crowd. It's a very friendly stadium, but dress warm in layers .we  parked at the fair grounds and took the shuttle in. Easy in, easy back to the car."
3881,Date of experience: December 2015,9-Dec-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Fantastic Place for a football game,"I've been to a number of stadiums to watch football games, and TCF has to be right up there. Honestly there is not a bad seat in the house. The bathrooms are easy to get too and the people working that stands are very nice."
3882,Date of experience: November 2015,29-Nov-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,2,Truly a disappoint design and super inefficient!!!,Went to the Wisconsin badgers Minnesota gophers football game and it was just an absolutely pathetic experience from the stadium design perspective. You walk in and you walk up stairs with no escalators. You can't even maneuver because they made all of the open areas way too small. To go to the bathrooms were an absolute joke.
3883,Date of experience: November 2015,23-Nov-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,3,need more bathrooms,"I went to the viking, packer game,first time at this venue.outside in the tailgating lot,there was only about 5 port a potty's with lines about an hour long,went inside and the bathroom lines were even longer. whoever designed this place never uses the bathroom. besides that everything was great."
3884,Date of experience: October 2015,17-Nov-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,SKOL Vikings!,"One last chance in life to see an outdoor, Vikings home game and it was worth the trip from Florida to do it."
3885,Date of experience: September 2015,15-Nov-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Great outdoor venue for big time games.,"The venue is great but every game I've seen there, football or soccer, the field is awful for traction and ball bounce. It's been a few years but I don't think they plan to fix it."
3886,Date of experience: October 2015,11-Nov-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Best stadium ever!,"We three attended the Michigan-Minnesota college football game. The seats were comfortable, the ladies' rooms were clean, and the screens always had something on ( kiss cam, cute kids, get to know the players). The Minnesota band worked non-stop all night. Goldie the gopher changed costumes 6-8 times. Really fun!This was the nicest venue that I have visited."
3887,Date of experience: November 2015,9-Nov-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,3,"Good facility, logistics confusion.","If taking the rail after the stadium, do yourself a favor and go to the next stop towards Minneapolis and get on there. The time you spending walking will be less than standing in line at Stadium Village. The facility itself is nice, but small. It's easy to find your way around. Services are conveniently located. It's a very fun outdoor stadium."
3888,Date of experience: October 2015,26-Oct-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Vikings vs. Chiefs Game,"The ability to get into the game was the only down-side.  Took WAY too long for us to get through the line.  However, once inside the stadium it was very nice for a college team.  Reminded me of some of the older Pro stadiums.  Wide concourse, access to restrooms and food was good.  We were easily able to ride the Light-Rail to and from the game back to our hotel downtown."
3889,Date of experience: October 2015,25-Oct-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Great College Venue,"I attended a Minnesota Gopher football game there,and found this stadium to be top notch in almost every regard.  I had end zone seats, but never felt like I was missing anything.  The stadium's size allows more intimacy and a feeling of participation in the spectacle on the field.  I loved the student participation during the game, and the ""kiss cam"", ""baby cam"" and other clever uses of the big screen was terrific."
3890,Date of experience: October 2015,22-Oct-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Cool Stadium,Not as large as other big 10 stadiums but you get a mix of campus and city feel at the game. Not a bad seat in the place and a great place to watch a college football game.
3891,Date of experience: October 2015,21-Oct-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Great venue!,"We travelled to Minneapolis for the sole purpose of attending a Vikings game. We weren't sure what to expect with a college stadium but it was great. The stadium was very clean and in good condition. We sat at the 50 yard line, row 14 which were amazing seats but I don't think there was a bad seat there. U of M's band played and was very entertaining. Beer & food were pricey but that is to be expected at any event anymore. We tried fried cheese curds for the 1st time & loved them. We arrived about 2 hours before the game started and walked around the tailgating activities for a while, which were entertaining. There is a Buffalo Wild Wings right outside of the stadium with tents set up. The local sports radio station was there as well. By choice we parked about a mile & 1/2 from the stadium for $6 and enjoyed walking through the college campus. We didn't experience any traffic, there were no delays getting into the stadium, & no long lines for food or beer. The store was a little crowded but my husband picked a hat & we got out pretty quickly. The fans were colorful but never out of control. It was a nice change as we are more used to NY & Philadelphia events. All in all a great game! We can't wait to go back next season to see the new stadium."
3892,Date of experience: October 2015,19-Oct-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Not built for a NFL game,"We went for a Vikings game and it was a nightmare getting into the stadium. Other than the 45 minute wait at the gate, the stadium is really very comfortable. It seemed like there wasn't a bad seat in the house!"
3893,Date of experience: September 2015,9-Oct-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,I love this stadium!,"We went to the Gopher homecoming game against Ohio University.  What a great game and atmosphere. We dove down and parked in lot 108 where you pay ten dollars and the university buses you to the stadium. That is ten dollars per car (not person).  This is the only way to go. I love the later start times. It give you more time to tailgate before heading to the stadium.  We took our portable gas grill, table and chairs and spent a couple hours eating and socilalising. It was great. And the bus ride there is only about 10 min. And after the game the buses keep rolling one after another that you don't wait long. The lines move fast. We are going Halloween night to the Michigan game. Can't wait, go gophers!"
3894,Date of experience: October 2015,8-Oct-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,The Vikings won!,We were here for a VIkings game.  The new stadium will be finished for next season.  Good seating anywhere. Easy access.
3895,Date of experience: September 2015,7-Oct-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Up close to the Vikings,Visited this stadium to watch a Vikings game and had an amazing experience. I loved the feel of it as it wasn't too big we had a great day!
3896,Date of experience: October 2015,6-Oct-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Great Stadium!,"The stadium is great.  Right on campus at the University of Minnesota.  Easy to navigate.  Plan ahead --- at the end of your event, it can be hard to get transportation.  If using light-rail, go away from the stadium to catch a train!"
3897,Date of experience: September 2015,2-Oct-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,3,NFL- Vikings vs Chargers,The stadium was half bench seating which was very weird for a 5 year old stadium. Be careful when ordering seats so you know what type of seating you will be getting. I believe the concessions were over priced for the value you received.
3898,Date of experience: September 2015,1-Oct-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Great Stadium- poor concessions,"I went with my 12 year old to the U Homecoming game. Great game. WE took the light rail from St. Paul- get the event pass and save big and you won't wait in lines at the end of the game. It could not have been easier coming and going They did a great job with flow coming in and exiting. I thought every single thing with the structure and function went well- especially the women's bathrooms- a HUGE plus. The one and only thing that is bad, so very bad - are the concessions. I think they hired people that completely lacked in motivation. Moving slow doesn't begin to cover it. I would suggest some sort of a profit sharing program. It took greater than 30 minutes - not during any break- to get two pre made and wrapped hotdogs and a pop- 30 minutes and it wasn't half time!!!! It was a much longer time to get a beer. Someone doesn't care about increasing business!! Everything else was great- expensive but a wonderful day."
3899,Date of experience: September 2015,29-Sep-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Fun homecoming weekend,I wife and I were in town for a wedding and decided to take a trip to Dinkytown on an off day. We happen to get some tickets from scalpers and decided to see the homecoming game. It was a fantastic time. The crowd was electric and the people around us were very friendly. I highly recommend going to a game at this venue if you're in town.
3900,Date of experience: September 2015,29-Sep-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,SKOL VIKINGS SKOL!,"Watched the Vikings beat the Chargers... My first time at TCF Bank Stadium, we were in for the game visiting from Pennsylvania. Really friendly people, and a nice outdoor college atmosphere for a pro NFL game. Stadium is really nice... of course when your team wins it's always nice. Concourse full of good eats! Enjoyed the pre-game tailgate outside of the stadium... Lots to do..."
3901,Date of experience: September 2015,29-Sep-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Very nice place to see a ball game,Been there for both Gophers and Vikings games. Not a bad seat in the house. Nice wide concourses. Plenty of food options.
3902,Date of experience: September 2015,28-Sep-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,enough women bathrooms - yes!,This is a great stadium to take in a football game - lots of women's bathrooms - nice big screen to catch the instant replays too. - excited for the new Viking's stadium - but this was fun in the interim (on warm days anyways!)
3903,Date of experience: September 2015,24-Sep-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Love this stadium!,"Love this Stadium! Our son is in the University of Minnesota Marching Band. So, when we visit for Band Parent Day, we are allowed access to the parts of the stadium that many don't see. What a great venue! Very clean and very large. Stadium food is actually a little better than many of the other stadiums. Cheese curds are yummy.  Ladies bathrooms are large enough so that the lines (if any) are manageable, and unbelievably clean. Have been to other stadiums that were just disgustingly dirty.TCF is currently home to the Vikings until their new stadium is built. So the University has to share this venue at the moment. Great venue for both the University and the professional teams. Not sure, but I think it holds about 70K.Words of advice. Make sure you look up what is allowable there. Don't let backpacks in the stadium. Also, not sure how it is for Vikings games, but for U of M games all of the surrounding parking is for season ticket holders. So, your options are 1)  to park at some of the further lots, pay and walk a long distance, 2) park at those lots and take a shuttle to the stadium (they have shuttles running on game days 3) there is a street fairly close to the stadium that has meters. Find it and park there. I think it's about $4 per hour. Could be a little more, but it is convenient and fairly close."
3904,Date of experience: September 2015,17-Sep-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,"Great stadium, convenient to light rail.","I prefer to take the light rail to the game rather than find parking. The Pride of Minnesota, the University of Minnesota's band plays a short concert after the game. Rather than trying to beat the crowd, if you stay to listen to the band, the crowds will have died down. If you take the light rail, you'll avoid the frustration of sitting in traffic. A definite upgrade over the Metrodome!"
3905,Date of experience: September 2015,13-Sep-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,2,Long Lines and Minnesota Nice? Not so.,"Unfortunately the experience in TCF Bank Stadium was not up to par with other big conference stadium experiences. Very long lines to get into the stadium, get anything from concessions and of course to leave. Lines are normal at any major sporting event but somehow they were abnormally long here, and at every turn. We also looked forward to experiencing the 'Minnesota nice' and what we got was something different. After a fan attempted to yank something right out of your hands a police officer standing roughly 5 feet away chose to do nothing. Not cool."
3907,Date of experience: September 2015,6-Sep-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Nice Stadium - Loud!,"Attended TCU-U of M game on September 3, 2015. Stadium was easy to get around in and sight lines were good - even from corner visitors section. Game was sold out and stadium extremely loud. Hats off to the Gophers for making the game and TCF Bank Stadium a highlight of our trip. Only negative was traffic before and especially after the game - it was brutal."
3908,Date of experience: September 2015,4-Sep-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Fun,"Great stadium with a big concourse. Beautiful view of downtown. Fun atmosphere. Next to light rail, so easy to get there."
3909,Date of experience: September 2015,4-Sep-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,"Beautiful Stadium, Friendly People","The U of M should be very proud of the stadium. It is beautiful from the outside, easily accessible, and extremely vibrant.  It certainly gives a college/pro football game an air of excitement that offers the home team a definite home-field advantage.  Everyone who works here was very friendly as well as the public safety, etc.   give yourself a lot of time to get away from the stadium after the game as the crowds in the jammed street system cause VERY LONG delays, post event."
3910,Date of experience: December 2014,4-Sep-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Great Stadium Experience.,How can you go wrong with a visit to TCF Bank Stadium.  It's beautiful and spacious and had a great view of downtown Minneapolis.  I've only experienced football games there.
3911,Date of experience: August 2015,24-Aug-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Viking's game outside! Great stadium! Expensive though...,Went to the Vikings pre-season game this Saturday! Had a blast even with the weather evacuation (went inside and had a few beers & food). Few tips: just bring your things in a ziploc! Very strict-and only ridiculously small wallets allowed per NFL policy. Beer & food is expensive- $9/can Miller Lite! And so is parking- $20/a few blocks away.The stadium though is nice! Great views from any seat. Just good times to be had! Pre-season doesn't count for much but $25 tix were cheap to get the game experience! And was much more fun being in the outdoor stadium than the old Dome.
3912,Date of experience: August 2015,24-Aug-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Go and see the Vikings Now,"Even with the rain delay/evacuation I had a great time with the children at their Vikings game. Thought food and drink was a bit expensive, but that was expected. Concourse was big enough to house all game goers during difficult times. Better that the Dome."
3913,Date of experience: August 2015,23-Aug-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Vikings Football Game,I don't think there is a bad seat in the the stadium.   Food choices awesome!  Staff friendly!   Great beer choices!  Tweens had a blast even though our Raiders lost!
3914,Date of experience: August 2015,17-Aug-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Came for Vikes Game!,"TCF Bank is a nice stadium (though it is no Kinnick Stadium. GO Hawks!) haha! We enjoyed watching the Vikings play here, wanted to make sure to get to a game while they were playing outside at home for two seasons. This season was our last chance. Obviously it was pre-season so not packed, made for comfort. We had a good time, and enjoyed our game."
3915,Date of experience: September 2014,9-Aug-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,1,Skip This JV Stadium,"Small, often half full stadium.  There are dozens of better college game day venues than this JV stadium."
3925,Date of experience: August 2014,22-Jul-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Great views of the city!,"Great views of the city at night and the games are getting better every year with the Gophers!  Food is just ok, but the venue has lots of areas to explore. Wish the had a behind the scenes tour."
3930,Date of experience: November 2014,15-Jun-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,GO Gophers!  Rah!,"Been a season ticket holder since the stadium opened.  What's not to like about it?  Easy access in and out, parking is decent and public transit options are awesome with the light rail train depositing you right at the stadium.  Now if only we could beat Wisconsin!  Better dead than red!"
3935,Date of experience: November 2014,6-Apr-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Great Stadium to watch a game,"Good views all around. Be sure to dress warm. The new train system from St-Paul is awesome (Green Line I think?), easy and cheap. Saw Vikings vs. Redskins the day after a Wild game. Awesome weekend. Stayed at Holiday in St-Paul. Great spot!"
3937,Date of experience: September 2014,21-Mar-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Intimate Large Stadium,"I saw a Vikings game here while the new stadium is being built.  Seats were okay and it got real windy in the late afternoon.  It is not Lambeau Field, but it still cozy and friendly."
3938,Date of experience: October 2014,19-Mar-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Great stadium,"All seats offer a solid view. I have watched The Gophers, Vikings and International soccer exhibitions from various seats and was never dissapointed. Food could be better and more budget conscious."
3939,Date of experience: August 2014,15-Mar-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,There's not a bad seat in the house,"No matter where you sit in this stadium, you will still have a great view. I have been to several baseball games and tested several seats and locations in the stadium and all pass with flying colors. They have heaters in the spring and half of the stadium is always in the shade if you don't like the sun."
3940,Date of experience: October 2014,10-Mar-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Great outdoor stadium for football!,"I've only gone to Gohpers' games, but they are really fun!  We parked at the State Fair and took the bus directly to the stadium...great for tailgating and the bus doesn't take too long (10-15 min) and drops you off right at the gate!  Great little stadium for football, and they now serve beer at the U's games!  Lines get a little long, but not sure how it is for Vikings games.  Overall, love this stadium!"
3941,Date of experience: November 2014,10-Mar-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Best Stadium in BIG,"New, roomy, clean, modern bathrooms.  Tons of food choices.  BEER-WINE for sale unlike most other college stadiums.  Third largest jumbotron in nation.  Great atmosphere on UM campus.  Tailgate is a work in progress with limited parking around stadium.  Game Day is a blast, show up at least three hours early.  UM Band puts on a good show and Gopher Football is on the rise!"
3943,Date of experience: August 2014,5-Mar-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Preseason Vikings game was awesome,"Went to TCF Bank Stadium for the first time for the first Vikings preseason game against the Raiders. Loved the weather that day and being able to enjoy the game outside was wonderful. Probably had the ""worst"" seats there and we could see everything very well and had a great time. Doesn't seem like there is a bad seat in the whole place. Also the staff was very accommodating for my wife who was temporarily in wheel chair and exchanged our bleacher seats for wheelchair accessible seating. Hope to go back for the Seahawks game this year. Skol!"
3944,Date of experience: October 2014,7-Jan-15,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,A great new stadium,"I have been to TCF Bank Stadium several times and I think it is a great stadium. I sit on the North side of the stadium so that we get the sun, which helps when it is cold out. The South side of the stadium is shaded so that can be cold sometimes!"
3945,Date of experience: December 2014,31-Dec-14,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Vikings Bears Game,"We came here for the Bears Vikings game. It was a ton of fun as long as we were bundled up. Fun field, prices were bad but not half as bad as Chicago!"
3946,Date of experience: December 2014,29-Dec-14,Big Ten,Minnesota,2,Too few bathrooms to accommodate fans,"there were bathroom lines stretching the width of the concourse during half time. People couldn't get to the vendors and moving across to return to the seat was very difficult.If this will be your first time at the stadium, here is a clue for finding the right gate entrance. Minnesota county names appear alphabetically don't let that fool you. Gate B is clockwise from Gate C. Ugh we missed the opening kickoff due to this costly mistake."
3948,Date of experience: November 2014,21-Nov-14,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Nice new stadium,"went here a few weekends ago for the VIkings game. Loved the outdoor stadium. The M's club entry was hard to find and signage wasn't that great. Seats are typical plastic stadium seats of a normal width. If you have a chunky guy next to you it will be tight. Great big screen so when you exit the stadium you can still see the broadcast on the sidewalk.With the early sunset, the field is partially shaded. It was incredibly crowded at halftime in the walk ways and nearly impossible to move. If we didn't have the M club it would have been miserable trying to get food. THe M club made the day for us."
3949,Date of experience: October 2014,21-Oct-14,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Fantastic!!!,"A really nice stadium and a great place to see a game!  Sitting on the home side is a bit chilly in the shade, but so much FUN!Go Gophers!"
3950,Date of experience: October 2014,20-Oct-14,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,So much better than the Metrodome.,"I love the Metrodome as much as the next guy for it's history and the memories I have made there but I saw my first outdoor NFL game at TCF for Vikings vs. Lions. Although the Vikings never showed up to play football, the stadiums is awesome. We were front row 50 yard line on the Vikings side and it was the best game experience of my life. The beer guys were great and going to the bathroom didn't take all of halftime like it did in the dome. I recommend it!"
3951,Date of experience: September 2014,4-Oct-14,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Worth a look,I just saw the Vikings v. Atlanta game there with friends and we sat in the end zone.  I have been to multiple Minnesota Gophers college games there usually with phenomenal seats.  My conclusion after sitting in the end zone is that there are no bad seats in the house.  This is a wonderful stadium and it would be worth taking a look even if there is no game.  I also think that it is really cool that all of the counties in the state are listed on the outside as you walk around.
3954,Date of experience: September 2014,22-Sep-14,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Great College Stadium.  Take the train and save $,"The green line runs very close to the stadium, so I rode from the Mall of America area for $3.50 on a 6 hour pass.  Very thrifty transportation, though it did take a while to get there.  Nice to have covered areas in the stadium as we were there when they had a rain delay for 63 minutes.  Would have been nice if they had better communicated the situation as they tried to clear the stadium and then restart the game.  Also the train from the west runs past the Union and many eateries along University Ave, so easy to get off early, grab a bit to eat and then walk over to the stadium.  If that was helpful, please give me a vote."
3956,Date of experience: September 2014,21-Sep-14,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Very nice facility,"Relatively new, currently being used by both Univ of Mn and Mn Vikings games.  Beautiful field - cost us taxpayers a lot of $.  Strongly recommend taking light rail as parking in area is very expensive."
3957,Date of experience: September 2014,18-Sep-14,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Vikings v. Pats,"Great venue, easy to get to on Metro (LRT), comfortable seating and lots or room in corridors.  Sat on upper sideline providing great views of game.  Get to game early for tailgaiting all around stadium, including at Buffalo Wild Wings."
3958,Date of experience: September 2014,17-Sep-14,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Great place to see a game!,Visited last weekend for the Pats vs Vikings game. Had row 2 seats...so the view was amazing...although all seats looked like they were awesome! The good.....womens room lines were non existant....which I have never seen! The mens room had a huge line. The bad....the lines for food/drinks other than Miller lite were horrendous! 40 minutes for 2 Redds Apple Ales! They need to start selling different alcohol in the stands and in the little beer carts to alleviate the long lines. it did not help that the workers were the slowest people I have ever seen behind a counter. Just be mindful of this when you go...I went up at 1120 to get a drink and almost missed kick off!
3959,Date of experience: September 2014,17-Sep-14,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,A little small for NFL games,Liked that it was easy to get to but there are no seat numbers on the concourse so it can be tough to figure out which entrance to go into.
3960,Date of experience: September 2014,16-Sep-14,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Great Football Venue,"We went for Vikings vs Patriots last weekend and really enjoyed the layout.  It was nice to be ""on top"" of the field."
3961,Date of experience: September 2014,16-Sep-14,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Wow!,This is a great place to watch the Vikings. Not a bad seat in the house. Hoping o make it to a few more games...outdoors! <3
3962,Date of experience: September 2014,2-Sep-14,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Go Gophers!,"Always a fun time at the Bank. Great site lines, prompt service at counters. Reasonable pricing for events. Fun time with family / friends!"
3963,Date of experience: August 2014,2-Sep-14,Big Ten,Minnesota,3,OK at best,"Just another stadium. Probably great for a U of M game but lacking for the Vikings, no backs on seats. Hard to park, light rail full. Only game in town if you want to see the Vikings, I would watch on TV instead."
3964,Date of experience: August 2014,29-Aug-14,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,"Big, beautiful and modern","This stadium is very esthetically appealing.  I like the huge M laid down on the bleachers.  It is right next to the university, which is convenient."
3965,Date of experience: August 2014,22-Aug-14,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Skoal Vikes!,"We went to see the pre-season game last Saturday.  We got cheap tickets online at the last minute and they ended up being in the second row from the top.  One would think this would have been terrible seats however I don't really think there are bad seats in this stadium.  It was easy to find our seats, easy to access snacks at the numerous windows and there was no long line for the bathrooms.  The stadium was amazingly clean and well-run.  We had no problem parking at Northrup ($20) and it's a pleasant walk to the stadium down Frat Row.  Really enjoyed the evening!  Go Vikes!"
3966,Date of experience: August 2014,19-Aug-14,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,SKOL Vikings,"First outdoor Viking game, cant wait until the new stadium, loved not having to pee in a trough like the metrodome, lots of room. Verizon Service sucked at the time of the game, but understandable when u have 50,000+fans trying to access the network"
3967,Date of experience: August 2014,11-Aug-14,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Fun football experience,"I recently attended a Vikings pre-season game at TCF Bank Stadium. Overall the experience was very good; the venue itself is designed very well with a large open air concourse, numerous concessionaires and restrooms. I never once felt too crowded or had to wait in line for more than a couple minutes. Our seats were on the 30 yard line in the lower deck and the view was phenomenal. The seats were fairly comfortable (though a bit narrow). The seats near the end zones appear to be benches as well. As far as enjoying football outdoors, TCF Stadium was as good of experience as I could have hoped for. I did find that the venue lacked a little bit of ""energy"" that seems to be present with indoor venues (metrodome, xcel energy center), but being able to enjoy a beautiful summer evening was worth it."
3968,Date of experience: August 2014,10-Aug-14,Big Ten,Minnesota,3,Good stadium but...,"Parking is impossible and expensive, security is fast but don't bother having a bag. I think there is too much beer (way too much) and no police at the exit to make sure some are ok to drive - I saw many who were not. Smoking ban in the campus, not smart we saw many sneaking - it would be better to have a smoking spot instead of multiple illegal ones.Nice stadium though."
3970,Date of experience: August 2014,8-Aug-14,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Had a great time watching Raiders V Vikings!,Security staff was incredibly courteous and helpful. Views were amazing. Seemed a little crowded and it wasn't that full. Large screen was toward west and for our evening game the sun made it difficult to look for more than a few seconds.
3971,Date of experience: August 2014,7-Aug-14,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Great place to watch a sporting event,"We attended a Guinness International Champions Cup semi-final soccer game at TCF Bank Stadium. Every seat in the place has great sight-lines. Many of the seats have backs on them and are surprisingly comfortable. The people who work at the stadium are friendly and helpful. The light rail green line stops just outside the stadium (Stadium Village stop). I was highly impressed. Why a four-star ""very good"" rating then? The food is terrible! We couldn't find one semi-healthy or unusual food item--not even pizza for this event. I'm told that during the football season you can get pre-made Subway sandwiches and pizza by the slice. But come on! Most stadiums are doing much better than that these days (Target Field, for example). I suggest arriving early, eating at one of the establishments in Stadium Village, and choosing beverages at the Bank."
3976,Date of experience: September 2013,2-Jul-14,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Great venue!,"I have attended a few Gopher games now and each time has been great fun.  Wonderful stadium that has big feel atmoshpere packed into a small stadium.  No bad seat in the house and plenty of food choices.  Jumbo screen allows you to view replays and action easily.  Great to have football on the university campus, where it belongs.  Near Stadium Village offering places to eat and drink, carry out available at great liquor store just a few blocks away!"
3983,Date of experience: October 2013,12-Dec-13,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Awesome stadium experience,"I have been to over a dozen Gopher footbal games and each one has been a great experience whether we win or lose. It's very spacious, the seats are comfortable and the bathrooms are large and clean. I'm also very happy that they now sell alcohol."
3984,Date of experience: November 2013,2-Dec-13,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Best ballpark,"Tremendous site-lines, incredible youthful atmosphere. And the best concessions I have ever seen. Despite a losing team, plenty of fun and smiles."
3985,Date of experience: November 2013,1-Dec-13,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,One of the best new stadiums in college football,"I've seen  several games here.  It's just a great stadium to see college football.  It seats about 50,000 (standing room) and their is not a bad seat in the house."
3986,Date of experience: September 2013,1-Dec-13,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Well Designed Football Venue,"TCF Bank Stadium is a welcome change from the Metrodome for U of M football. We attended the Gophers-Iowa game in September, on a cool, wet afternoon. Although the weather was not wonderful, the atmosphere was. Being outdoors brings out the spriit of those attending. Our seats were on about the 10 yard line and fairly high up, but still with great views of the action. Love the spacious concourses and their basic design that brings back memories of Memorial Stadium."
3987,Date of experience: November 2013,25-Nov-13,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,It's not all about the football game,"I'm not a great fan of football, but I love going to the TCF Bank Stadium.  It has good food, a great campus location, and the U of MN marching band is worth the price of admission."
3989,Date of experience: October 2013,26-Oct-13,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Great Fans,We were not rooting for the Gophers but the fans could not have been nicer.  Great stadium and fun experience.
3990,Date of experience: September 2013,20-Oct-13,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Go Vikings,had lots of fun at our first ever NFL game.  The fans were amazing and the atmosphere was lots of fun.
3991,Date of experience: September 2013,14-Oct-13,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Big Ten Football,"Minnesota Gopher fans can be proud of its new football stadium. The perfectly bowl shaped stadium accommodates excellent views from all seats. Now that the sale of beer has been approved, TCF Stadium can be considered the best place to watch a Big Ten Football game, and soon to be the temporary venue for the Minnesota Vikings."
3992,Date of experience: November 2012,11-Oct-13,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Father daughter night.,"Love love the stadium.  It was cold this evening, but hot cocoa or coffee was readily availbe.  Now only if we can get the gophers to win a few more games."
3994,Date of experience: September 2013,2-Oct-13,Big Ten,Minnesota,2,Great Stadium but some common sense please.,"I recently went to a game and thought the stadium was great. The band was great and the atmosphere was terrific as well.  My issue came when we went to buy a beer. The lady at the beer vendor asked for ID from us as they do with everyone. I had no issue with this. I presented my Manitoba issued drivers license which showed that I'm 42 years old, only to be told that a Canadian drivers license wasn't an acceptable form of ID, only American licences were.  Canadians need a passport to buy beer. I actually thought I was being punked. I asked why my drivers licence wasn't acceptable and was rudely told that ""you need a passport to get into the country"".  I tried to explain that I wasn't trying to enter the country, but just trying to buy a beer. My argument fell on deaf ears and we ended up getting a guy we met at our seats to purchase a beer for us. It was one of the most ridiculous experiences of my life. For a university, they sure didn't seem very intelligent."
3995,Date of experience: September 2013,22-Sep-13,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Beautiful stadium,Attended a Minnesota Gophers football game at this stadium. It is a beautiful stadium that is well laid out and well staffed. There does not appear to be a bad seat in the house. Good food and beverage options. Many hotel and restaurant options are available nearby.
3996,Date of experience: September 2013,22-Sep-13,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Great university stadium,Went to a gopher game there and loved it. Such a great stadium and love the design and the unique feeling it has. Great food choice too.
3997,Date of experience: September 2013,21-Sep-13,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Beautiful new stadium,"Great layout for this new stadium. All seats are good, the inside of the stadium is well organized with ample restrooms and vendors at every gate. Good tv screens to watch the game up close. Very pleasing stadium to watch a Gophers game."
4000,Date of experience: September 2012,29-Jul-13,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Good place to watch a Gophers game.,Lots of parking around the area and the stadium has plenty of vendors and space to walk along with the seats having a little wiggle room as well. Worth your time to check out a game!
4001,Date of experience: September 2012,2-Jul-13,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Back on campus,"I love that Gopher football is back on campus. The atmosphere of football games is so much better compared to the Dome. The view is amazing!If you drive, I recommend parking on the West Bank and taking a shuttle to and from the stadium; it makes arriving and leaving a lot easier. Go Gophers!"
4002,Date of experience: November 2012,14-Jun-13,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Fun atmosphere even in the cold,Attended the last home game of the year where the temp at gametime was 29 degrees F.  This is a great stadium for football with wonderful sightlines and excellent video screens to see the replays of the great plays (sadly on this day they were few and far between).I ha dpreviously attended a game in early Fall where the temp was 70+ and the crowd was much larger.Each time though the people there genuinely seemed to be enjoying the mselves.
4004,Date of experience: October 2012,6-May-13,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Love to Watch the Gophers,My son has season tickets for  Gopher football and he takes me whenever our team is not playing at the same time.  The sight lines are great the atmosphere exciting and with Coach Kill the Gophers are getting better.  As a coach and my son as an alumni football players appreciate all the amenities for the team and coaches.
4005,Date of experience: November 2012,26-Apr-13,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Open air on campus,"I went to the UofM from 2004-2008 so I saw most Gopher games at the Metrodome. So when I went to see a game at TCF bank stadium, I was really impressed and excited for the many students that will get to watch their team play so close to campus and in the open air. Now Mpls might get a little chilly for most (if not all) of the games, but I think it is worth it! We walked around a lot to test out the many different views of the field, and I couldn't find a bad seat in the stadium. I will definitely be back and hopefully the gophers will win that time!"
4006,Date of experience: November 2012,5-Apr-13,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Great place for a game,"I really like the new stadium, but as a late twenty something I would prefer that there were adult beverages available while watching a cold outdoor game. Last year they did try selling beer and wine, but it was only on one side of the field, and lines were gruesome. With some work this could be ironed out, and the park would be a gem. Bring your hat and mittens, it gets pretty cold!"
4007,Date of experience: October 2012,31-Mar-13,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Great place to watch a football game,"Love this stadium, game was a blast!  Feel close to the game and loved the atmosphere.  Not a lot of food choices"
4009,Date of experience: August 2012,15-Mar-13,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Go Vikings :),"We enjoyed this place during the pre-season game of Vikings. For out non-Americans, the football is a kind of new experience. But enjoyable. Expensive though."
4010,Date of experience: November 2012,10-Mar-13,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Great stadium!,"I may be a bit biased, since I played in the marching band for the Golden Gophers, but I absolutely LOVE TCF bank stadium.  I have been to almost every game since it opened. There is a good view from every seat, and inside they have rehearsal rooms, high tech classrooms, and the home of the Gopher football team, including an incredible locker room for the team."
4011,Date of experience: August 2012,26-Feb-13,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,senior reviewer,"It is a beautiful stadium, the seating is not bad, the city view is spectacular.  So nice to be outside for the games, just wish the TWINS would have done better :("
4012,Date of experience: October 2012,15-Feb-13,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Very nice college football stadium,This stadium was built just a handful of years ago and is a nice venue for enjoying an outdoor college football game.  I recommend parking at the state fairgrounds and taking the free bus over to the stadium.
4014,Date of experience: October 2012,13-Jan-13,Big Ten,Minnesota,3,"Parking horrible, home side not equal to visitor side",Why on earth would you build a stadium that is a nightmare to get to and the parking is horrible? Perhaps someone thought students would attend games - which they DON'T for the most part. Plus the visitor seating and concessions are inferior to the home side. I don't get it. The food is horrible and controlled by the university who is not passionate about food at all. I am very disappointed in this stadium. Was excited to see it go up and enjoy the concept.
4016,Date of experience: September 2012,29-Dec-12,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Win or lose...it's a great venue!,"True...this isn't Michigan Stadium (my personal favorite) but it's a significant upgrade from the Metrodome. Go early and enjoy the U of M band playing on Oak St between TCF and Mariucci Arena.Concourses are huge and restrooms plentiful. Please ignore the embarrassing banners for the MicronPC.com bowl that we proudly hang around the top of the stadium's upper level.Small by Big Ten standards (capacity about 50K), ""The Bank"" will soon become the temporary home for the Vikings (2014, 2015, 2016?) while the dome is condemned and the new stadium is built."
4017,Date of experience: November 2012,26-Dec-12,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Awesome Stadium!!!,"We have been season ticket holders for Gopher Football for a few years now and I love the stadium!  (So much better than the Metrodome!)  The first year the stadium was open was my last year as a member of the U of M Marching Band.  It was incredible being on the field each week, and still as a spectator the stadium is great!  The inner parts of the stadium (concourse, bathrooms, etc) are pretty stripped and simple but just being in the stadium, seeing the Minneapolis Skyline is what really makes the experience.  It is a bit cold in the winter, but that's what you get with an open stadium in Minnesota."
4018,Date of experience: September 2012,20-Nov-12,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Great stadium,The U of M did a nice job on the stadium when they moved back to the campus.  I've been to a number of games at TCF and always enjoy the comfortable seats at good prices.  Concessions are pricey but that's sports.
4019,Date of experience: November 2012,5-Nov-12,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Minn vs Michigan football,TCF Bank Stadium is a beautiful facility with lots of leg room and great sight lines.  The only Big Ten college stadium that serves beer. With some of the nicest fans in NCAA football.
4020,Date of experience: October 2012,5-Nov-12,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Check it out!!,This place is for real! Check it out and enjoy the food and the great sight lines in the stadium. Not a bad seat in the house and get there early for some unbelievable tailgating opportunities in the best part of Minneapolis!
4021,Date of experience: September 2012,5-Oct-12,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Fun,Is a beautiful new stadium right on campus. Only thing is they don't serve alcohol there ( but as of 2013 they will start) and there was nowhere to smoke.
4022,Date of experience: September 2012,24-Sep-12,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Good sight lines and amenities!,"We had seats 11 rows up in the upper level of the end zone and it felt like we were close to game.  Decent food options (subway, hot dogs, mini donuts etc.) along with various beverages (hot & cold)."
4023,Date of experience: September 2012,24-Sep-12,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,"The ""Bank"" Rocks!",TCF Bank Stadium is a great facility for football.  The atmosphere is awesome when the crowd is rocking.  Very family friendly and easy to get to.  $10 per car parking offered at various lots with a quick shuttle bus to the stadium.  Spent the last 2 Saturdays there and it was awesome!  A must see for an outside football experience!
4026,Date of experience: October 2011,10-Sep-12,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Great place to watch football!!,"TCF may not be the giant stadium or bastion of college football history that the big house in Michigan or Memorial Stadium in Lincoln are, but it is a great place to see a game. The stands are incredibly close to the action and you can see the downtown Minneapolis skyline from most seats."
4030,Date of experience: October 2011,1-Aug-12,Big Ten,Minnesota,2,Porr management,"the U of M  can't get anything right.   Many of the entrances were understaffed,  The land grant university  continues to suck  as much money from the populace  as they can without  providing  services to customers.    Great  stadium, poor management.  Once again the State has failed when given a great opportunity  to have a pleasing experience."
4032,Date of experience: September 2011,17-Jul-12,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,If you like college football this is the place for you,"I'm a Hawkeye fan and a fan of college football.  Go to a game and listen to the band, have a hot dog and appreciate the exterior of the stadium and how it has all of the counties of the state listed.  I get goosebumps thinking about it though I still would like to see whomever is playing the fers to win."
4033,Date of experience: November 2011,13-Jul-12,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,a fun place,"I liked the whole thing; it is well laid out, easy sight lines and gives the appearance of the old fashion football stadia."
4035,Date of experience: October 2011,29-Jun-12,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,wonderful,it took many years for the U to finally have a new stadium and it is state of the arts.  No alcohol allowed except for the big shots.  I loved the old stadium  it really had alot of character and memories  too bad it had to go.
4036,Date of experience: September 2011,22-Jun-12,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Football Outdoors as it Should Be!,A very nice stadium to watch college football.  Good seats.  Nice facility all the way around.
4037,Date of experience: November 2011,16-Jun-12,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Best College Football Stadium,The new TCF stadium has wonderful sightlines and is best enjoyed during a University of MN football game.  Bring warm clothes and be prepared to cheer.
4038,Date of experience: September 2011,12-Jun-12,Big Ten,Minnesota,4,Go Gophers!,"Clean & modern, good view from everywhere.  Only improvement will be serving beer."
4043,Date of experience: November 2011,29-Jan-12,Big Ten,Minnesota,5,Fantastic Campus Stadium,TCF Bank Stadium (sometimes called The Bank) opened in 2009 and is the University of Minnesota??s on Campus football stadium. It is a beautiful horseshoe shaped stadium near the site of the old Memorial Stadium.  The seats are relatively close to the field so you are close to the action and have great views.   When you look out the open end of the horseshoe you get a great view of downtown Minneapolis. Also on the open end is one of the biggest college scoreboards in the county.   I believe it is the 3rd biggest scoreboard in the country ?? it??s great for watching replays.   The only negative (if you are a beer drinker) is that you cannot buy alcohol in any part of the stadium (including the expensive executive boxes).Overall I love watching football in this stadium. I have only missed a few games since it opened up.
4057,Date of experience: October 2022,3-Oct-22,Big Ten,Nebraska,1,Terrible seats,"First time goi ng to a Nebraska game and was beyond excited. Spent 550 dollars on two tickets, 50 yard line row42.  The view on vivid seats looked awesome.  Instead  our seats were directly behind a pillar under the roof.  Why would a venue sell tickets directly behind a pillar??? Ruined the entire experience and what made it even worse was the seats were so crammed together it felt like you were sitting on the next person.  I loved tailgate experience at the rail yard and other places downtown. The stadium sucked and shame on you Nebraska for selling tickets like this.  The guy in front of me had a seat with his face pretty much touching the pillar allGame."
4058,Date of experience: September 2022,17-Sep-22,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,"Even when we don't win, this is a great experience","Always a great time, before and after, sometimes the games are hard to work.  However a wonderful experience with my family everytime."
4059,Date of experience: September 2022,5-Sep-22,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,No place like Nebraska,Football here sold out since October 1962.  There is no place like Nebraska for football- fans support their team at home and on the road
4060,Date of experience: November 2021,14-Nov-21,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Game day,"I love the attitude at the stadium. Everyone is so proud of their Nebraska Cornhusker Football! They keep the crowd involved in the game especially when we get a touchdown. The red balloons float into the sky with the first touchdown. The crowd chants for the Husker team. We sat in club seating. It was so much more comfortable than the regular bleacher seats. We had a stadium seat to sit in. We could go inside to get food, use the restroom and stay out of the sun."
4061,Date of experience: October 2021,7-Nov-21,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,First timer and a True Huskers Football Fan!!,"I went with my friend for her birthday. Her family has had seats for over 50 years! We arrived in the Market area about 9:30 A.M. the game starts at 2:30 P.M. on a beautiful 60 degree sunny fall day!! Wow! I couldn??t believe how this city takes on a whole community environment!! We walked all over and getting into the stadium and getting to our seats was easy!! Everyone was helpful and well organized!! Over 90,000 people inside!! Wow! Everyone singing the National Anthem! The 5 parachute jumpers from the 5 military branches!!! It brought tears of pride to our eyes!! I am sure we weren??t the only ones!! Fun! If only Nebraska could have won!! I will be back again!"
4062,Date of experience: October 2021,3-Nov-21,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,First college football game in 36 years!,"While traveling on business, decided to attend Purdue vs. Nebraska. My first college football game since the mid-1980s. The stadium was easy to access from multiple parking lots. Great tailgate scene, and an easy walk to downtown Lincoln. Sun can be bright in the north end zone. Fantastic game day atmosphere."
4063,Date of experience: October 2021,12-Oct-21,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,Fun away stadium to see your team,Great atmosphere for a college football game. Friendly people. Bit of a maze depending where your seats are to get to them. I had plenty of room at my seat. GO BLUE!!
4064,Date of experience: December 2019,22-Nov-20,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Go Huskers!!!,"Such an Amazing Environment! Nebraskans really love Huskers and you start to love the team too! Beautiful stadium, amazing supporters, and indescribable experience at College Football! Go Big Red!"

4069,Date of experience: October 2019,5-Mar-20,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Awesome Venue,"Anyone visiting Lincoln, Nebr. should definitely visit Memorial Stadium or attend 1 game in their lifetime!"
4071,Date of experience: November 2019,19-Nov-19,Big Ten,Nebraska,3,Seat very narrow,"Nebraska mus think ever human is skinny.  The seats are so small you eventually feel like you are sitting on your neighbors lap.  They provide seat cusions for $5 donation, you put several of them in a row and you will overlap someone else's seat. Atmosphere was abosulutely amazining.  You want tickets on the East side of the stadium or lower level of the west side.  We were row 44 and had obstructive view of the game.  Plus, they don't indicate on the tickets that the seats are obstructed."
4072,Date of experience: November 2019,18-Nov-19,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,best fan base around,I went for the first time to a football game at memorial stadium and I was wearing gear for the visiting team. I expected to get heckled but it was the opposite....I was greeted by the event staff with welcome thanks for coming and good luck. Every where I went there was some one that worked there making sure that I new were to go. My team one and on the way out all the home fans were congratulating me on how my team did. I been to many other venues and NEVER have i been treated so good .....I will be coming back for sure Awesome place to watch a football game!!!
4073,Date of experience: November 2019,6-Nov-19,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,"Great Ambience! ""Cheap"" seats too cramped!","Nebraska Football, you either are into it or not. It can be extremely exciting, but is also very crowded."

4075,Date of experience: October 2019,31-Oct-19,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Every seat is a winner,"The stadium holds nearly 100,000 but every seat has a great view and you feel close to the action everywhere. The parking is efficient and travel to the stadium flows well for the number of people involved."
4076,Date of experience: October 2019,27-Oct-19,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Record setting stadium!,"We were at the Huskers game v Indiana and although it was a loss the stadium is great. Very reasonable prices for all the sodas, sandwiches and other food treats. There are great views of the large screens from everywhere in the stadium. The attendants are helpful and a seat back can be rented for 5.00$??- very reasonable. Parking for 25.00 was available within a few blocks for the stadium. Great place!"
4077,Date of experience: October 2019,9-Oct-19,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,GREAT CROWD,"Just went to the Northwestern Game and the crowd and ambiance was up to par. We had a great time. Of course food and drinks are over priced, but it's part of the entertainment value i suppose. GBR!"
4078,Date of experience: October 2019,9-Oct-19,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,The place to be 7 Saturdays each fall,"This is the third largest ??city?? in the State of Nebraska.  A typical old stadium with step stairs, few toilets, poor while expensive parking, but the greatest place to see and feel a college football game.  It??s the home of the best fans in the country in welcoming opponents. Win or loose it is always a great experience."
4079,Date of experience: October 2019,8-Oct-19,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,The sea of Red!,"Memorial Stadium in Lincoln, Nebraska is a great place to watch a football game! The fans love their Huskers, win or lose. The fans are constantly involved in the game and participate in the many cheers. The stadium has first class tv screens and a state of the art sound system. You will stay updated with other scores from around the country.The fans stand at the end of the game and applaud their Huskers, win or lose. As the opposing team leaves the field, the fans again stand and salute them whether they beat their Huskers or not. A true class act, I couldn't be prouder! I've been to several stadiums, there truly is no place like Nebraska!I would have given this a 5-star if it weren't for the bench seating with about 18"" per seat. They are increasing the width of some of the seats but its time to nix the bench seats and install stadium seating. If the row is full, you will be squished, at least with the 18"" seats. All in all, its a great time and I highly recommend a visit. Bring kids, young and old, friends or go alone, you'll make friends while you're there. GBR!"
4080,Date of experience: October 2019,8-Oct-19,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,GBR!,As always a great experience at memorial stadium. Friendly fans and super helpful staff. And a win!!

4082,Date of experience: October 2019,7-Oct-19,Big Ten,Nebraska,2,"Fun game, stadium not so much","Seats so uncomfortable we had to leave! Couldn't find cotton candy anywhere even though we smelt it. They had like 12-13 year olds doing hard labor. Selling the food and drinks in the sections. It was difficult to walk up those steps, I couldn't imagine a small kid doing it carrying heavy food or drink containers. One was casting a container FULL of 20 oz cokes! By full I mean like 16 bottles or so. That's not right."
4083,Date of experience: October 2019,6-Oct-19,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Go Cornhuskers!,"Came to a game to watch a family member who plays for the team. The stadium is SUPER nice and HUGE! Only thing I can say is, better parking options. The walk that I had to do was a bit tiresome in the heat."
4084,Date of experience: September 2019,30-Sep-19,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Awesome Experience,Great game day environment! We got to be there for college game day and had an incredible time at the stadium and the local bars/restaurants.
4085,Date of experience: September 2019,30-Sep-19,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Hallowed Ground,"I firmly believe Memorial Stadium is hollowed ground for college football fans and is an experience no fan of the game should miss in their lifetime. Take a walk down the mall. Stop at the bronze in front of the east entrance. See the words on the facade, ??Through these gates pass the greatest fans in college football.?? And ??Not the victory, but the action; Not the goal, but the game; In the deed, the glory!??Enter and see the displays of great players in the concourse. Walk into the Sea of Red in the stands and meet the friendly and sportsmanlike fans of Nebraska. You won??t find more passionate yet welcoming folks anywhere. Watch the team enter to the Tunnel Walk. They play for Nebraska! The band pounds out the March Glorioso and Hail Varsity! And now you can finally watch a great football game.I have taken many friends from other schools to games at Memorial Stadium, and all agree it was an experience they will never forget."
4086,Date of experience: September 2019,29-Sep-19,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,College game day,"Have always wanted to catch a corn husker game and found myself in town on a prime weekend...nebraska vs ohio state.Parking around campus limited even 2 hours before the game. Parked on 12th and N for $20.Walked through the beautiful campus to arrive at the main entrance. What a beautiful structure. Walking to our seats ( section 103, row 12...were excellent seats) you get a sense of the age with old narrow staircases.Inside the bathrooms were cleaned and they had sufficient food/drink stations for 90,000 people.Atmosphere for the game was great and we enjoyed the experience and our seats.A great place to watch college football with friendly fans."
4087,Date of experience: September 2019,29-Sep-19,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,"Crowded, but friendly",Absolutely friendliest sports venue I??ve ever visited. Great views from all seats. Staff very helpful. Fans gracious.
4088,Date of experience: September 2019,29-Sep-19,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Cool Stadium.  Great People!,"We had a blast tailgating in the Haymarket area for about 6 hours prior to kickoff.  Nebraska fans were friendly, inviting and generous. The area is a great setup within a mile of the football, baseball, softball, basketball and hockey venues."
4090,Date of experience: August 2019,3-Sep-19,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,GO BIG RED,"If you are a college football fan seeing a game in this stadium is a must. Arrive before kick off to see the tunnel walk as the players enter the field. Nebraska fans are the nicest fans ever. They are quick to acknowledge the visitors and cheer for them even if the home team loses the game. Sold out for over 50 years but you can find seats on 3rd party web sites. They are more tickets for the non conference games at close to fave values. Almost 90,000 fans at every game. Spent 5 bucks to rent a seaf with a back that makes it more comfortable."

The experience as a whole is something every college football fan should experience. Fans are welcoming to opponents fans and very knowledgeable of the game. You can feel the tradition when you enter the stadium. The entire downtown area around campus is buzzing several hours before kickoff. Great experience!"
4096,Date of experience: October 2018,3-Jul-19,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Go big red!!,"Words cannot properly describe the game day atmosphere of Nebraska football! From the tunnel walk to 90,000 fans cheering the Cornhuskers to victory it is a definitely unlike any other experience"
4100,Date of experience: October 2018,2-Jul-19,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,football's greatest site,"not from this state but if your visiting and its on a football saturday, go to a game. anygame. walk outside and you can scaple a ticket from someone for reasonable. do it in the parking lots to avoid professionals. if all you need is one or two, someone will have stuck their spouse. the building is historic. the enviornment during a game is unmatched. I know. I have gone to games in dozens of other states over the years since i am not a born Nebraskan. They know how to do it here. Make it happen for any football fan."
4101,Date of experience: September 2018,21-Jun-19,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,"Great Stadium, Even Better Experience","Like most other big ten schools, football Saturdays in Lincoln are filled with energy and excitement. Home of the Nebraska football program, this large football stadium is a must see for anyone stopping in during the season. Located on campus, Memorial Stadium attracts thousands of fans and tailgaters waiting to watch the hometown team compete. Even if football isn??t your thing, nothing compares to the incredible atmosphere awaiting you inside. Concessions prices are modest and restrooms are easy to locate. As far as expenses go, ticket prices are on the expensive side, since every game is a sellout. The only other negatives are parking (free parking is off campus, pay for closer access), crowds waiting to seat (section entrances get crowded, recommend showing up at least 30 mins early), and a no alcohol policy. Overall, nothing beats a day at Memorial Stadium with thousands of fans cheering on a team with rich history and excitement.Ratings (1 to 10)Location - 8Parking - 6Atmosphere - 10Value - 7Amenities - 7"
4104,Date of experience: September 2018,9-Jun-19,Big Ten,Nebraska,2,Overrated,"I've been inside the stadium a few times. If you were born here (thankfully, I wasn't) this has got to be the cat's meow for you.  If you're into college football, I would say its not quite as nice as California facilities, but worth seeing because of the history.  They have had 5 national championships.  Unfortunately, big egos, foolish firings and nepotism killed the great momentum they had around the early 2000's, and I don't see anyone bringing much attention to it here.  Now that Nebraska is in the Big 10, they finally realize what other teams dealt with for the previous 30 years--tough opponents each weekend instead of easy ones most of the time and less than a half-dozen that could really give a game.  Time to grow up, Huskers.  If anyone other than an ex-Husker had started last season 0-6, nothing would have saved their job."
4107,Date of experience: November 2018,4-Jun-19,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Football game,Love tailgating and going to the football game here in Nebraska. Been to several football stadiums but Nebraska has the nicest fans. Fans love to tailgate with any college team.

Every game since September 1962 has been a sellout, with capacity now around 88,000.The fans are friendly, the stadium is a few blocks north of downtown, so there is plenty to do before and after the game.  Tailgate parties abound and even if you are from the visiting team, you will enjoy the atmosphere and experience.GO BIG RED!!!"

You do not have to be a Nebraska fan to enjoy the experience which I know from the personal experience with numerous visitors from across the U.S. and several other countries who have enjoyed the time they got to spend at Memorial Stadium. Several people, who I would not count as sports fanatics, requested an opportunity to include a visit to Memorial Stadium while they were visiting Lincoln."

Unfortunately, the older areas of the stadium, where we were seating, don't allow for much seat or leg room. All in all, a great college game day experience . Just plan on it not being a very comfortable experience!"
4132,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Oct-18,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,NEBRASKA FOOTBALL GAME #GBR,Attending a game at Memorial stadium to watch the Cornhuskers is like no other. There is a reason they have sold out every home game since 1962. Despite them losing the atmosphere and crowd were second to none. I would highly recommend any football fan to try and go to a University of Nebraska football game. You won't be disappointed.

4139,Date of experience: September 2018,4-Sep-18,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Great Environment,As a visiting team one never knows what to expect. The stadium is well maintained and offers a lot of options. NE fans were great and went out of their way to welcome us to Lincoln.
4140,Date of experience: September 2018,3-Sep-18,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,What a family show that Football Team put on in a historical stadium.....,"The Stadium if iconic and has some very good history in it. Be aware, the seats are really small using the optional chairs with the backs because of the stadium seating bleachers. Remember, they're packing roughly 85,000 in there every game......"
4141,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Sep-18,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,Iconic Cathedral of College Football,"If you are a true fan of college football, and not just the Huskers, you need to experience a game here at least once in your lifetime. There are few if any venues in the country that can match the experience. This is a historic stadium with some nice updates. The game day experience is not to be missed. A sea of red clad classy and welcoming Husker fans will greet you. There are terrific high def video screens and a recently upgraded sound system.  This place misses 5 stars primarily of some tight bleacher seating, especially in the end zones."
4142,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Sep-18,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,It is the greatest place in the world.,"It is the greatest place in the world. The greatest sporting event in the world happens there 6-7 times per year. If I were nit picky, I would say sit in East stadium in the morning and west stadium in the evening."
4143,Date of experience: October 2017,28-Aug-18,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Best venue on the planet!,Husker fans are by far the best in college football. You will never go to a friendlier place with people who support their team like you will at Nebraska!
4144,Date of experience: August 2018,27-Aug-18,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,This Stadium is full of tradition plus you see outstanding football played most of the time.,Lots of places to see in Lincoln. The development of the Haymarket area is really nice. Many shops and places to eat that Lincoln did not have before this improvement.
4145,Date of experience: August 2018,27-Aug-18,Big Ten,Nebraska,3,University of Nebraska Football Stadium,"I had heard from my son that Memorial Stadium has a way that people can go inside the stadium and look onto the field and the stands. That??s true but it is sort of hidden and finding  it is extremely difficult. The university needs to add some signs directly visitors to it. Once I found it the view was great and I loved it, However the effort to find it on a hot day took out some of the pleasure."
4149,Date of experience: November 2017,6-Aug-18,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,WOW,This is a awesome place to see... if ever u get the chance to attend a game here do ur self a favor DONT PASS IT UP!!! Great people awesome food and a place everyone should experience!!!
4155,Date of experience: August 2017,18-Jun-18,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Best stadium,"Best stadium and training in the country.  The atmosphere of the whole place,the pride when they come through the tunnel, amd the music and all those red balloons.  Awesome!!!"
4156,Date of experience: October 2017,18-Jun-18,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,What can you say about this iconic place?,"There is no other place like Memorial Stadium on game day.  If you are looking for modern amenities like wide comfortable seats, plenty of leg room, and a view of the action unobstructed by people standing in front of you, it would be better to watch the game on TV.  However, if you want to be a part of the Sea of Red and have the best college football experience ever, you owe it to yourself to come to Lincoln and take in a Nebraska game on a fall Saturday."
4162,Date of experience: October 2017,4-Mar-18,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,"Amazing experience, always great day to be Big Red fan!","Husker fans are nice, love their football team and a great stadium to experience it all! The Railyard nearby is great, great food and fun atmosphere!"
4164,Date of experience: October 2017,3-Mar-18,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,Football,"No place like it anywhere else in Nebraska.  On a home football Saturday it becomes the third largest ""city"" in Nebraska with about 90,00 fans, a majority of them wearing red.  Hope springs eternal, with new head coach Scott Frost returning to his home state. He played quarterback at Nebraska the last time they won a national championship. Because of this for the first time the Stadium has been sold out for a spring practice game.  For regular season games it has been sold out since late 1962.  A NCAA record."
4165,Date of experience: October 2017,3-Mar-18,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Home of The Cornhuskers,"This is one place with SOLD OUT seats for decades!  In a home fame, this stadium turns into a ??sea of red??, people wearing The NE Cornhuskers red shirts shouting & cheering ??GO BIG RED??!  It??s a FUN PLACE & an exhilarating experience especially if you are a BIG RED fan!"
4166,Date of experience: September 2017,14-Feb-18,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,THE BEST FANS IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL!!,"A group of my friends travelled to Lincoln for the Oregon Ducks Football Game AT Nebraska....and we were blown away at how awesome the FANS were to us!!! I have never been treated so kindly as a Visitor Team. Nebraska Fans and the Memorial Stadium have SET THE BAR on how to be a GREAT FAN!!! Thank you Huskers, from a DUCK.  Robbie V."
4167,Date of experience: September 2017,4-Feb-18,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Gameday,"Amazing Place, steeped in Tradition.  Great views from anywhere in the Stadium.  First time in our lives to see the Huskers in person.  Cannot wait of 2018.  Let the Scott Frost Legacy Begin!!!"
4168,Date of experience: October 2017,31-Jan-18,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Game Day Marching Band Viewing,"Did you know that on a home football game day, the Cornhusker Marching Band can be found on the field 5 hours before kick off, practicing for that day's performance.  No admission required and you can watch the band from any outdoor seat in the stadium. You must enter the stadium through Gate 3.  If 5 hours is more than your looking for and you want to see them preform in uniform but don't have a ticket.... There's always the pre-game performance on the back lawn of the Lied Center for Performing Arts.  The drum line plays 1.5 hours before kickoff and the full band concert begins 1 hour before kick off.  Then, follow the band on their parade route, right to the stadium entrance.  It's a highly charged Hour even if you don't have a ticket!"
4169,Date of experience: January 2018,2-Jan-18,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,Good Stadium,"One of the best stadiums I??ve been to for a college.  Food and stuff overpriced, but what stadium isnt?"
4170,Date of experience: November 2017,24-Dec-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Game Day,No better game day experience in the country! Have been to most B1G & Big XII venues. None come close.
4171,Date of experience: September 2017,21-Dec-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,You have to see to believe!!,The atmosphere is electric!! The sea of red is mind boggling! It is the most amazing college football stadium I have ever been in
4172,Date of experience: November 2017,1-Dec-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Go Big Red!,I finally was able to see a football game at Memorial Stadium. It was amazing despite Nebraska's terrible second half performance. I wish I was able to see them in the '90s! I will certainly go to another game whenever possible.
4173,Date of experience: November 2017,29-Nov-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,GBR!,We went to the Iowa/Nebraska game. The record high temperatures and fun atmosphere made up for the miserable loss. Did you know you can go to Kimball hall on campus an hour before the game and watch the Cornhuskers marching band warm up and March into the stadium?! Highly recommend!
4174,Date of experience: November 2017,28-Nov-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,Impressive venue,"My son is considering attending Nebraska and wanted to see a game on campus.  We saw the Iowa game and despite the score, it was a very memorable experience.  A massive crowd and fun college football experience."
4175,Date of experience: November 2017,14-Nov-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,1,No more Husker football for us at Memorial Stadium,"Especially since my husband is a Husker football alumni (tackle, 1958-59 under Coach Bill Jenkins) we enjoy watching the Huskers play.  But we're tired of paying for tickets and not being able to see the game, because people in front of us stand for the entire game, blocking both the action on the field and our view of the the action on the screens placed in the corners.  Reminding them we cannot see and are not able to stand for two hours, and asking nicely for them to sit does no good.  We can only conclude that NU and other Nebraskans do not care about former players and/or senior citizen fans, and that apparently our money is not as good as as those who stand for the entire game."
4176,Date of experience: November 2017,11-Nov-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Northwestern v Nebraska,We made our first road trip to Nebraska and it was a huge success! We spent time on a local bar before the game and mingled with many friendly Nebraska fans. As we walked to the stadium we were warmly greeted by many Nebraska fans. Once inside we experienced the pride and pageantry of Husker Nation!! It was a memorable trip!
4177,Date of experience: November 2017,10-Nov-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,Husker Football Game with my son,"The people there are generally nice, the atmosphere was nice and the people were cheering like crazy. The Huskers aren't that of the 90's but what can you do. The best seats are club and upper deck so you can see the entire field without worrying about who is in front of you"
4178,Date of experience: November 2017,10-Nov-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,One of the great venues in College Sports,"I've been a regular at games since the early 1980s and when the crowd is on, there's no better sports venue anywhere.  Don't care for the ear shattering speaker volume used for music.  We used to go to the game and watch football, now it seems like every second the ball isn't moving, there's either loud music blasting or a commercial for the official whatever of Husker Football."
4179,Date of experience: October 2017,9-Nov-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Took my cousins to see the stadium.....,"Took my cousins to see the stadium.....by happenstance, ran into Coach Reilly.  Cousins got a their picture taken with Coach and his Grandson.  Can't say that the game turned out the way we'd like, but Coach was very nice and Generous with his time.  Made my cousins trip all worth the 1,200 Miles."
4180,Date of experience: September 2017,9-Nov-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Big Red with daughter,"This is an annual event for Dad and Daughter.  This was the 20th anniversary of the national champion 1997 football team. The environment was electric. With members of the 1997 coaches and team present, everyone was hopeful for a victory but Wisconsin had other ideas. Most of the game was watched from a standing position, but there is no better group to be part of then the Nebraska fan base. Wonder if the older part of the stadium will allow for larger people in the future."
4181,Date of experience: October 2017,8-Nov-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Best place on earth,If you like watching football in person.  This is the place to do it.  Been going here since early 70's and I still get goose bumps.
4182,Date of experience: October 2017,6-Nov-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,One of the best venues in college football,"I have always wanted to visit Memorial Stadium even before I was a Husker fan.  I had never been, but have had the opportunity to attend the last two home games (Ohio St and Northwestern).  While the Ohio St game was one of the worst games I have ever seen in person, the atmosphere was still amazing.  My 3 1/2 yr old daughter attended this game with me.  She was in awe the whole time, especially once she was given a red balloon.  The balloons are traditionally released when Nebraska scores their first points of the night.  Unfortunately, the team played so poorly the most people let the balloons go after the 2nd first down, which didn't occur until late in the 2nd quarter.  Thankfully we had great seats in row 7 on the 10 yd line and had a great view of the tunnel walk as well as the entire game.  I loved that staff hand out wristbands for children so they can write your name and phone number on them in case they get lost.  I have never seen this at such a large venue and thought it was a nice touch.  Overall, the fans and staff were amazing helping to make the experience the best I have had at a college football venue.The Northwestern game was much more competitive and went into OT.  Ironically we had 7th row tickets again, this time in the south endzone.  The seats were great and the stadium really gets rocking and loud when the team is competing.  Nearly 90,000 were in attendance for each game, making them the the largest games I have ever attended."
4183,Date of experience: November 2017,6-Nov-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,First Football Game,"It was my first experience at Memorial Stadium. Too convenient to access our gate, session and seat. The environment is amazing and very familiar."
4184,Date of experience: November 2017,5-Nov-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,A great first experience,"I attended my first Huskers game this weekend. I??ve been in the stadium before, just not for a game. Noise level was more tolerable than I expected. Free WiFi worked surprisingly well. Easy to get around in. It was a great experience overall."
4185,Date of experience: November 2017,5-Nov-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Great stadium,Wow!  Fantastic fans!  This place was full with excited and dedicated fans. Watched a great game. The Cornhuskers didn't win but it was a great game to watch. Loved the fan energy!
4186,Date of experience: October 2017,5-Nov-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,Fun stadium,We had a wonderful time ar the stadium! It is surrounded by a lot of fun bars. I recommend using the bathroom facilities before climbing the many steps to your seat. There are NO bathrooms on the upper levels!
4187,Date of experience: October 2017,29-Oct-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Great Stadium,"We had a nice visit during our Husker Fans Salute to the Troops weekend. The stadium is beautiful, clean and breathtaking all at the same time. They have great services and facilities for their student athletes. The staff and volunteers were very knowledgeable and friendly."
4188,Date of experience: October 2017,22-Oct-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Best Stadium the Is,You haven't lived until you have attended a game here! The best fans and the best atmosphere in college football!
4189,Date of experience: October 2017,21-Oct-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Impressive,"We were in the area, and who could resist a chance to check out the stadium. Its proximity to downtown is surprising, making it a convenient side trip.  This place is huge but camouflages well into its surroundings.  You can feel the energy even when empty."
4190,Date of experience: October 2017,18-Oct-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,"Wow, what a stadium!","If you are a college football fan, you must get to Memorial Stadium at least once in your life. What a cool experience to be in the 12th largest stadium. The sold-out crowd fill the stadium and there is a just a great energy."
4191,Date of experience: October 2017,18-Oct-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,One of college football's greatest,"We visited Memorial Stadium for the Ohio State - NE game. Being from Ohio we were unsure as to how we would be received, but were pleasantly surprised when the fans were extremely nice! We had great conversations with the fans around us, which overall made the experience even better. Prices inside the stadium for concessions are amazing! $3-$5 for everything from popcorn to soda (no alcohol sold inside). The concourses are updated and the stadium is easy to navigate. If you don't have tickets, using secondary market apps is the way to go, and you can get cheap seats if you wait until kickoff (which is what we did). Such a spectacle, and a must see for any college football fanatic."
4192,Date of experience: October 2017,18-Oct-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Huskers - OSU,Memorial Stadium is a great place to watch a football game. The tradition is as good as any in the nation. To get good parking you need to b early. U can watch the teams come in if u want.
4193,Date of experience: October 2017,16-Oct-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Must see for any football fan,"Stopped in on Friday before a Saturday game to see this historical stadium. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Incredibly impressive. Saw the Buckeyes beat the Huskers on Saturday and got to experience 89,406 fans! What an experience. The concourses are a bit challenging to navigate as they are not connected all the way around. You have to exit to get to the other side. Big time bucket list attending the game here."
4194,Date of experience: November 2016,11-Oct-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Game day is a must,"If you aren't a Nebraska Huskers fan you will be soon. Go to a football game at this stadium, you will love the atmosphere!"
4195,Date of experience: September 2017,3-Oct-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Spectacular setting,"Located on the University of Nebraska Lincoln campus Memorial Stadium is one of the premier venues in the country to take in a college football game.  Featuring a great atmosphere filled with passionate but friendly fans on game days, the stadium also has interesting architecture."
4198,Date of experience: September 2017,23-Sep-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Worth the trip!,"Attended my first Nebraska Cornhuskers football game. Drove from Illinois for this event. I've never seen team spirit like the Nebraska fans have for their Huskers! ?Nebraska folks sure are friendly and polite. In a stadium full of over 80,000 people, everyone was polite and not pushy getting around.The fireworks at touchdown time  were simply stunning."
4199,Date of experience: September 2017,18-Sep-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Great venue,Memorial Stadium in Lincoln is one of college football shrines. The game day atmosphere is outstanding and the fans are knowledgeable and friendly. I would highly recommend it to any college football fan.
4200,Date of experience: September 2017,15-Sep-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Nebraska's 3rd Largest City,"You can't describe a visit to Memorial Stadium in words, you have to experience it in person and believe me, if you have a heartbeat, the trip will be worth it.  I t doesn't matter what the score is or how the season is going, on game day, 80k Nebraskans will show up to cheer on their team and regardless of the outcome, respect the effort of the opposition.  If you are a fan of college football, even just a little, you can't go wrong here and the price of admission will be well worth it."
4201,Date of experience: September 2017,8-Sep-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Home opener football game,"This was our first time attending a game at Memorial Stadium.  The place is huge and beautiful.  It is so big it morphs the town.  It can hold over 90,000 people.  However, they do fit you in like sardines the atmosphere is one you have to experience."
4202,Date of experience: September 2017,6-Sep-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Nebraska football game,We went to the first game of the season and of course had a great time. We were in section 32 half way up and 10 seats from the new wrap around screens. The new screens are amazing and you see the game in a whole new way. There's nothing better than being apart of Husker Nation!
4204,Date of experience: September 2017,6-Sep-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,3,Iconic,"While the vibe during a game is unbelievable, the stadium is showing it's age. The aisles are very steep and narrow and the seats are , backless narrow and uncomfortable in most of the stadium. Many high school stadiums in Texas and throughout the South are more impressive.However it is mostly a moot point as fans stand throughout the game. I would love to investigate the higher price seat options so as to make the visit more enjoyable overall. GO BIG RED!"
4205,Date of experience: October 2016,6-Sep-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,2,Too big,"Too big, too many people, and too hard to get through traffic to get there.  I really don't see the point even when they were a good team.  Watch games at home.  Foods are over priced as well as, you guess it; long lines there, too."
4206,Date of experience: September 2017,4-Sep-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Just Awesome,Coming here on a  Husker Game Day is an awesome experience! You just can't beat the ambience and experience. If you don't like being shoulder to shoulder to others this won't be the place for you.
4207,Date of experience: September 2017,3-Sep-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Husker game Day,If you are a college football fan you need to experience Memorial Stadium on game Day.  Consecutive sell outs since 1961. Friendly fans.
4208,Date of experience: September 2017,3-Sep-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Excellent venue,I am an alum and was recently back for the 2017 Arkansas St. game.  Amazing atmosphere!  Great tradition.
4209,Date of experience: September 2017,2-Sep-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,No place like Nebraska!,Opening night game against Arkansas State and witness to the continuing sell-out streak since 1962.  Tight first half but hope the Huskers play better D in the second half!
4213,Date of experience: August 2017,17-Aug-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Family,The stadium is absolutely beautiful. It shows the pride of Nebraska. Cannot wait for that husker football to start. The kids absolutely love seeing the husker football team!!
4214,Date of experience: October 2016,8-Aug-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Best place for football??,The stadium is an excellent place to take in the Red White spring game or a regular home game.  Loud and fun place to be on Saturday.  The fly overs are awesome!
4215,Date of experience: August 2017,6-Aug-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,See the trophies,Grandpa graduated from here many years ago. Son also loves the Huskers. So we stopped at 9 on this Sunday morning before we returned home to Illinois. We stopped in the Suh Strength and Conditioning building to see the national championship trophies plus all the other trophies. We parked right in front of the building since there were no practices going on and the school year hasn't begun. A real treat for father and son.
4217,Date of experience: October 2016,21-Jul-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Australian in Nebraska,"A good american friend of mine managed to get me tickets to last years game against Illinois and it was one hell of a game day experience. From the UNL book store (where I bought a compulsory red polo shirt) to the tail gaters to the old football gates to our seats, the experience is just so so unique.  You don't have to be a football fan to enjoy game day at Memorial Stadium"
4218,Date of experience: October 2016,20-Jul-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,Rich in Tradition!!,"If you have never visited this stadium on a football Saturday you are missing out on a fantastic experience. AND, what awesome fans!!!"
4219,Date of experience: October 2016,20-Jul-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Touring the stadium,My friend and I went exploring shortly after a football game when the fans cleared out. The views from the top seats are amazing!  The atmosphere can't be understood from a picture. You have to experience in person.
4220,Date of experience: October 2016,19-Jul-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Busker Home,"This stadium is well thought out with concessions and restrooms strategically located.  There are usually lines to get to your seats if you wait until 15 minutes before kickoff.  Getting out after games takes patience too.  Moving 90,000 people takes time."
4221,Date of experience: November 2016,19-Jul-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Been to over 175 games,"My review is severely slanted.  I love this place.  I grew up watching Nebraska football in this stadium.  My first game was in 1971, when I was 5 years old.  I have froze here, nearly had heat stroke.  I have cheered, laughed and cried.  Someone once coined the phrase ""Memorial Stadium...the nicest place you will ever lose""  I love that.  The Huskers are not the powerhouse that they were in the 70's, 80's and 90's, but the home crowd is still second to none.  If you are in to leg room, and comfort; this may not be the place for you.  There is truly NO PLACE LIKE NEBRASKA!  Go Big Red"
4222,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Jul-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Temple of the Nebraskan Tribe,"If you are a fan of college football, this is a MUST SEE.  Even if you are not a Husker fan, the impact of Nebraska Football on college sports is undisputable.  I personally think these Nebraska folk are nuts, but then who am I to judge, I'm an outsider here.  I must confess I do like Tom Osborne and Bob Devaney as coach figures.  You will not be disappointed if you are a true football fan."
4223,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Jul-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Very welcoming,It's one of those places u have to experience once in your live time specially a husker home game. The husker fans are the best in college conference.
4224,Date of experience: September 2016,10-Jul-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Attended a football game.,The stadium when full of Husker fans wearing red is awesome! The Tunnel Walk sends chills down me every time :)

4229,Date of experience: August 2016,5-Jul-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,2,Only for husker fans,"Not much of interest here unless you are a husker head. A lot of history of the team, broadcasting and football in Nebraska."
4230,Date of experience: September 2016,1-Jul-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Must do if you have the chance,"A visit to memorial stadium on game day is a truly memorable occasion, especially if the Huskers win.  Great atmosphere, both in and around the stadium."
4231,Date of experience: December 2016,28-Jun-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Go Big Red,"I've been coming to games at Memorial Stadium my whole life. I have attended too many football games to count, sold, concessions, and walked by it every day on my way to class. I have seen the stadium transform over the years to be what is is now. It massive, beautiful, and its facilities rival, and are better than most Professional League Facilities. Go Big Red - there is no place like Nebraska!"
4232,Date of experience: October 2016,25-Jun-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,It's fun,The fans in Nebraska are great.  The stadium is a nice place to watch a good team play football.  The seats are comfortable and the food in the stadium is good as well.

4242,Date of experience: September 2016,18-May-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,It's Husker Football!,Unsure why anyone needs to review Memorial Stadium. Of course it's GREAT!  Game days are fun ..love my team. My seats are up high but I can see great and get in and out fine. Don't show up 15 minutes before kick off--arrive at least 30 minutes prior to get in your seat and get ready!
4245,Date of experience: October 2016,28-Apr-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Husker Mania!,"Even if you are not a Husker fan the stadium has tons of interesting history on the football, volley ball and other programs.  Great statues and memorabilia.  Just one tidbit is that they started out as the BUG EATERS!"
4249,Date of experience: September 2016,29-Mar-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,OREGON VS NEBRASKA,"Nice stadium, good seats all way around, we were there for the 350 sell out in a row. Fans were great even though we are Oregon fans. People went out of their to be nice and say high enjoy your stay. I mean nicest fans we have ever been around. The only downside is they do not sell beer at the games. You have to drink before going in there are several places to do that! You have to try the Runza........be careful or you will torch the top of your mouth served hot but awesome."
4250,Date of experience: September 2016,24-Mar-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Memorial Stadium on game day.,"If you haven't been there, give it a try.  I've been going there for 65 years.  It represents the tolerance and the sportsmanship and the character of the Nebraska fans.  Give it a try if you get a chance."
4254,Date of experience: October 2016,11-Mar-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Go Huskers!,"We have season tickets, so we are at the stadium on a weekly basis. This facility is continually cleaned and updated. The crowds are large on game days, but that's the atmosphere of Husker football."
4255,Date of experience: November 2016,8-Mar-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Football MECCA!,"Over the past 55 years, I have missed a total of 7, yes 7, home games of the Huskers.  I have seen the stadium grow from sideline stands to a full bowl, now seating over 91,000 fans.  It is not just bigger, it is better, each time it expands.  Club seats are fantastic.  The best football stadium for a terrific time--GO HUSKERS!"
4257,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Feb-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Husker Heaven,This is the place to be on Saturdays in the Fall to see the Husker home games. There hasn't been an unsold seat since 1962 but you are usually able to find tickets for sale in the downtown area.
4259,Date of experience: November 2016,13-Feb-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Memorial Stadium - Home of the Huskers,"If you love college football, you need to stop by here.  If you are lucky enough to go to a game here - that is about as good as it gets.  Going to the Annual Red/White game in the spring is an inexpensive way to really take in Husker Football.  Red/White is the Husker team playing against each other.  Once in the stadium, you may hear a GOOOOOOO  BIG REDDDDDDD SHOUT."
4260,Date of experience: November 2016,13-Feb-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,No Place In The World Like It!,The sea of red on a football Saturday is nothing like you've ever seen before.  The fans are hard core and the stadium staff does all they can to keep the atmosphere family friendly and enjoyable for all.
4262,Date of experience: November 2016,27-Jan-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Awesome,I could walk around the stadium for hours....amazing experience. You can't help but get Husker fever when you are in or nearby the stadium.
4263,Date of experience: November 2016,18-Jan-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Go Big Red,"I have gone to the games since college starting in 1962. Always enjoyable and great atmosphere. Even the visiting teams are saluted. I cannot comment on the food in the boxes high above the rest of us but the food in the south stadium is 'so so"" not much flavor. Hot dogs from the vendor in the stands do not offer mustard as you must go down to the food booth.  You only get Pepsi products, also Valentino pizza and Runza. We have season tickets and love going to the games. They did put rails with Wi-Fi boxes in the aisle to help us old folks and get better cell service. Great place that seats well over 90,000 fans. Constant sell out for over 300 games."
4264,Date of experience: October 2016,17-Jan-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,terrific atmosphere,Be prepared to be swamped in red and white!!!!  It's an awesome site!  Great place with great fans and lots of fun!
4265,Date of experience: January 2017,11-Jan-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Do Not Miss This Place..... Must See,A very satisfying place to be.  I was quite fortunate to walk through the hallway viewing all of the trophies and Nebraska football regalia before I walked out on the field.  Absolutely stunning feeling.  I'm even a Ohio State Buckeye and Texas Tech fan.An absolute honor to be here!Definitely come to this place.
4266,Date of experience: August 2016,4-Jan-17,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,The shrine of Husker Football,What can anyone say about Memorial Stadium? It is the third-largest city in NE on game day; the place rocks when the crowd gets roaring; it is just an unforgettable experience.
4268,Date of experience: November 2016,22-Dec-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,Just visit for the tradition and see what a First Class football program is,I have been a season ticket holder since 1964 when the South addition was opened. I have been to all the home games but 5. I am now getting too old to really enjoy the fun as walking to stadium is a chore.They also never put rails to hang on to while going up or down steps in my section but they have updated the stadium with screens and loud music. It is a sight for strangers to see or attend a game there.
4269,Date of experience: September 2016,21-Dec-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,Lots of excitement,It was fun going and watching the football game. I am not a fan of large crowds so we don't go anymore. The lady behind us had kids and none of them watched any of the game. The kids had candy and food which ended up all over the people in front of them. I would suggest leaving the little kids home so everyone paying the high price for tickets can enjoy the game.
4270,Date of experience: October 2016,1-Dec-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Amazing pride,"Memorial Stadium is an amazing site to see.  The pride this University carries for it's athletic program is amazing.  The stadium is beautiful, a great site to see."
4271,Date of experience: November 2016,29-Nov-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,There is no place like Nebraska,"I have been to more games here than I can count, and there is no experience on the planet like joining the Sea of Red. Nebraska fans are the most courteous and knowledgeable fan base you will find anywhere. Make sure you get there early to watch warmups and the tunnel walk. Nebraska fans fill the stadium early, so don't plan on cruising in at the last minute and being able to slide into your seat."
4272,Date of experience: November 2016,23-Nov-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Awesome!,"The stadium has changed a lot over the past 20 years since I was a kid. However it still has a nice intimate feel and the fans are so friendly. I'm sure newer stadiums are slicker, but the tradition at NU is palpable throughout the stadium. Getting in and seated doesn't take longer than 10 minutes or so if you arrive 30-45 min before kick off. Parking and walking to the stadium totally depends on where you park. (Can't help you there...) ;)"
4273,Date of experience: November 2016,23-Nov-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Football Trip,"First time at Memorial Stadium. I will be back. My team was the visitor, but the Nebraska fans were welcoming, classy, and very hospitable. Our seats were great and were very close to our teams tunnel walk. The night game added to a great atmosphere. While the sections aren't as clearly marked as other stadiums I've been to, the locals did a nice job of helping us get to where we were seated. I've become a fan of Nebraska football because of this trip. I only wish opposing fans were treated with as much respect everywhere as we were shown in Lincoln. GBR."
4274,Date of experience: November 2016,20-Nov-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,3,Go Huskers!,"I am from out-of-town, and may have different expectations because of experience with a newer, smaller stadium.  Memorial Stadium is an older stadium, crowded seating, downtown location, narrow stairways.  Can be difficult for handicapped visitors to navigate.  If you are coming for a game, be sure to be seated an hour before kickoff, as getting to your seat will be difficult."
4275,Date of experience: November 2016,20-Nov-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Not much beats a Cornhusker game at Memorial Stadium!,We try to go at least once a year... We usually stay in Omaha and make the drive before and after the game but this year stayed in Lincoln. Fantastic experience - Don't forget come November to dress in layers and bring your hat and sunglasses!
4276,Date of experience: November 2016,20-Nov-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,GBR!,"The WiFi is great, the student radio station broadcasts the game without a delay and the doorman and elevator operators are very personable. Always a great time!"
4277,Date of experience: November 2016,19-Nov-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,The Best,"First, I am a Nebraska fan so I am biased. I had not been to a home game in 25 years and was shocked when I walked in. The concessions are cheap when compared to other stadiums. The people working were extremely helpful and courteous! Hopefully I will not have to wait another 25 years to go back."
4279,Date of experience: November 2016,19-Nov-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Huskers vs Maryland,Never disappoints.  Took stepson and friend to 11am game.  28 degrees but electric atmosphere.  There is a reason why it has sold out for so long!  Plus huskers won!
4280,Date of experience: November 2016,15-Nov-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,3,Lots of tradition but definitely needs an upgrade!,"We went to a game at Memorial stadium. I was surprised at the distance to walk from our seats to the bathroom! Also, whatever happened to vendors selling food or drinks in the stands?"
4281,Date of experience: November 2016,15-Nov-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Nebraska game,"Came up from Oklahoma to watch the Huskers play.  First time is the stadium and it was awesome.  Toured the facilities and watched a great game with my brothers,nephew, and uncle.  Go Huskers!"
4282,Date of experience: November 2016,15-Nov-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Best Stadium and fans in College Football,"Memorial Stadium brings a one of a kind game day experience to college football fans. If your team plays the Huskers, come to the game and be amazed at how you are treated while in Lincoln and at the game. Nothing like it anywhere else in the country."
4283,Date of experience: November 2016,15-Nov-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,2,Only For the Faithful.,"Unless you are a diehard Husker fan, this is just another old, tired football stadium that is not particularly fan-friendly, nor that good for watching a game.  For some reason, the University decided to add even more inaccessible, uncomfortable seats, forcing them to lean heavily on their pool of wealthy donors to insure that their precious sell-out streak endures, even though whenever the TV cameras accidentally pan across the upper levels, the seats are more than half-empty.  Such is life in big-time college football these days."
4284,Date of experience: September 2016,15-Nov-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Nebraska Football Game,"Love the atmosphere! Wish i could go to every game, we love our Huskers. Amazing place to visit if you like football."
4285,Date of experience: November 2016,13-Nov-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Beautiful Place,If you get a chance go to this stadium. It is truly beautiful and has so much tradition.  Championship Trophies on display...
4286,Date of experience: September 2016,10-Nov-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Truely an Awesome Stadium!,Love memorial stadium for Husker Football. There Is No Place Like Nebraska!  So exciting to be with 70 thousand other Husker fans on football Saturday.  Love the food offered.  Could have more bathrooms though.
4288,Date of experience: October 2016,8-Nov-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,No place better for a Husker!,"an older stadium with extensive modernization there is no place better on a Saturday.  It can be crowded and loud but thats part of its ""charm"""
4289,Date of experience: December 2015,1-Nov-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,"Very fun, the kids loved it.","I have a family of football players and fans, so this was a huge hit.  One of those places you dream about seeing if your a husker fan!"
4290,Date of experience: September 2016,26-Oct-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,No Other Destination is Like It!,"A life-long Husker fan, there's no better place to watch a football game than at Memorial Stadium. It's only bettered by a Runza and a win!"
4292,Date of experience: September 2016,25-Oct-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,"Shrine to Football, and it's Fans.","Memorial Stadium, when full, seats approx.. 93,000 fans!  That makes it the 3rd largest city in Nebraska, smack in the middle of downtown Lincoln.  If you ever get a chance to visit the stadium on a tour, or simply attend any game there, you will be amazed.  The engineers and designers have obviously worked overtime to make sure there isn't a bad seat in the house.  The Big Red Culture in Lincoln is HUGE!  Tailgating often starts the day before the games, and a great many tailgaters don't even go to the games, they just enjoy the atmosphere and presence of thousands of other Husker fans.  Many bring in trailers or party buses, and set up grills and bars. Bring plenty of cash; for game tickets sold on the streets, to every possible variation of Husker-wear: hats and shirts and bib overalls, socks, and shoes and glasses, jewelry and temporary tattoos.  IF you are coming in from out of town, MAKE YOUR HOTEL RESERVATIONS EARLY!!!  And I mean EARLY!.  Uber and Lyft operate nearly 24/7, I strongly recommend either.  Overall- the Big Red phenomenon is not to be missed!"
4293,Date of experience: October 2016,25-Oct-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,GO BIG RED!,"We were at the stadium for the Purdue game 10.22.16.  I have a handicap sticker as I have Stage 4 cancer.  The parking was easy and we were driven to the stadium in a golf cart.  Getting back to the parking ramp was a bit of a wait but not bad.  for 90,540 some people, it was a great experience.  My daughter is a graduate and it was fun to come and watch a game and be part of the crowd!"
4294,Date of experience: October 2016,23-Oct-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,Great experience,"I took m y daughter to her first game this year and she loved it!  The tunnel walk, fireworks, band, music, and the game itself blew her away."
4296,Date of experience: October 2016,19-Oct-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Husker fan,"Memorial stadium is one of the best places in the USA to attend a college football game. It can hold 90,000+ fans since recent renovation and the big screen is amazing. Also the ribbon board screens on each side are fun. Concessions are great and accessibility is good. The volunteers who work the gates and aisles are knowledgeable and always helpful. I have been to many college stadiums and Memorial stadium may not be the biggest but it is certainly one of the best"
4297,Date of experience: September 2016,17-Oct-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Father Daughter BE vs Oregon,"What a great game. Memorial stadium was rocking. Our seats are in the old part of the East Stadium. A tight fit but great time. Vendors did a good job bringing cold drinks, pizza and hot dogs. The hot dog shooter found us at the tailgate prior to the game. What was really amazing was the graciousness of both fans. Restaurants paid for Oregon fan dinners, and NU fans complimented the team to the OU fans. This made up for the heat. Only in Nebraska."
4298,Date of experience: September 2016,17-Oct-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Amazing environment!,"Every seat is filled for every game since 1962. You don't realize the tradition of this great stadium until you see that part of it was constructed in 1936. The original flavor and atmosphere was preserved with each addition, now holding over 92,000 seats. It really is the third largest city in Nebraska on game day."
4299,Date of experience: September 2016,17-Oct-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,Great atmosphere but seating is way to small,This is a must do at least once even if you are not a huge football fan. The atmosphere is absolutely amazing. Don't plan on being comfortable while you are there. I am not a fat person but the seats are so close together. No leg room and you will know your neighbor intimately before the game is over.
4300,Date of experience: September 2016,17-Oct-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,"Fun, Fun, Fun","Football games, sold out stadiums, tailgating doesn't get much better. Very crowded but the people are still friendly. Bad traffic for an hour afterwards. One thing you have to put up with."
4301,Date of experience: September 2016,9-Oct-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Great football stadium!,"When Oregon played Nebraska this Sept, we were fortunate enough to go to the game. To be part of the Nebraska football experience in this stadium was amazing! From the stadium, the tailgating, the campus, and the people! It was one of the best away football game experiences that we have ever had, and we lost the game. Go figure!!Everyone can learn from the folks in Nebraska. The hospitality, the warmth, kindness, and generosity is unmatched to anywhere we have ever been."
4302,Date of experience: September 2016,9-Oct-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,The beating heart of the state...,"As a well-traveled native Nebraskan who's seen about every square mile of the state for its precious, and often sublime, beauty, it's not without ambivalence that I call Memorial Stadium the beating heart of the state - perhaps risking feeding into the staid stereotype of Nebraskans being simple Husker football fanatics. But Memorial Stadium on gameday IS the heart and soul of its population and offers a glimpse into the nice, goodhearted, and passionate people that call the state home."
4303,Date of experience: October 2016,8-Oct-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,Neat,"My kid was really excited to see the stadium. I found it confusing to find the public parking area, but that was probably just me!"
4305,Date of experience: October 2016,5-Oct-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Home Husker Game.,Go Big Red. Been here several times and never gets old. The sea of red and the roar of the crowd is awesome. One has to be apart of this at least once in their life.
4306,Date of experience: October 2016,2-Oct-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,No better place for college football,Wonderful place to see a college football game.  Tremendous history and atmosphere in this stadium.  Worth the trip.
4307,Date of experience: September 2016,1-Oct-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Huskers-- Enough Said,"You cannot go to Lincoln without going to a Husker game.  It is an unbelievable place to be on game day!  The fans are gracious.  Red balloons are let go after the first Husker touchdown, which is very cool.  The jumbotron is amazing The local food is so good--Runza and Valentinos!!"
4308,Date of experience: September 2016,24-Sep-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,GBR,"GBR, well if you haven't Ben here you missed a lot as there is no place like Nebraska when it comes to college football."
4309,Date of experience: September 2016,23-Sep-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,350th Consecutive Sellout,"Huskers vs Ducks, arrived 2 1/2 hours early. Not easy to get to, parking very limited near stadium. The trophy room, at north end of the stadium, was impressive, especially the National Championship's display case. An added benefit was the restrooms. Our seats were decent, but we were extremely squished by very large people on either side. We noticed fans coming in w/ rented cushioned stadium seats, that would be the way to go. The digital screens were small and half of the screen was taken up advertising, hard to read. But good game and was fun to see the Nebraska fans and their love for football."
4310,Date of experience: September 2016,21-Sep-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Best Stadium Experience Ever!!!,"When driving down the road, you can see the big N from far away and it's a beautiful stadium!  Fun statues, and even a new memorial area for the punter, Sam Fultz.  It was awesome to go into the sports area of the Stadium and see all of the trophies and awards.  We even got to say hi to Tommy Armstrong as he was walking in!"
4311,Date of experience: September 2016,20-Sep-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,3rd biggest city of Nebarskan single minded folks,a huge facility and a great long time venue where some fans are a bit entitled and don't value the other fan
4312,Date of experience: September 2016,20-Sep-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,It's great,"Great atmosphere, friendly but passionate fans. Bathrooms are plentiful, nice and clean. We've never had any problems getting in or out of the stadium. If you try and leave town immediately after the game you'll get stuck in traffic for an hour. But that's expected when 100k people are loaded in a stadium. Walking distance to bars and restaurants. Make sure this is on your bucket list."
4313,Date of experience: September 2016,20-Sep-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Nebraska beat Oregon,Best place to be on home game Saturdays !!!!! Even if you are not a fan...you should buy tickets and attend.
4314,Date of experience: September 2016,20-Sep-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,A Walk Through Nebraska Football History,"Great opportunity to take a walk through the years of ""Husker"" football.  Awesome to be able to see up-close the crystal National Championship trophies and the 3 Heismanns.  Going the day before game day will allow you easy viewing and no crowds."
4315,Date of experience: September 2016,17-Sep-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,A Football Monument,"Here's the ""Honest Scoop""-First time visit.  Ginormous.  Friendly locals, and updated facilities.  Enjoyed the Club Level."
4316,Date of experience: September 2016,17-Sep-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Impressive,"If you are from Nebraska you just know about this place.  If you are Husker fan you've probably been here, possibly multiple times, or are just waiting and hoping for your chance to go.  The experience of this place on game day is something that you will not find in many places.  It's always sold out on game day and there are now over 85 thousand seats here now.  Game day transforms the city for a few hours, it's a interesting experience and one you will not forget.  The place is steeped in tradition and history.  Yes the stadium looks fresh and updated on the outside, but parts of the old stadium remain preserved intact inside of the new facade so that you can look back in time to the way the stadium used to look.  The history is one of my favorite things about this building.  If you haven't been to a game here, you need to go and experience it.  The fans are known for being respectful to visitors and not harassing them, outside of friendly jabs."
4317,Date of experience: September 2016,15-Sep-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,3,Arrived early for Ducks game.,"Always want to see the game venue beforehand when ever I go to an away game. There was no visitor center or something to see about the rich history of the great Husker tradition. Fortunately a janitor told us about an unlocked gate through which we could enter the stadium to at least see the field. A little disappointed in not learning more about national and conference titles, Heisman's etc. Still plan on a great game day experience."
4318,Date of experience: October 2015,15-Sep-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,The Best of the Huskers,"Memorial Stadium is a must see venue when we have out of town guests.  To understand the history and tradition of Nebraska football, the stadium is a great place to visit.  If you are a Husker Fan or even have a passing interest in Husker football, this is a place you should take time to visit."
4319,Date of experience: September 2016,15-Sep-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Holy Grail of College Football,"This is one of the elite college football stadiums. Too many historic games have been played here to list. Consecutive sellouts since 1962!! Even if your not a husker fan, it is worth the trip to experience a football game in this stadium. The sea of red is awesome, the release of red balloons after the first score is always an awesome sight, and the facilities have been upgraded throughout the years to make the stadium much more comfortable."
4320,Date of experience: September 2016,14-Sep-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,GBR,What can one say that has not been said?     Best venue in all of sports.   Any college football fan will appreciate.

Looking forward to going again sometime soon I hope! Not a  bad seat in the house (seats like 86,000 fans) should have rented a stadium seat to secure space, but fans were kind to move around when needed...."
4325,Date of experience: September 2016,11-Sep-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,Nebraska Wyoming game,"Impressive stadium, but they need to start making wide people pay for more than one seat like some airlines.  You need to rent one of the stadium seats to secure your space or you may end up with only 10 inches to sit on.  I  also wish they would do something less harmful to the environment than the balloon release for the first husker touchdown."
4326,Date of experience: September 2016,8-Sep-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,A view from the outside.,"Memorial Stadium is huge and imposing from every angle especially from the highway. Up close, you can only see snippets at a time. If you can get a ticket to go in, you gotta go. Beautiful!"
4327,Date of experience: October 2015,7-Sep-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Most beautiful college stadium,"Hopefully everyone can experience the excitement of a Husker football game at least once in their life. Nebraska is known for their loyal, friendly fans. The stadium is beautiful."
4328,Date of experience: September 2016,6-Sep-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Go Big Red - Go Big Red!,"Attended our 1st college football game here with my wife and brother-in-law. WOW! 90,000 people in one place---its the third largest ""city"" in Nebraska on Saturdays in the fall. Only Omaha and Lincoln have more people in one place on a Saturday. Great place to experience a game!"
4329,Date of experience: September 2016,4-Sep-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Fun atmosphere,"The fans are super hospitable, the tickets are affordable, tailgating is a blast, and the stadium is really nice. I had a blast at the first game this season and was really happy the Huskers won, even though I'm not from here. Apparently the stadium becomes the ""third largest city"" in Nebraska during home games. Highly recommend to those who find themselves in Lincoln during football season!"
4331,Date of experience: September 2016,3-Sep-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Husker Season Opener,"Sold out since 1962, I love to see games here.  Crowd is knowledgeable and polite to visitors.  New addition features elevators and fan amenities including wifi.  But, it is the love affair of the state of Nebraska with the team that makes it oh so special."
4332,Date of experience: September 2016,2-Sep-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,"Seriously, There is No Place like Nebraska!","One word of advice: do come early and experience it all for yourself. First off there's the Husker Pavillion, which happens on the practice field, where kids and adults of all ages can enjoy some free goodies and fun games before kickoff (seriously great for kids, it'll wear them right out!) There's also the Haymarket area, which is just a short walk from the stadium, this is a great place to pick up breakfast and coffee from the local farmers market that runs on Saturdays!THIS BEING SAID, Forget what you thought you knew about college football, because, win or lose, Nebraska's fans and stadium will change it all! Having grown up in Nebraska and now moved, I think I can speak for all transplants when I say that you can't find the atmosphere that exists with Husker fans and Memorial Stadium. Sox fans at Fenway Park get close, but still don't quite hold the same sincere adoration, thick-or-thin like Husker fans do.Even if you aren't a huge football fan, or maybe even root for another team, (we won't hold it against you, (much!)) seeing a home game at Memorial Stadium is a must-do for any visitor. The energy and camaraderie exuded by Husker fans makes the air around the stadium on game day just crackle with excitement! On top of our fans being just so darn excited, Husker Nation is also lauded as some of the best fans in college football, meaning even if you root for the other guys, you won't experience poor sportsmanship or serious heckling from Husker fans, which makes the game all the more fun!In all seriousness, these fans and this stadium are an absolute blast. The music is great, the food and atmosphere are excellent, and Husker Nation turns out in spades to cheer on our boys in the scarlet & cream. My advice? Jump right on in and enjoy the heart and soul of college football. Husker fans will treat you like one of our own :)"

Ann Arbor, Austin, Oxford, Eugene, Norman, etc do it right but there's no place like Nebraska.  None."
4335,Date of experience: August 2016,26-Aug-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,This is Huge,"First thing I saw when I flew in and on my drive. I thought, hum...I need to get in there and check it out. I'm so glad I did. This stadium is breathtaking. As a visiting team,I think I would be so overwhelmed. It's huge. The noise must be deafening. I would recommend getting a tour or going to a game here and checking out the sites."
4336,Date of experience: November 2015,23-Aug-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Atmosphere of College Excitement on Home Game Day!,"I have been to many other college stadiums.  Game Day is like no other for College Sports.  Memorial Stadium is no exception.  The sea of Red in Memorial Stadium to the Tunnel Walk...it's spine chilling greatness. Students, fans, tailgates, fun, personable and will never disappoint. Nebraska fans, less the few, are genuinely excited.   Husker fans are happy to welcome their opponent and truly want the experience of their visit to be pleasant...the ultimate thank you is when they hear ""look forward to returning""!!"
4338,Date of experience: October 2015,21-Aug-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Nothing like it,There truly is nothing like being in a sold out stadium on a crisp fall afternoon where the stadium becomes the third largest city in the state.
4339,Date of experience: October 2015,17-Aug-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Can't Beat This Place on a Fall Saturday Afternoon During a Home Game!,"Even if you're not a Husker fan (and if you aren't then you should be) you'll find the visit worth while.  One of the largest college football stadiums in the country (seats nearly 100,000 people) it's also well run, beautifully maintained and a TON of fun!Parking can be a bit of a tangle, but students and residents often offer reasonably priced parking (5.00-10.00) to park in their driveways within easy walking of the stadium and it's a great idea to park there to avoid traffic on the way in and out!"
4340,Date of experience: September 2015,12-Aug-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Husker Nation,"The stadium is a staple of the UNL campus and Lincoln in general.  Everytime I go to a game it is packed with record breaking attendance.  Also, I love that they serve local food: Valentino's & Runza."
4344,Date of experience: August 2016,3-Aug-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Go big red!,"During football season, this is like a main attraction! The stadium accommodates thousands of people! I think it's really neat that they don't serve alcohol. It makes for a friendly environment with fans from all over!"
4345,Date of experience: August 2016,3-Aug-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Best stadium in college football,No better stadium or team in the country. Nicest fans you'll ever meet. GameDay is like nothing else.

4351,Date of experience: November 2015,26-Jul-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,Must see,"You may not like football or the Huskers, but this is a ""not to be missed"" experience.  Nice fans, tons of atmosphere and something you should have on your bucket list.  Even if u can't get tickets to the game, come on down and either buy from ""that guy"" or stop at a tailgate and watch on their TV.  Uber down, parking is tough.  Or wear your comfy shoes and be prepared to walk.  If you're lucky, you'll catch the band marching through campus to the stadium, lots of fun and great way to get the party started."
4352,Date of experience: October 2015,26-Jul-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Huskers!!!!!,The best stadium atmosphere ever! I love taking my kids to games here friends and fun every where you look!!!!

4356,Date of experience: October 2015,13-Jul-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Awesome place to watch the Huskers.,"Friendly stadium. Friendly fans. I'm always surprised at how easy it is to get in and out. The only downside is that the standard seats are tiny, especially when sitting next to a corn-fed Husker fan. (Although, this is a plus when it's freezing cold and the seats are in the shade) The club level, however, is heaven on earth."
4361,Date of experience: November 2015,5-Jul-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Game Days!,"On Nebraska Football game days this place is rockin'! Filled with fans, bands, food and excitement.  The stadium itself is nestled on UNL campus in the heart of downtown Lincoln.  A walk through the parklike campus is a treat. You can meet and greet fans, visit the Sheldon Art Museum or Morrill Hall and collect red balloons to celebrate the 1st touchdown."

4367,Date of experience: November 2015,22-May-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,Fans Are A Class Act But Stadium Hard Place For Opponents,"Very intimidating place to play a football game.  The way the stadium is designed, it seems that more fans sit in the end zones than between the goal lines.   Although a lot of seats have not so great views in the end zone, it is an absolutely brilliant design.   When your team gets backed on the goal line or is trying to score, the rabid Nebraska fans make it very unpleasant for the visiting team."
4368,Date of experience: November 2015,18-May-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,SERIOUSLY - A must for college football lovers everywhere!!,"Just like the song says, ""There is NO place like Nebraska - good ol' Nebraska U!""  This stadium, this school, this state ... the 2nd largest city in Nebraska any Saturday there is a home football game in Lincoln.  My mom and I were season ticket holders for 20+ years, and each week was a new experience ... whether it was trying to drink enough water to stay hydrated at the beginning of the season to trying to dress warm enough at the end - LOL!  The party begins outside the stadium for about a mile in any direction HOURS before kick-off ... be in your seats right when the gate opens to watch the stadium fill with RED and do some serious people-watching!!  You'll meet some truly amazing people with amazing stories to share - like backyard neighbors.  The stadium itself has some truly incredible history, tour the facility, etc.  Memories to last a lifetime in my case!"

It's Nebraska's third largest city when the Huskers play.  You might also want to check out the Heisman and other trophies on display or take in many sights around this ever growing stadium.

We've heard that this us the third largest city on game day. It is so nice with the additions over the years. More parking has been added, but there is buses running frequently from various sites around town, a lot of food venues and shopping nearby. Come early and enjoy the fans!"

The atmosphere is electric in the ""sea of red.""  The stadium was built following WWI honoring those who fought.  It has been renovated several times but retains the essence of the original design and has preserved the old game clock in the concourse.  Beware that it gets crowded on game day but is well worth the effort to see the Cornhuskers.  Traditional football game fare is available at the various concessions stands including Nebraska original Runzas and Valentino's pizza."

I am from Sydney Australia and I spent 5 months living in Lincoln, this was definitely like nothing else I've ever seen! The level of dedication and passion from Nebraska fans is very unique and makes his stadium different! Band playing, balloons released at the first touchdown and an incredible atmosphere. The games have been sold out every year since 1964 and for good reason. Can't wait to go back!"
4391,Date of experience: September 2015,22-Feb-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,No Place Like Memorial Stadium,"This is one of the premier college sports venues in the nation. The fans are courteous, Nebraska Nice. The north stadium always applauds the visiting team at the end of the game regardless of winner or loser, regardless of the score. The scoreboards are awesome with regular replays of all the action. Concessions include local specialties of Fairbury hot dogs, Valentinos' Pizza, and Runza (pirage type sandwich) Sandwiches. A Nebraska Football game is an event that you will remember for the rest of your life."

The stadium itself is quite updated.  I've sat in general admission, the press box, as well as one of their suites, and had a wonderful experience in all locations.  Whether the Huskers are winning or losing, the fans are great.  Win or lose, the crowd will always applaud the opposing team when they leave the field.  Overall, I recommend this venue to anyone who enjoys the college football experience."

4397,Date of experience: November 2015,5-Jan-16,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,Go Big Red but watch the stairs!,"We love going to Memorial Stadium to watch the Huskers! We sat in an area that was under the balcony this last time and were disappointed that we couldn't see the big screens or the score. We didn't have a view of the TV's either so it was difficult. We love the Huskers, and of course, we'll return to watch them....but visibility could have been better under the balcony."
4398,Date of experience: November 2015,30-Dec-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Every Football Fanatics Dream!,"If you are a college football fanatic and want to visit as many major stadiums as possible this has to be your TOP 5!!! I've been to Death Valley at LSU vs Bama in 2014 and I honestly don't think it beats the total experience you get from a Husker game. We tailgated and checked everything out around. The way everything is set up is the best. Everything is right in one spot. All your game day activities and tailgating is all right next to the stadium and it makes for a convenient experience. You also have the Railyard which is a REALLY cool spot. A huge TV outside and all this stuff, just an awesome outside party going one there. Then you go into the stadium. WOW. It just hits you once you finally get out the tunnel. It's a very beautiful sight. The Husker Power chant is my favorite as it roars and echos throughout. When the fans start doing the wave to really make it the Sea Of Red. The Micheal Jackson song that comes at Kickoff is unique and chilling. THE WHOLE PLACE IS SO UNIQUE. The history is a wonder, it's written on the walls. It's a beautiful place. The fans are sooo nice and make for a very enjoyable experience. I recommend a night game and I promise you will never forget the way you feel. If you're not a Husker fan don't worry you need to go check it out and just enjoy and relax. You'll have an amazing experience. 'Through These Gates'"

And had never been to a Nebraska football game.  My daughter is going to college in Lincoln.  So my first experience was Parent Weekend in 2014.  The stadium was wonderful.  But go to the game and it is beyond wonderful.  Even though we lost the game the experience and the fans make it totally worth it!  I have never had so much fun.  You have to experience the SEA OF RED!  The spirit.... WONDERFUL TIMES"
4400,Date of experience: September 2015,15-Dec-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Go Huskers!,You've got to see it on a game day for a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The sea of red and volume of cheers only happen like this in Nebraska.

I'm a die hard Husker fan living in Texas, it's rough! Last game of the 2015 season and it was FREEZING! The entry was smooth, sections are marked well, and the other fans were really friendly.  This experience was a great one!!  We'll be back, hopefully when it's warmer! haha"
4404,Date of experience: November 2015,30-Nov-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,3,Old stadium,"I'm glad I saw a game here, but will never go back. We arrived at our gate 20 minutes before kickoff, but could only get seated with about three minutes gone in the game. They have too narrow of isles which creates the bottleneck. Great atmosphere and a really neat looking old stadium, but needs modification."
4405,Date of experience: November 2015,28-Nov-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Incredible,This stadium is state of the art.  Nebraska has built a reputation of excellence and you will feel every bit of that when you are here.

4407,Date of experience: November 2015,19-Nov-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,Cornhusker Country,Memorial Stadium on the University of Nebraska is the first landmark you see on the way into Lincoln.

It's huge, loads of history in the building, and if you get the chance to check out a game, it's the best experience you'll have hands down. A lot of people who have visited Lincoln and had the chance to check out a game will tell you the same. I actually went to a game in the year of 2013, but Trip Advisor wouldn't let me go that far back. I was lucky enough to go with some individuals from work and they had a great time too as it was their first Husker game."
4413,Date of experience: November 2015,9-Nov-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Go Big RED!!,We love the games!! There is always excitement in the crowd.  Some games are full of heartbreak and some full of shock!  We love our boys in red either way and always enjoy our Husker game days!
4414,Date of experience: October 2015,6-Nov-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,A must-see for college football fans,"If you enjoy college football, there are few places better than Memorial Stadium.  Every game has been sold out since 1962 (get your tickets early!) and the fans pack the stadium for a great environment.  The Tunnel Walk when the players enter the field is something you'll never forget - it gives me chills to watch.  The tailgating before the game is pretty spread out and parking can be difficult.  If you don't have a spot already, it's usually easy to get a spot in the Indian Center, which allows you to pay cash to park and you can tailgate on your own.  Otherwise, the designated stadium parking requires a pass."
4415,Date of experience: October 2015,4-Nov-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,GBR!,"Memorial Stadium is just neato.  I try to go to a game once a year with my father, and there really is no beating the in-person experience. All the seats are pretty great, from endzone to 50 yard line.  I was particularly impressed with the 600 levels which I tried for the first time this year.  It was impossible to see the numbers on the alternate jerseys for the Northwestern game (thanks, Adidas), but you can really get a great view of each & every play up there.The stairs can be a little steep, so be mindful of that.  If you are older or have leg problems be wary.  I also have had a couple instances where they have sold out of Runza's and/or pizza at half time or in the third quarter.  So if you plan to buy food, it's better to get it earlier than later.The fans are so nice it's creepy, so any fans of opposing teams will feel safe & comfortable in the fold.Go Big Red!"
4416,Date of experience: September 2015,3-Nov-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Big Red,The excitement in this stadium on Saturday is most electrifying to say the least. Ninety thousand people dressed in red holding balloons to be released on the first touchdown is a sight to behold.
4417,Date of experience: October 2015,26-Oct-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,College Football Temple,"If you enjoy college sports this is a great place to visit at some point. Despite what you hear, tickets are usually available, and all of the seats are good. Fans are just great, team is hit and miss."
4418,Date of experience: October 2015,26-Oct-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Felt right at home my first time,"The best thing about Memorial Stadium in Lincoln, Nebraska are the Nebraska fans.  Which is saying something because the stadium itself is great. The stadium seating is pretty steep which can unnerve some people but it also means you're not that far from the action.  We sat at the back of section 7 which, while you get a great view of the game, you don't see much of the stadium due to the overhang from the upper deck.  I'd recommend either the upper deck or low enough in the lower deck so that you can see the stadium (though I imagine the overhang is appreciated when it is raining). You can't really walk from section to section in the seating area (at least not on our side of the stadium) because they designed it with very few aisles so as to maximize the number of seats.  I had two items to eat.  I think it is State law that you have to eat a Runza at the game which was fine with me.  A Runza is a bun stuffed with ground beef, cabbage and spices - pretty tasty. I also had their pizza (Valentino's). Wasn't as impressed with that but being from Chicago I'm a bit of a pizza snob.  I thought it tasted like Pizza Hut. Which, if you like Pizza Hut, is fine.Just a word or two about the Nebraska fans.  I have never felt more welcomed as a visiting fan. Whenever I wore my Purple, which I did pretty much all the time, people kept coming up to me and welcoming me to Lincoln and saying that they hoped I enjoyed the game. They would offer advice on restaurants and things to do in Lincoln and would ask about the Wildcats and were always happy to talk about their beloved Cornhuskers.Gotta give Nebraska an A+ for game day experience!"
4419,Date of experience: October 2015,25-Oct-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Great experience,"It has been a few years since I made it to a Husker game, but it was as I remembered: Awesome! Very friendly staff if you have any questions. And they rent comfortable stadium seats for $5/so you don't have to bother bringing any or be uncomfortable. Great fans and always a wonderful experience!"
4420,Date of experience: October 2015,24-Oct-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Fun experience even for an outsider.,"My husband is a Nebraska fan and finally got me to a game.  Despite coming from Colorado, it was a blast!"
4421,Date of experience: November 2014,22-Oct-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,A true college game experience,"Husker game day provides a true college game experience. The great crowds are trying to will their red clad team to victory. The faithful 90K+ are known for their sportsmanlike attitudes. While there is serious tailgating throughout downtown Lincoln, alcoholic abuse very seldom mars the experience. I've been to games at USC, Colorado, Miami and the Big 10 Championships - all have been negative experiences due to poor fans. At Virginia Tech I had positive experiences, much like Memorial Stadium.SEATING TIP: Avoid seats in the northeast corner, as the legroom is all but non-existent in this section of the bowl."
4422,Date of experience: October 2015,21-Oct-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,Lincoln people are GREAT!!,"Unbelievable.   The fans and residents of Lincoln were very helpful and friendly, even after Wisconsin pulled off a victory in a very ugly football game.   We will be returning in 2 years, mainly because of the people and hospitality we experienced."
4423,Date of experience: October 2015,20-Oct-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Go Big Red!,"Great stadium to watch a football game.  If you're in the end zones, don't wait until the last minute to arrive or you will miss the kickoff.  In fact, make sure you're in your seats 10+ minutes before the game to watch the tunnel walk, it will get you fired up!"

4425,Date of experience: October 2015,15-Oct-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Big Red!,"The stadium is huge, recently remodeled, added more seating and holds the record for consecutive sell outs.  The fans of Nebraska college football are great.  The sea of red colors in the stadium is something everyone should see at least once.  Go early to the game to enjoy all there is to do and see all the tailgaters and vendors."

Great facility & well managed flow.  And seriously, watching the Cornhusker Marching Band is wonderful especially given the free access to the stadium to watch the early morning rehearsal prior to the home games and the CMB marching to and from the stadium before and after each home game."
4429,Date of experience: September 2015,1-Oct-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,3,Short visit.,If you are near here it is worth a few minutes to walk around. The statues are fun to see. You can feel the pride and history.
4430,Date of experience: September 2015,28-Sep-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Football experience at it's best in the heartland,We had never been to Lincoln or obviously the stadium. It was an awesome experience. The venue is older but didn't seem so and the staff was very friendly as were the fans. The PA system is the loudest I have ever heard (and we are from the SEC). There are plenty of sky boxes and all the regular seats have adequate room (Unlike at Tennessee where they are too tight together). If you have a chance go see the Huskers play your favorite team and soak up the history and hospitality of the Husker fans.
4431,Date of experience: September 2015,28-Sep-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,great football,I went to a NE football game and it was a great atmosphere - one of the best in the country.  The area is very friendly and the people are the best fans you could ask for.

Parking can be a challenge so scout the area and plan ahead.   Get to the stadium early enough to rent a seat back, as most seats are simple bench."
4434,Date of experience: September 2015,27-Sep-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Game Day Atmosphere!,The game day atmosphere for Husker football is always electric.  The stadium is laid out and well organized.  The staff does a good job of moving large masses of people.  I recommend you go early or be prepared to deal with the crowds and delays.
4435,Date of experience: September 2015,27-Sep-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,I just keep going back.,Simply the greatest place to see a college football game. Friendly people and decent accommodations.
4436,Date of experience: September 2015,26-Sep-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,First Game Day Experience,Just a great experience to have. It's no wonder that Memorial Stadium is the biggest city in NE on game day. Had a great time with hubby and kids.
4437,Date of experience: September 2015,24-Sep-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,3,Game Day,"The atmosphere in and around memorial stadium is electric on game days. The crowds are so excited to see their team on game days.  The food selection can be better, nasty cold valentine's, the runzas are good, as well as the hotdogs are your choices to eat."
4438,Date of experience: September 2015,18-Sep-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Husker Heaven,"There is no place like Nebraska and nothing personifies that more than Memorial stadium. The crowd at Nebraska games takes pride in being some of the friendliest and sporting people in college football. While, they may have the occasional Idiot fan, it's not unusual for the other Nebraska faithful to pit him or her in their place. Cheering the opposition as they leave the field, winners or losers me is something that WILL happen, guaranteed. Nebraksa football is as close to heaven as you will ever get"
4439,Date of experience: September 2015,15-Sep-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Great football venue!,"Get here early as the tail gating begins early and is everywhere. Parking is best at one of the parking garages for $20 and take their shuttle to the stadium. The crowds in UN red were very courteous to this guy in BYU blue. It's great that no alchohol is allowed inside the stadium. Again, the people were warm and friendly to this visitor. And it was a great place to watch a football game with 90,000 of your closest friends. Loved the outcome for BYU and still the crowds were good sports."
4440,Date of experience: September 2015,13-Sep-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,Amazing atmosphere,"We attended our first Husker games & had an amazing time. The people all around us were awesome & helpful. The seat back chairs are a must & worth the $5 rental.  My husband & I are both tall (I'm 5'10'' & he's 6'4'') & that makes for your knees touching the people in front of you, but again well worth being able to see the game here."
4441,Date of experience: November 2014,11-Sep-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Go Big Red,Great experience to watch quality football. Great fans and good times had by all. Highly recommend this stadium for true sports fans.
4442,Date of experience: September 2015,10-Sep-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Nicest fanbase of anywhere I have visited.,"Attended the BYU cornhusker game and the Nebraska fans could not have been nicer both before the game and after the game. We parked our car nearly a mile from the stadium and our hike to the game was one constant offer to eat and drink by Husker fans. After the game a loss to the home town fans, they continued to offer food and drink and express appreciation that we came to town. Great venue, great fans great time."
4443,Date of experience: September 2015,9-Sep-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Go Big Red,"You have to go to a football game when in Lincoln. If it's not a possibility just walk around the stadium and campus, it's worth your time."
4444,Date of experience: September 2015,9-Sep-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,"Impressive venue, terrific fans","As an opposing team visitor, I was impressed by the Husker fans, facilities, and game-day experience.Pretty cool to hang with nearly 90,000 other fans, enjoying football, great weather and wimmer's hot dogs.The stadium is very well-maintained, clean and raucous when the crowd is in it.Get yourself a red hot dog and enjoy!"
4445,Date of experience: September 2015,9-Sep-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,When full it's the 3rd biggest city in Nebraska,"It's a football stadium.  It's a big football stadium, the sculpture outside are worth seeing - - especially if it's not game day.  On game day you only know the sculptures are there because the crowds have to walk around them."
4446,Date of experience: September 2015,9-Sep-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Impressive Venue,"I didn't get to experience the thrill of a game there but made time to job by on an evening run.  The proximity to the downtown/Haymarket area lends itself to a full day/evening experience.  A well designed stadium that allows for the efficient accommodation of huge crowds, it also magnifies excitement!  Despite being an SEC fan, this storied stadium demands respect!"
4447,Date of experience: September 2015,7-Sep-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,One Of A Kind Experience,If your a Husker fan there is nothing like Memorial Stadium on game day. The energy is unbelievable and starts downtown. Live football is so different than watching it on TV. All the fan chants and doing the wave just adds to the experience. Great fun for a family.
4448,Date of experience: September 2015,7-Sep-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Great Football Venue!,Fantastic Football Venue!  Fans are awesome!  The atmosphere is exciting.  Go Big Red!  The media elements are well done!

4450,Date of experience: September 2015,6-Sep-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Must See,"Anyone who remotely likes college football needs to make the trip. It doesn't matter if your team wins or loses, you will enjoy your time.The fans are extremely gracious. I had so many people shake my hand I felt like I was running for President."
4451,Date of experience: November 2014,2-Sep-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,GO BIG RED,Theres no place like Nebraska.  Memorial stadium has an energy on game days that is gound no where elsr. Enjoy a runza and valentinos.
4452,Date of experience: September 2015,2-Sep-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,A Visual Wow for Any Sports Fan,"I attended Nebraska in the late 70's. The stadium was known and massive then.  The additions, the updates, the new size and mega-structure now is worth a walkabout.  While still maintaining the 'Tradition' of Nebraska football, the place simply shouts 'best football venue in America!'"
4453,Date of experience: October 2014,1-Sep-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Go Big Red!,No better place to see a football game! The fans are the best. And be sure to try one of the signature Weimer hot dogs.
4454,Date of experience: September 2014,30-Aug-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,No place like Nebraska,Great Place to see a football game. Best fans in College Football and a must stop for in the fall in Lincoln.
4456,Date of experience: November 2014,23-Aug-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Greatest football fans!,"Their motto says ""Through these gates, pass the greatest fans in college football""  It is entirely true. The friendliest,warmest people you will encounter! I write this as an out of state fan! We love Lincoln NE"
4457,Date of experience: August 2015,19-Aug-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,A Fun Place to Visit,This is such an iconic place for someone who spent many years in Lincoln.  Loved seeing the updates to the stadium and the new entrance complete with the statue of Bob Devaney.
4458,Date of experience: September 2014,13-Aug-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,3,She's a grand old stadium,"While I was born and raised a Cornhusker, you have to call out Memorial Stadium for what she is.  An aging stadium.  Unless you have one of the fancy skyboxes, you're sitting on metal bleachers.  And that can get old when you're crammed together and the team isn't playing well.  But for atmosphere and tradition, it's hard to beat the entire experience.  That would be above average.  But when I'm rating the stadium itself, the stadium has charm but few comforts."
4459,Date of experience: November 2014,13-Aug-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,A Nebraska landmark,A visit to nebraska isn't complete without a Huskers football game. The stadium features the hall of champions where national championship trophies are displayed. Arrive early and walk to the stadium with the marching band.
4460,Date of experience: September 2014,1-Aug-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,3,"People in state love it, but nothing impressive","People from Nebraska will rave about the stadium, but to me (someone from the NYC area on the east coast), there was nothing impressive about it. Average stadium."
4461,Date of experience: October 2014,31-Jul-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,for a Nebraska football game,got there early tailgating was good got in just in time to see the band take the field people were nice food was ok football game was awesome
4462,Date of experience: November 2014,31-Jul-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,Football,"If you have never been to a Nebraska Cornhuskers home game, you should make sure it is on your bucket list.  Even my Dad who lived in Texas (Football is king) was amazed and awed at being at the game.  Every seat is always full and it is a sea of red.  Expect chills when Nebraska comes out of the tunnel.  I will admit that the seats are not comfortable and recommend renting or bringing a stadium seat just so you have enough room for your seat."
4464,Date of experience: August 2014,24-Jul-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Huskers Season opener,Another sold out game for Nebraska Cornhusker football. No other place I'd rather be than with 95000 friends rooting for the home team. Awesome sea of red. There is no place like Nebraska!
4465,Date of experience: October 2014,15-Jul-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Memorial Stadium,Everyone should experience the stadium on a home game day!  The atmosphere is something you have to experience at least once in your life if you are from Nebraska and love the Huskers.
4468,Date of experience: October 2014,8-Jul-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,"Game Day in Lincoln, NE","Ok, ok, so the stadium has been soldout for over 1/2 a century, a  span of 340 consecutive games, yeah, yeah. You can still get a game ticket. Bring some $$$ with you and be ready to deal with scalpers. Just ask, and you will be able to find out where a seat is located w/i the stadium. Just talk to the scalpers and tell them you will pay so much for a ticket, and if thats lower than they will accept, you give the ticket back to them and walk away to someone else, and do that again until you get someone who will accept the $$$ amount you are willing to pay. Be sure to be in your seat about 15 minutes before game time, so you dont miss "" The Tunnel Walk."" That is an exciting thing to behold. It sends a chill down my spine every time I see it, about 24x. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLlxi90oMYJust to see the ""Sea of Red"" is amazing. At the top of every gate into the stadium is the phrase, ""Through These Gates Pass the Greatest Fans in College Football."" It has been commented by game announcers that Nebraska football fans are some of the most respectful fans in the country. When the opposing team wins, most fans will stand and clap as the opponent walks off the field victorious. I know, I have been there and done that. Put Nebraska football and ""The Tunnel Walk"" on your to do list in life.   After the game, once the marching band goes through there routine and leaves the field, fans are allowed to go onto the field for a short period of time, to run around, throw a football around, chat with other fans or just take in the atmosphere of the stadium."
4469,Date of experience: September 2014,8-Jul-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Memorial stadium,"One of best times for football!)). If you are into tailgating, getting excited about college football, it is one of the best times and good people to talk with. The stadium also boasts a memory room, museum from past times of sports with the state! The stadium just went through some renovations and upgrades."
4477,Date of experience: November 2014,13-May-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Awesome stadium,We love going to the Nebraska football games here when we get a chance. All of the Nebraska fans are friendly and welcoming to opposing teams. Food is reasonable and parking affordable.
4481,Date of experience: August 2014,18-Mar-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Historic Stadium,"Memorial Stadium in Lincoln, Nebraska is hands down one of the best college football stadium around. Its doesn't matter what team you are cheering for. In the eyes of the fans in nebraska its doesn't matter and i don't think you can meet better ones.  Go big Red!"
4482,Date of experience: January 2015,10-Mar-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,"Historic, Loud, Friendly","Nice to visit on a Minnesota Gopher football win, which is rare here. Surrounding Hay Market area totally revitalized fun, safe with many great food choices.  Make this a day event! Seating for visitors is cramped in steep in corner and long walk to bathrooms. Nebraska fans are very nice as well"
4483,Date of experience: September 2014,8-Mar-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Go Big Red!!,If you go anywhere in your life time this is one of the most important places if you're a Husker fan!  Memorial Stadium becomes its own city on game day.  Location is perfect and the games are always good when you in the action!  Huskers rule!!
4484,Date of experience: September 2014,4-Mar-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,this place is huge,"No parking unless  you get there a day early to tailgate. To get there, chances are lots of traffic. We used Lyft to make it there. Parking is hard to find downtown, parking lots get full fast. There's lots of walking no matter what. Full of energy, for most part people are friendly. Personally, i hated it, I don't like sweaty people and claustrophobic. I'd rather be at home watching the game in my tv and my couch. But the hubby loves it, the atmosphere. It's great really - just not for me. I  went back by the concessions and watched the game from one of the flat screens. The restrooms were clean, lots of concession stands for you to choose from. Recent WiFi addition was wonderful."
4485,Date of experience: September 2014,22-Feb-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Nebraska's third largest city,When this stadium is full it is Nebraska's third largest city.  Around 300 continuous sellouts makes this an unforgettable memory. The ambience is electrifying at every game. Have a look you wont be sorry.
4486,Date of experience: November 2014,8-Jan-15,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,if you love the huskers,"you gotta go see a game here, yeah the concourse is a little antiquated and its hard to get to your seat sometime but theres no place like it.  been a couple dozen times over the years, and its always fun, especially the tailgating.  it IS true that the fans are friendly to everyone, friend or foe."
4487,Date of experience: January 2014,12-Dec-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,The Cornhuskers know football,"Wow, the remodel of this place is fantastic and it wasn't too shabby to begin with. It was not football season when we visited so I can only imagine what it must be like on game day with that sea of red filling that beautiful stadium. The glory days may be gone but don't try telling that to the Nebraska faithful."
4488,Date of experience: November 2014,3-Dec-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Always a great experience,"Have been to many football games at Memorial Stadium.  The most recent was the Minnesota v. Nebraska game.  The atmosphere is so much fun and everyone is so friendly.  There is lots of tailgating before the game on the campus.  While in the stadium for the game everyone is having fun. Seating is a little cramped but you end up standing most of the time anyway.  Always, always fun!!!!  On game day Memorial Stadium becomes the third largest city in the State of Nebraska.  Everything just stops in Lincoln on game day.  This is a must see especially on game day!!  Have to experience it to believe it.  Also, walk around the University of Nebraska-Lincoln campus.  It is really beautiful."
4489,Date of experience: November 2014,27-Nov-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,3,Chaotic but fun!,"Went to the Cornhuskers vs. Minnesota Gophers.  Nebraska lost the game but it was fun. Seating in the stadium is very tight and uncomfortable. People there push their way through; that was annoying.  Prices for food were not too bad!  Then the walk on the campus of UNL to the stadium; a chaotic nightmare.  Cleanliness is apparently not a top priority!Overall, it was fun and have a fairly good time!"
4490,Date of experience: November 2014,24-Nov-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,LOVE,"Memorial Stadium was amazing! We went to the Husker game this past weekend and had an absolute blast. Not only are Husker fans amazing, the place was ultimately spectacular. This is what Nebraska is about."
4491,Date of experience: October 2014,20-Nov-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,The Greatest Fans in College Football,"This is one of those places that you truly have to see before you die. Experiencing Memorial Stadium on a Husker game day is few and far between. From the ""Husker Power"" chant, to the infamous bone-chilling Tunnel Walk, to finally being part of the ""Sea of Red."" This is a bucket list item you want to cross off sooner than later, because once you experience it for yourself, you won't want to miss another game."
4492,Date of experience: October 2014,14-Nov-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,A Mecca for college football fans,"I have yet to meet a fan who doesn't enjoy seeing a game here.  It's simply the best place in the country to watch football.   Stadium is great, but the fans are even better."
4493,Date of experience: September 2014,11-Nov-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,It's big!!,"Being a recent transplant to Nebraska I haven't actually been inside the stadium yet, but have driven right by it several times already. I was invited to the game vs Illinois but it was a last-minute invitation and had to decline for a previous appointment I couldn't get out of. Hopefully I will be able to see a Husker game next season though. Looks like a pretty cool stadium!"
4494,Date of experience: November 2014,7-Nov-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Good clean fun,"This was one of the best behaved crowds for a major sporting event I have witnessed. Good fun for the whole family if you can get tickets at a reasonable price. Plus the Husker's won making the crowd even more agreeable. Parking was not too difficult, and finding our seats was easy. Fine place for a game."
4495,Date of experience: November 2014,5-Nov-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Nicest Fans I've Ever Seen.,"I've been to most of the Big 10 stadiums for a game.  Husker fans are easily the nicest fans I've ever seen.  They want to know where you're from.  They want to make sure you're having fun.  They're like a host at a big party who comes by to make sure you're having fun despite the fact you hardly know anyone.  I wish more fans were like them.The stadium itself is quite large.  To get to our seats in the upper atmosphere you have to walk up a series of ramps.  The downside is all the infrastructure such as concessions and bathrooms are on the ground level.  It's a bit of a hike to get down to them at halftime.  At least it was that way for the endzone seats.  Perhaps the seats along the sidelines are different.Cornhusker fans have lots of tradition.  Release red balloons for the first touchdown.  A very large and high quality marching band.  The scoreboard is large and easy to see.  If you ever have a chance to see a game at Memorial Stadium do so.  I hated the game as my team lost, but I loved the time I was there."
4496,Date of experience: September 2014,5-Nov-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Cornhusker mecca,"Experience it!   Where legends are created, history is made and tradition lives on.   On any given football Saturday....the sea of Red is a spectacle to behold....mere words cannot describe it."
4497,Date of experience: October 2014,3-Nov-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,The Cathedral of College Football,"I loved the game day atmosphere in Lincoln and at the stadium.  The Huskers fans are the most cordial and gracious fans I have ever met.  Really appreciated their tradition of applauding the opposing team as they left the field--really classy.  Didn't know about sending up balloons after the first score--really cool.  The best advice I got before the game was to rent a cushion for $5.  Apparently Memorial stadium seating space was measured for Victoria Secret models!  By renting a cushion, I was able to claim a bit more space for my wide bottom!"
4498,Date of experience: October 2014,3-Nov-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Football tradition at its best,"This 90,000 plus stadium rocks big time on game day Saturdays and the Husker faithful are out in full red force. A gameday venue to experience."
4499,Date of experience: October 2014,31-Oct-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Fun first experience,"Though my husband and I went to other Big10 Universities - my son has decided that Nebraska is the ""cooler"" team, so we made a family trip.   We were treated great in the tailgating lot, invited to share in the other reveler's breakfasts.  The stadium is quite impressive at over 90K capacity.   there were fireworks and balloons for the touchdowns, and the view from our endzone seats was quite good.  Fans were very friendly, and focused on the game - without being too ""intense"" for my little boy!  I would definitely seize the chance to attend a game here again."
4500,Date of experience: October 2014,31-Oct-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Football,being a student at UNL i got student tickets for football and i enjoy the atmosphere of the stadium.
4501,Date of experience: September 2014,30-Oct-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Great Experience,"Having been to stadiums elsewhere, Memorial Stadium is just unbeatable. It is a huge stadium filled with a sea of red and roaring energy. It is easy to get to and is surrounded by a lot of fantastic hotels and restaurants. I may be biased but the friends are always very friendly. A Husker game day is what I would be most proud to show an incoming Nebraska visitor."
4502,Date of experience: October 2014,27-Oct-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Best place to see a game,"I have been to a lot of places for college football and Memorial Stadium in Lincoln is the best so far. The people couldn't be nicer to all of us visitors, and watching the game was like going back in time with all the tradition."
4503,Date of experience: October 2014,27-Oct-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Great Experience,Easy to get to. Dislike the heavy traffic with long traffic lines. Good view. Good food along the way and at the Stadium

4506,Date of experience: September 2014,29-Sep-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,GO HUSKERS!!!,"This was only my second time there and can't wait to go back. If you don't like walking I advise you to get there way early so you don't have to walk several blocks. Didn't bother us but we also stopped at one of the restaurants on the way back to our car. Crowd was great, people working there very helpful and kind. Great experience."
4507,Date of experience: September 2014,23-Sep-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Game Day 2nd to None,"Even if you aren't a University of Nebraska Cornhusker football fan, this is a place for college football fans to visit. It is one of the best college football venues in the country! GO BIG RED!"
4508,Date of experience: September 2014,21-Sep-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Wow!,No place like Memorial Stadium on game day.  Especially when Miami is in town. It was loud. It was great football under the lights and a huge win for the Huskers.
4510,Date of experience: September 2014,17-Sep-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,a very nice place,"this is the home of Husker football/Huskers.  very nice place.  of course I admit I am a bit partial, as I used to work for the Training Table-a sports eatery, mostly for the athletes and the athletic dept. I think they still serve the public for Lunch, how ever.  eve. meals are only open to athletes and staff.  good food here.  the stadium has some good game food, lots of hot dogs."
4511,Date of experience: September 2014,16-Sep-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Go Big Red,"And if you are lucky to get game tickets even better, with 91,000 people in red this is the place to be for the 7 saturdays a year when it's game day.  The rest of the year, it is a pretty historic structure to check out.  And you can see the trophy room with the Bowl Trophies and National Champions trophys,  Check out the statues outside as well as the old exterior hidden within."
4512,Date of experience: August 2014,6-Sep-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,We Found The Cornhuskers!!!!,"If you have never been to Lincoln, Nebraska, you have to go Memorial Stadium and look for a Cornhusker!!  The football team was practicing so we can now say we saw the Cornhuskers!!!  The campus is huge and well worth the time to drive around the area."
4514,Date of experience: September 2014,2-Sep-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Go BIG RED!!,"I love this stadium! I have gone to several professional and college stadiums but this is a grand old building with all the modern toys! They has increased the capacity to over 90,000 now and there is great views from any seat in the house!"
4516,Date of experience: October 2013,2-Sep-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Great place,great place to watch the games. Home or away. great people and a fantastic venue. the stadium is perfect.
4517,Date of experience: October 2013,22-Aug-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,4,Best place to watch in the whole world,Cornhusker are my team and I have spent many a Saturday watching them play. The stadium is electric and there is never any tolerance for bad behavior that is just not the Nebraska way.
4518,Date of experience: August 2014,19-Aug-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Go Big Red!,"Best place to see the Huskers play.  Redone seats, great tailgating, fun place to hang, fun, fun, fun!"
4520,Date of experience: August 2014,7-Aug-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,3,Quick stop at a college football icon,"I am not a Cornhusker fan, but am a college football fan, so when I was in Lincoln, I wanted to see Memorial Stadium,  It was a Saturday afternoon in early August, so there was no access inside the stadium.  There are a few statues outside the stadium honoring Coach Osborne and the national championship teams.  At least now when I watch a game on tv being played in Memorial Stadium, I'll have a better idea of what it is like."
4521,Date of experience: September 2013,30-Jul-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Game day...,This place is insane and a must see for any Husker Fan. The Sea of Red is breath taking. Oh yeah...its gets pretty loud if you have sensitive ears.  I'd say its the funnest place to be in the whole state of Nebraska.
4522,Date of experience: September 2013,20-Jun-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,GO BIG RED!,What is there to dislike about Memorial Stadium?  Duh!  The only thing to make it even better woudl be cushioned and cheaper seats!  :)
4525,Date of experience: September 2013,8-May-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,no better place for college football that right here,"The Nebraska  fans are the greatest. They treat the visiting team as guests not enemies like in some college stadiums. The stadium has been sold out for over 30 years and now seats over 90,000 football fans."
4527,Date of experience: November 2013,5-May-14,Big Ten,Nebraska,5,Amazing!,"As season ticket holders, we love Memorial Stadium!  It's Big, it's Loud, it's Historic!  We talk with so many people from opposing teams and they tell us how great the stadium is and how friendly and courteous the Husker fans are to everyone.  Attending a game here is a memorable experience that any football fan would appreciate.  We love that it is non smoking and that alcohol is not sold inside the stadium!  The staff does their best to keep the facility clean and safe.  There are several good food vendors, but like all stadiums, it is pricey and they have little to offer vegetarians.  We used earplugs and noise canceling head phones when our son was small because the noise volume is crazy!  We have seen it 110* inside the stadium and also frigid cold and snow, so check the weather and dress in layers; don't forget the sunscreen.  If you are claustrophobic, you might want to avoid entering the stadium and watching the game on the huge screen at the outdoor practice field.  They also set up fun activities for kids on the practice field several hours prior to the game.  Don't miss the Heisman trophy room!"

In an effort to extract more and more money from their fans, the university has crammed the seats so close both horizontally and vertically that you are bound to have a knee in your back.   I kind of pity the folks who are going to every game to keep the sell-out streak alive.  Don't tell them that they are missing a way better experience by staying home!   Once a year is plenty."

4539,Date of experience: October 2013,7-Oct-13,Big Ten,Nebraska,2,Spend a few bucks to upgrade facilities.,"After hearing of the millions spent upgrading the facilities here I would have hoped that the bathrooms would be more than a few common cattle troughs and easier to get to.    The logistics of getting in and out of your seat to go to concessions are terrible this is a really bad design, maybe they should have consulted a good architecture school when they built it.  Oh yes, when you are walking down a ramp under the stands  the spilled drinks of the people above you can rain down and drench you , so be ready to move like an I-back to avoid that.   The concessions are few and far between with few choices and it appears that they want  you to purchase a plain hotdog or a 'Runza'  or a slice of something from Valentino's that they called ' Pizza'  from a kid with a box of them that is usually empty - if it is halftime. I am wondering if all the good food and drinks are in the skyboxes with the big spenders? The seating is made for people under  5 foot 10 and less than 160 pounds.   You get jammed into a bleacher by the old folks in front of you with rental seats and the knees of the people in back of you in your back.  If you plan on going with someone else, buy 3 seats and leave the third empty then you will just have close seating.  Wear knee pads for the chair back in front of you.  If you like the feeling of a train car headed to Auschwitz, you will love this place ( except everyone is in red ). The best part of a football game here are the people and the play on the field,  both are top notch - but they are not the facility.  Its been 20 years since I was there and I dont plan on going back - unless maybe I can score a skybox seat where the big donors sip booze, eat steaks and are separate from the crowd..."

The stadium was just enlarged & there were over 91,000 fans watching the home opener. With the extra large video screen it is easy to see the action. As expected the upper level seats are a long way from the field. The Nebraska fans are very nice to the opposing teams. Arrive early to enjoy the different restaurants & sports bars. Many of them have live bands. Their are lots of fans tailgating & it's not uncommon for those tailgaters to invite other fans to join them. It's fun to walk around the outside of the stadium also. Spend the extra 5 bucks for a portable seat cushion with a back. Then you are guaranteed your 19"" of seat space as all the seats are a tight fit with little legroom. Arrive to your seats 15 minuets early to see & hear the tunnel walk when the team comes onto the field to start the game."

If you are on the opposing team's fans you'll be treated well.  The fans know when to stand, when to cheer and when to sit down."
4571,Date of experience: October 2021,21-Oct-21,Big Ten,Northwestern,5,Recalling the glory days,"Do you remember when Northwestern's football team was ranked No. 2 in the nation for five weeks in a row? That was in 1959. I was a student at the University of Illinois but my father, a graduate of Northwestern's dental school, had tickets for Northwestern's season opener against perennial national power Oklahoma. The Wildcats were ranked No. 10 nationally but catapulted to No. 2 after crushing the Sooners 45-13. For the next five weeks, coach Ara Parseghian's team ranked No. 2 in the nation until losing its last three games. Northwestern drew home crowds of 56,061 in a victory over Minnesota and 62,964 in a loss to Wisconsin. That was then and this is now. At the time it was constructed in 1926, at 1501 Central Street in Evanston, a Chicago suburb, Dyche Stadium was considered one of the finest college football stadiums in the country. It consists of two semi-circular grandstands on either sideline, with the west or home sideline having a small, curved upper deck, maximizing the number of fans sitting close to the playing field. Today, it is named Ryan Field in honor of the family of Aon Corporation founder Patrick Ryan, a former chairman of Northwestern's board of trustees who has donated millions of dollars to the university. Ryan has spearheaded a drive to improve the overall athletic facilities. Despite its pleasant surroundings, Ryan Field remains the only Power 5 Conference stadium without permanent lighting and its capacity of 47,130 is the smallest in the Big Ten."

The staff are very helpful friendly and knowledgeable. The food concessions are plentiful and offer solid variety. The Northwestern band is tremendous. The field is in super condition. It is a traditional old stadium with plenty of charm. Attend!!!
4577,Date of experience: October 2019,19-Oct-19,Big Ten,Northwestern,5,Super fun,Visited for the Ohio State football game. It was a blast. The ladies rooms were not super packed. In and out fairly quickly. Very clean and plenty of people to help. Very well organized. Had a great time!
4578,Date of experience: October 2018,24-Sep-19,Big Ten,Northwestern,5,Great fun,"Went to a Wildcats game and had a great afternoon. Good sight lines anywhere in the stadium and it??s intimate so you get the feel of the crowd. NU students are a feisty bunch, without being obnoxious. Lots of fun."

Great parking near the stadium with shuttle buses that take you right to the entrance and all are free. Lots of concession stands inside to move the patrons along quickly.  Plenty of ushers to assist the fans and the view from the stands is good."
4580,Date of experience: September 2019,19-Sep-19,Big Ten,Northwestern,4,Not bad at all,"Went to see unlv vs northwestern and it was a good experience. I enjoyed the vintage feel of the stadium. The only real draw back was the bench style seating! After an hour your back starts to hurt. Rent the seat back if you can. The other draw back was no alcohol it would of gotten 5 stars if it had alcohol. Overall nice venue for a college game nice home fans, vintage,feel cheap and clean!"
4581,Date of experience: September 2018,22-Jul-19,Big Ten,Northwestern,3,Good venue albeit unusual,"Northwestern does not have a good football crowd, particularly when school is not in session.  The stadium is unusually designed with the towers on the home side, and a  more high-school like visitor size.  Concessions are located under the stands but include Chicago stereotypes.  There is no on-site parking if you are not a season ticket holder."
4583,Date of experience: October 2018,2-Jul-19,Big Ten,Northwestern,3,Classic Field for Big 10 Football,"A throwback to Fall College Football. In the heart of the city, mostly walk-able.

4585,Date of experience: November 2018,31-Dec-18,Big Ten,Northwestern,4,Old stadium with great tailgate action!,"Ryan Field is one of those cold, old concrete stadiums that can never be fully renovated. It is easy to park nearby and quick to enter at any gate. The tailgates in the East and West Lots are among the best I have ever seen at any college. The seats are cold, backless, hard aluminum benches , unless the ticket-holder has  paid for soft seatbacks to be installed.  The sightlines are best if you are up high. Bring binocs.  The food service is mediocre at best; very few healthy choices. The ushers are laid-back and will help you find your seats. All in all, this is a  much nicer old concrete stadium than those at Illinois, Notre Dame, and Harvard that I have been to."
4586,Date of experience: November 2018,8-Nov-18,Big Ten,Northwestern,1,You could die in tunnel,Be warned. They funnel thousands of people into that small tunnel on the south west side in a attempt to kill fans. They think someone being crushed to death is funny. Just a horrid situation there. Malicious attempt to kill people in that tunnel!
4587,Date of experience: November 2018,5-Nov-18,Big Ten,Northwestern,3,"Good, but Not Great...","Going in I've read all sorts of positive and negative things about Ryan Field.  I will try my best to write the most honest review I can from my own experience this past weekend.1) Take an Uber/taxi to stadium.  Parking is free, but the streets are very small and crowded.  Traffic was at a standstill 1 hour before kickoff.  We hopped out about 1/4 mile from stadium and walked.  If you do decide to drive yourself, get there plenty early because there was not alot of parking offered.2) Pay attention to where you enter stadium.  Ryan field is not a complete oval, so you can't easily just walk to other side of the stadium if you enter on the wrong side.  Pay attention to your section on your seats and follow the signs posted by the gates.3) Bathroom situation is a MESS.  Everyone around me would leave and miss almost an entire quarter.  Hold it if you can, if not, be prepared to miss alot of the game.  4) Only 1 jumbo tron in the stadium, and its a weird angle  behind a tower.  This is only visible for 3/4 of stadium.  If you need to see the jumbo-tron, be very careful where you sit.  See my photos for example.5) Take a blanket or seat cushion, your butt will thank you later.Overall we really enjoyed our time.  We sat in section 133 row 1 which was right near the ND band and cheerleaders.  Great view of the stadium.  View of the jumbo tron was greatly restricted.  This stadium has charm, but could definable be improved."
4588,Date of experience: October 2018,28-Oct-18,Big Ten,Northwestern,4,Surprisingly pleasant experience,"I saw NU play in early October and had never been to Ryan Field before. The stadium itself is not super-impressive but it grew on me; it's small enough that it's really easy to get in and out of it, and you can be from the tailgate to the game in minutes. I was there with lots of friends and family and it was easy to move around in the seats to visit with people."
4589,Date of experience: October 2018,27-Oct-18,Big Ten,Northwestern,4,Great place to see a game,"We went during Family Weekend at Northwestern. The school provides shuttles from campus and downtown. The stadium is a great place to see a game. Although the food lines were busy at halftime, they moved quick. The shuttles back were quick and efficient."
4590,Date of experience: October 2018,17-Oct-18,Big Ten,Northwestern,4,Football game,Easy stadium to move around in.  It needs another big screen.  Food was ok and prices were reasonable.  Parking was a mess.
4591,Date of experience: October 2018,14-Oct-18,Big Ten,Northwestern,4,Retro,"Apparently many Big Ten Conference fans only attend games when and where they can get the latest stadium amenities, the biggest crowds, and a long list of food and beverage items at concession stands. That misses the point of going to a stadium to watch your favorite team play football. That's particularly true when traveling to see your team, either home or visiting team.Yes, the stadium is old, small, and has poor concessions. So what? Many fans are close to the action and have great sight lines."
4592,Date of experience: September 2018,9-Oct-18,Big Ten,Northwestern,3,"Well worn, but cozy place to see Big Ten football","I was here for the Michigan v. Northwestern game with my sister, and we were both surprised at how ""intimate"" the place was.  We had great views of the field, and getting in and out was extremely quick and easy.  It was really great hanging out after the game and getting to meet some of the Michigan players too.  That said, the stadium itself could use some upgrades and updates.  It's definitely one of the oldest feeling buildings in the Big Ten.  The fans were really wonderful by the way."
4593,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Oct-18,Big Ten,Northwestern,1,Worst stadium in Big Ten!,"Was there for Michigan at Northwestern game. As a Michigan Alumnus I have traveled to all the original Big Ten Stadiums and State College as well. I have been going to games for Michigan in Evanston for over 25 years. In all that time, no money has been spent at Ryan Field and it shows. From the crumbling and UNSAFE concrete-asphalt pavement on the outside surrounding the stadium, to the UNSAFE conditions under the stands and cow herding mentality of stuffing people trying to get to their seats, the stadium SUCKS and is a major dump! There are high school stadiums in Texas that are larger and better. For a University of it's acclaimed academics and new Ritz Carlton like practice facility on Lake Michigan, the university could spend some money to make this place at least SAFE and somewhat fan friendly. Since over half the fans at the game were Michigan fans, it appears that only the big games are filled in capacity and therefore there is no reason to spend money for the 20,000 Northwestern fans that usually turn out for games. It's truly a shame, Evanston is a gorgeous town on Lake Michigan and it's on the North Side of Chicago so it's suburb in a near urban environment convenient to the ""L"" and train to the LOOP. Fans are pleasant, but the concessions are pre-1970's and the bathrooms take a quarter to access."
4594,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Oct-18,Big Ten,Northwestern,4,"A small, intimate, place to watch a college game","It is tiny.I dont think two men can walk shoulder to shoulder into the stadium - the ramps are that small. The bathroom situation is a mess (long lines for men)The concessions are also backed up.The jumbotron in the stadium was more like a 13 inch trinitron. BUT..This reminded me of West Point's Michie Stadium.Plan and simple this is an old school spot. Aluminum benches, you're close to the action, close to the fiield and close to your neighbors. Stadium is surrounded by tailgaters and for this game the road team, Michigan, seemed to outnumber the home fams 60-40. It smells, feels and looks like college football in America (in the 1950's)A lot of fun, in a great town, near Chicago and just a lovely weekend."
4595,Date of experience: September 2018,30-Sep-18,Big Ten,Northwestern,1,Needs Major Updates,"While the game we attended seemed like a home game (with half the crowd Michigan), as a UM fan I surely would never stake a claim to this dump of a stadium! It appears as if little or no upgrades have happened since this place opened, although the restrooms (what little there were) did have vintage 1980??s push button faucets. This is a shameful High School stadium by most standards.There is no full wrap-around concourse once your ticket is scanned (outside or inside), therefore make sure you pay attention to the section number signs when you enter.Concessions? Oh, they have anything you want to eat ?? as long as it??s a hot dog (we heard about some food court that we couldn??t get to from our ??locked in?? section).Scoreboards? The south-end ??wrapped?? scoreboard was a joke ?? aside from the score, it took half the game to figure out what the numbers represented. The other scoreboard (video) was over our right shoulder and was worthless to our side of the field. And the screechy DJ music played between plays became unbearable by the second half.Finally, somehow we bought seats in the Northwestern players parent section. When I was questioned by a player??s mother (who was clearly inebriated) why we were sitting with them, I pointed out that plenty were available online. She continued to mix Rum and Coke throughout the game, acting like a fool the whole way. Quick Note: apparently you can feel free to bring your spirits and mixers along with you into Ryan Field."
4596,Date of experience: September 2018,21-Sep-18,Big Ten,Northwestern,3,Football Game,"I'll start with the facility itself.  It is old and needs a lot of updates.  The stadium needs to be more enclosed with less capacity.  It also needs a lot more fresh updating to the concourses, a lot more food selection and the capacity to hold lights on their own (they had machines holding up the lights from outside the stadium.)  So the next big sports project might be this.  For the game, it was fun.  There aren't many thrills to the stadium that make it stand out.  The food is okay, not great or bad.  I would expect a lot of changes going forward especially with the recent changes to their athletic facilities elsewhere."
4597,Date of experience: September 2018,17-Sep-18,Big Ten,Northwestern,3,Older facility,"Facility is smaller and older than many and needs some updates.  Interesting to see a Big10 school with portable light towers that are brought in and set up for evening games. Jumbo-tron is low and tucked in corner off to the side and not at end where most stadiums have it. Good views of field from seats.  ??Workers?? were polite and helpful...fans, not as much."
4598,Date of experience: September 2018,15-Sep-18,Big Ten,Northwestern,1,Food is Horrendous,"Granted I don't expect much at a football game, but Ryan Field did not even live up to my low expectations.  The hot dog I ordered was cold (not even luke warm, which would have been acceptable).  It's bad when the ketchup and mustard that one puts on it actually raises the temperature of the hot dog.  The soft pretzel has no salt on it too.  Guess they're trying to save their patrons from high blood pressure.  The pretzel was horrible and the jalapeno cheese you pay for to put on it is terrible too.  The stadium is pretty, which allowed me to give this review one star rather than zero.  A half star is probably more appropriate."
4600,Date of experience: November 2017,27-Jan-18,Big Ten,Northwestern,4,Interesting stadium ?? Too bad it was raining and cold,"Ryan Field is the home of the Northwestern Wildcats football team and is located on the campus of Northwestern University.  This stadium is also located in the town of Evanston, Illinois, about 15 miles directly north of downtown Chicago.  It was easy to visit using public transportation as there is an elevated train station about 2 blocks from it. The stadium was built in 1926 and was originally named Dyche Stadium and was renamed in 1997.I went to the Northwestern versus Minnesota football game on a Saturday morning in mid-November and enjoyed walking around this old and interesting stadium.  The stadium is cool looking and I have never been to one like it. Unfortunately it was raining pretty hard and it was really cold so we were too cold to wonder around very much. Since the weather was bad I was amazed at how empty the seats were (especially at kick off time).  Most of the fans (including us) stayed under the press box overhang that protected the last 20 rows from the rain. The place is old and needs some renovation but I liked the old look. I am happy they generally left the stadium the way it was in the 1920??s and did not rebuild it or replace it with a modern one. The bathrooms need repair but they were heated so that was nice on this cold day.  The Wildcat fans were very friendly towards us even though we were wearing Gopher colors.Overall I enjoyed walking around this interesting old stadium and recommend it (especially if your team is playing).  I plan on going back but will check the weather first and only go on a nice day.  My only complaint was that the TV cameras and supporting scaffolds were right in front of the big scoreboard so we could not see any of the instant replays (fans in other parts of the stadium could see it though)."

4609,Date of experience: November 2016,4-Apr-17,Big Ten,Northwestern,5,Visiting fans are welcome.,"If you're a fan of the visiting team, you're in for a treat.  Tickets are affordable; and you'll be welcome in the eyes of the home team's fans and students, even if you wear your team's colors and/or your team wins.  You can even walk back to your car or into town (downtown Evanston with many fine restaurants is only a mile away) in the company of the home team's fans, and the vast majority of them will say nice things about your team/school.  This is not the case in many other Division 1 football stadiums throughout the country.  Enjoy the game."
4610,Date of experience: October 2016,23-Mar-17,Big Ten,Northwestern,5,"Northwestern, welcome to the 21st century","Northwestern's football and basketball programs have become more competitive and their facilities have become more in tune with the 21st century. When I was a high school student in the 1950s, my father, a Northwestern graduate, gave me tickets to attend a Michigan/Northwestern football game. In those days, crowds were small. It was as if a fan would ask: ""What time is kickoff?"" And the response would be: ""What time can you get here?"" On that day, I arrived an hour before kickoff and was able to park next to the South end zone. Today, that area is reserved for major donors. And there a lot of them. Dyche Stadium was opened in 1926 at 1501 Central Avenue on Northwestern's campus. When constructed, it was considered one of the finest football stadiums in the country with two semi-circular grandstands on either sideline to maximize the number of fans sitting close to the action. But interest in Northwestern's football team declined and so did the crowds despite expansions in 1949 and 1952. Then the alumni, led by AON Corporation founder Patrick Ryan, began to donate millions of dollars for renovations and upgrades. In 1996, Ryan, then chairman of Northwestern's Board of Trustees and a leading contributor, spearheaded a renovation that included new seats, new locker rooms, new restrooms, new concession stands, new weight rooms, new training facilities, a new videoboard that was upgraded from 390 square feet to 1,100 square feet and new ribbon boards at the North and South end zones. Prior to 1997, the 47,130-seat stadium was known as Dyche Stadium in honor of William Dyche, a member of the Class of 1882, former mayor of Evanston and overseer of the original building project. In 1997, it was renamed Ryan Field. The smallest football stadium in the Big 10 Conference, it has an Ivy League appeal, which most Northwestern students and alumni appreciate."
4612,Date of experience: September 2016,26-Oct-16,Big Ten,Northwestern,4,Regular visitor,"Ryan Field offers a fan-friendly old-style Big Ten college football experience.  Yes, there is a modern video scoreboard and many improvements.  It's an old stadium that is easy to navigate.  The fans are friendly.  On game days there is a children's area called Wildcat Alley where you can hang out before kickoff.  You feel comfortable bringing your children to see a game here."
4613,Date of experience: October 2016,25-Oct-16,Big Ten,Northwestern,3,Beautiful scene Sept-Oct; basic amenities; accessibility iffy,"If you have mobility issues Ryan Field can be tricky to navigate.  You must be pro-active to get help with everything from elevator access (to higher seating sections) to getting on ""free"" shuttle buses returning from stadium to parking lots.  An able friend must go to a service window get your ticket stamped "" elevator privileges"" every week.  If you walk with (for example) a cane, the rattling school buses all have different heights for entry and so bottom step may be too high to access since drivers stop in the street -- not at the curb -- to take on passengers.  Over two months of 2016 football, drivers didn't necessarily know their routes and were not always willing to make it easier to get on the bus or to where you needed to be. Parking close to stadium goes to big donors.There are more handrails to high seating at Ryan Field than I've seen at mega-stadium Camp Randall at University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Women's bathrooms have leaks around  windows ignored for years; on a cold day tho' the restrooms are often places with decent heat where you can get warm.On a nice day there is a wonderful view across Evanston and Wilmette, green trees turn color and games can be seen well from high seats in this modestly-sized stadium.  Too bad food and drink are dull; popcorn, hot dogs.  Hard to believe in an urban area with great eateries!"
4614,Date of experience: October 2016,1-Oct-16,Big Ten,Northwestern,5,Go Cats,"I'm not a die hard fan of the Northwestern Wildcats, but do cheer them on when they play against other teams; teams other than ""Illinois Fighting Illini"", and plus I love college football. As for the stadium it's great! The seats, and everything seems so up close. I've never had a crappy seat, or any seat that seems so far away. Prices are great also! Buying gear, such as t-shirts, hats, lanyards, etc. at the stadium is so pricey! But it is also at a stadium, so of course the prices are going to be high. To save cash, It's best to buy gear outside of the stadium at a Ross Dress for Less, Target, TJ Maxx, Walmart, or Marshals. You'll thank me later : )For parking; just save yourself the headache, and park in the backyard of people offering it. You can't miss the signs while driving to the stadium. It's much more cheaper, and convenient. The neighborhoods are also safe, and I've never had any crazy incidents involving my car being vandalized. Other than that, enjoy the game, and Go Cats Go! : )"
4615,Date of experience: November 2015,1-Oct-16,Big Ten,Northwestern,3,Easy Accessible,"Take public transportation from the City or Burbs.  The train / subway gets you close enough.  Then, you can walk over.  Otherwise, take a taxi, Uber, Lift, etc.This stadium is imbedded into a very traditional suburban neighborhood."
4616,Date of experience: September 2016,27-Sep-16,Big Ten,Northwestern,2,The worst stadium we have ever visited,"Wow - where do I start?  I  know - the clear bag policy. First - it doesn't speed gate entry. It inconveniences ONLY the female fan. I got the stupidest questions about my wallet and a windbreaker jacket. Really?? Get over yourselves, Northwestern stadium personnel. Second - Our seats were three rows down from the top of the stadium. As we were going to our seats, we had to follow along a wall that had NO hand railings. Really surprised that city, county, state and/or federal authorities haven't looked at this because it is a HUGE safety issue. Thirdly - The availability of restrooms on the upper level was simply ridiculous. The guys had to walk UP two ramps to access it and the women had to walk UP THREE ramps to access theirs. Once in the bathroom, there was a step up which had a gray strip painted on the edge. Perhaps that shows up better at night when there is a light on in the restroom but during the day in sunlight not so much. I had dark sunglasses on and did not perceive the change of elevation thus stumbling over it. All the women in the restroom said they did the same thing as did those that came in after me. When washing my hands, the soap was fine but the water shot outwards instead of down so I got a shower I didn't want. The towel dispenser gave me one sheet about 6in wide and 6 in tall before jamming. C'mon - Northwestern. Your adjacent practice field is 10x better than the stadium turf which was a horrid MESS. It is LONG past time for your to build a new stadium!! This was NOT a pleasant visit. The ONLY thing that made it not a complete waste was the visitor team (of which I am a fan) WON the game."
4617,Date of experience: September 2016,25-Sep-16,Big Ten,Northwestern,3,Love the campus; the stadium not so much.,Quaint.  But more like a large high school stadium than big-time college football.  Understaffed and unprepared for more than a few thousand extra visitors.
4618,Date of experience: September 2016,18-Sep-16,Big Ten,Northwestern,4,Nice football stadium,"Had a great time watching Northwestern beat Duke.  Great site lines.  You can only bring in clear bags - purses can not be larger than 4"" x 6"".  Prices were reasonable for pop and hot dogs.  A short walk from the Purple CTA Line."
4619,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,Big Ten,Northwestern,3,It's a ball park,Great local fun afternoon. You certainly will run into someone you know. Grateful to have a facility lie this so local
4620,Date of experience: September 2016,11-Sep-16,Big Ten,Northwestern,4,Fun,"We had a great time at the NU game. I recommend it, it's perfect for a boring day.It's easy to get to and very cheep."
4621,Date of experience: September 2016,7-Sep-16,Big Ten,Northwestern,4,NU Game,"They've instituted a clear bag policy so if your purse is larger than a 4x6 clutch, either go into Walmart/Target and get a plastic purse OR purchase one at the tailgating store by the stadium for $10. Stadium itself is okay - no alcohol - but it's metal benches (which get HOT in September) with no backs. Totally fine for a game."
4622,Date of experience: November 2015,7-Jul-16,Big Ten,Northwestern,3,Old But Holding Her Own,"This historic college football venue is situated in the quaint village of this north suburb of Chicago. It's in pretty good shape, considering the age, and maintenance has kept issues to a minimum. At the end of the day, it's a great place to watch a football game and the night game under the lights was a treat. Parking is tough (what college town isn't?) so we recommend parking at the light rail commuter station for $4 and walking the 20 minutes or so to the stadium. They don't let you really walk around like most college stadiums. You are only allowed entry to the section on your ticket, so we were unable to catch up with friends in other locations during the game. Not sure I'd be happy with this more than the one road game every -other year. Be sure to arrive early and walk around the athletic facilities, including the indoor fan events they have in the basketball field house."
4623,Date of experience: November 2015,3-Jul-16,Big Ten,Northwestern,4,Iowa won but a great time was had,"We went to the Iowa football game with friends. We sat between both Iowa fans and the home town Northwestern fans. This was a day for Iowa. The space is great, the people are all friendly and the area around the stadium is terrific. Go to a game and have a blast."
4624,Date of experience: October 2015,29-Jun-16,Big Ten,Northwestern,5,Exciting Wildcat Football,"This is a great venue for college football. Called the Wrigley field of College stadiums, Ryan Field is a great mix of home town and college atmosphere right on Lake Michigan with a view of the Chicago skyline. It is an old time stadium, reminiscent of an earlier day. All that is missing is the wonderful smell of cigars."
4628,Date of experience: November 2015,14-Jan-16,Big Ten,Northwestern,4,Lots of character.,"Visited for the 2014 University of Michigan game. First time there. Great place to watch football. Food was avg, parking is horrible (typical of anything around Chicago). Stadium has lots of character and no bad seats. Fans aren't bad. Will go back in 16 when UM visits again."
4629,Date of experience: November 2015,23-Dec-15,Big Ten,Northwestern,4,Difficult to park,It??s a great stadium - We atended a couple of times and found ourselves freezing to death - Bring something to keep you warm!
4630,Date of experience: November 2015,16-Nov-15,Big Ten,Northwestern,4,Best value in Chicago area sports,"The 89th season at Ryan Field has concluded with an exciting year of Wildcat football. If you have young kids, next year get a family package for a game or even better get a season family ticket plan. It is the best value in Chicago sports. Be sure to take them to Wildcat Alley.The stadium is dated, and doesn't have modern amenities, but the views are great even if the seats are not comfortable--little leg room or elevation above the row in front. Walk to the south end of the stadium for better food selection. Or walk to Walker Terrace on the north end for a nice view during warm ups. Parking is a challenge, but usually can get a place on the street to the north or west. Can park on campus and take an uncomfortable school bus.The band is great for halftime, walking through the stadium during the game, pre-game, or in Wildcat Alley before the game."
4631,Date of experience: November 2015,15-Nov-15,Big Ten,Northwestern,4,"Great views, but could use an update","The great thing about this stadium is you can see your team closer than any other Big 10 stadium that I have ever been to, and that is a plus.It is easy to get to, from public transportation and the city of Evanston is beautiful.We liked the independent food vendors that offer a variety of tasty offerings from lobster rolls to Mexican.The $5 bottled water was a turn off for sure.The stadium however is old, and could definitely use some updating, don't see how ripping patrons off with the water charge is helping that."
4632,Date of experience: November 2015,7-Nov-15,Big Ten,Northwestern,3,Not Impressive,"Could definitely use some enhancements. A few more jumbotrons would be helpful to see what's going on during game play. Was our final Family Weekend at Northwestern,  next time we enter stadium will be for graduation.  Always seems to be empty seats."
4633,Date of experience: October 2015,25-Oct-15,Big Ten,Northwestern,5,"Would you rather sit with 100,000 people?","I remember when my father, a Northwestern graduate, took me to my first Northwestern football game in 1959, when the Wildcats beat Oklahoma, and again in 1961, when Northwestern briefly was ranked No. 1 in the country. I remember taking a date to a game when I was a high school student. I remember watching  state high school championship games in 1981-1984. I remember going to a Northwestern/Michigan game with a Michigan alum and sitting in the Michigan section. It was known as Dyche Stadium in those days. Built in 1926, it was named for William Dyche, Class of 1882, a former Evanston mayor and overseer of the building project. The smallest football stadium in the Big Ten Conference, with a capacity of 47,130, it was considered one of the finest college venues in the country at the time of its construction. Today, it is dwarfed by many college stadiums that seat 100,000 people and more. In 1997, the field was renamed Ryan Field in honor of the family of Patrick G. Ryan, an insurance magnate who was then the chairman of Northwestern's Board of Trustees and a major donor. Extensive renovations have given the stadium a comfortable small-college atmosphere. It lacks the glitz of larger, more modern stadiums but it has a Wrigley Field feeling to it. Visitors can commute via the Metra commuter railroad's Central Street stadium and the Chicago Transit Authority's Central station on the Purple Line. Yes, the corridors are narrow, the restroom facilities leave something to be desired and the food isn't catered by Spiaggia. But Northwestern makes every effort to accommodate its alumni and students. And you can't complain about the seating. Every seat has a good view of the field. Which is more than you can say if you're sitting in the back row of 110,000-seat Michigan Stadium and worrying about how you're going to get your car out of the parking lot."
4634,Date of experience: October 2015,18-Oct-15,Big Ten,Northwestern,4,Fun Atmosphere-as long as you don't need a restroom,"Attended the Iowa-Northwestern game.  Despite having visitors' seats, the curvature of the seating made it comfortable.  Event staff were friendly and helpful and even thanked people as they left. Food and beverage prices were quite reasonable for a big time athletic event.  As an older facility, there is a quaintness to it.  The only downside to our visit was the lack of restroom facilities, which must be part of the original design of the stadium.  There were incredibly long, slow-moving lines, even after the game had ended."
4635,Date of experience: October 2015,6-Oct-15,Big Ten,Northwestern,2,Old stadium that had a feel of smaller college.,"It's an old stadium, narrow corridors, crowded getting around except for ramps, no TVs anywhere, small scoreboard that didn't have stats. Stats were sparsely put on a narrow lit strip of signage mainly used for ads. Sit close to field, that was nice. Just ok."
4636,Date of experience: September 2015,1-Oct-15,Big Ten,Northwestern,3,Could Use A Facelift.,"My daughter is a freshman at Northwestern University. Football games are a big part of our family's entertainment as we also have a son at the University of Minnesota who is in the marching band. This is our second time at Ryan Field and I have to say that it really needs a facelift. Once you are seated in the stands, it looks very clean and well kept. Very nice. However, when wandering through the inside you can definitely tell that it is dated. The hallways are very narrow, which makes for people pile-ups during half-time and the paint is peeling everywhere. While they have some good food venders in a specific part of the stadium (local restaurant chains), if you want them and you are not seated close by their location, you have to walk all the way around to the other side of the stadium to find these restaurant venders. Otherwise,  you are left with the regular stadium food which is mediocre at best. On the plus side, they do have shuttles on game day that are very convenient and this is our mode of transport, so I can't speak about the parking situation. The shuttles run every 12 minutes before, during and after the game for about one hour. But, be prepared to sit on school buses that are jammed with students and not very comfortable. This doesn't bother me as the ride is so short, but may bother some. I'm just glad they offer the service.I guess, after having been in the TCF Stadium and Soldier Field, Ryan Field just can't compare. But, I love the University and am very happy that my daughter chose to go there. Go Wildcats!"

Often called the Wrigley Field of college football, this stadium offers good sightlines and is easy to get around.

Evanston is just a hop, skip, and a jump from Chicago so this ended up being the perfect game for us to see!  You really can't get a bad seat in this stadium!  My only complaint is that we had to take the train to the game and it kept breaking down."

4643,Date of experience: September 2014,8-Aug-15,Big Ten,Northwestern,3,Wildcats Home Field,"Nice old stadium of the Northwestern University Wildcats football team.  Security check entering the stadium.  We sat in section 131, which was near the 30-yard line, amidst a sea of purple (NU's team color).  Bought nachos and a polish dog.  Not much food or merchandise concessionaires; facilities can be improved.  Oh yes, NU beat Western Illinois 24-7."
4644,Date of experience: November 2014,13-May-15,Big Ten,Northwestern,3,Read This and You Will Enjoy the Experience,"This is my 100th TripAdvisor review so I want it to be a special one.NU is my beloved alma mater. I met my wife there and my first daughter is named after the dorm where I met my wife. Outside of my family, NU Football is the most important thing in my life. Go Cats!The stadium is small so you are close to the action. The field is natural grass and it is usually well-kept. Sight lines in sections 104 and below and 132 and higher are lousy. Don't sit there. 105 to 114 are on the East (sunny) side and there are no obstructed seats. I prefer sitting on that side of the stadium myself. Warning: Ryan Field is NEVER prepared for a large crowd. Concessions, crowd management, ushers, public transport, traffic management, etc. all are flummoxed by all these people showing up at the game. If you brace yourself for this, it will appear quaint to you.Here are other helpful hints for a visit to Ryan Field.1. You can almost always get tickets. The stadium will sell out once or twice a year due to an influx of fans from the opposing team. Even in these cases, the scalper's market is very active and not discouraged at all. I recall only once or twice where a ticket was nearly impossible to get...this hardly ever happens.2. It is very difficult to park at the stadium. If you are driving, either: 1) get there early, park in the neighborhood north or west of the stadium and walk or 2) park in downtown Evanston or on campus and take the shuttles to the stadium. You can also take the Metra or the L and get there (Central Street). Bear in mind it is a nightmare to leave the game on public transportation or via the shuttles...prepare yourself and your bladder! To minimize your pain, make sure you have a return fare to get out of Evanston.3. Tailgating. Tailgating in downtown Evanston or on campus is not allowed. You can ""tailgate"" sans car in the parking lots near the stadium. The lots adjacent to the stadium have the liveliest tailgates; you can bring a some beer and just hang out. You can buy a decent hot dog or brat at Mustard's Last Stand, which is on Central St. southwest of the stadium. The other option is to ""tailgate"" in the golf course (1/4 mile east of the stadium), which is used for parking on game days. This is a lot more pleasant because you will be on grass, but there are no places to purchase food. This being the Midwest, there will be ample food and some will gladly let you crash their tailgate. If you try this, opt for a larger, raucous tailgate.4. Pre-game bathrooms and if you are cold. There are porta-potties in the lots but the lines can be long. Instead, I use the facilities in the basketball arena north of the stadium. You can stand in the arena lobby or sit and watch the band before the game in the arena.5. Food in the stadium. In a nutshell, don't expect to eat. The selection is limited and the concession lines are long.6. Wildcat Alley. There is a place where you can get food and drink (in years past, even free beer) north of the stadium, adjacent to the basketball arena. Kids can play in the grass, and I am told it is a good time. Follow the signs or aim for the BB arena and take the walkway immediately east of the arena and head north.7. Souvenirs. The best place is Let's Tailgate, which is on Central west of the stadium (1807 Central). They have an amazing array of NU stuff (who besides me buys this stuff?) as well as Chicago sports apparel.Ryan Field/Dyche Stadium is a pleasant albeit run-down venue. Enjoy your visit. Go Cats!"

4653,Date of experience: October 2013,20-Jun-14,Big Ten,Northwestern,4,Not-Your-Typical Stadium...,"Was here for the Ohio State/Northwestern game In October 2013. I had tickets in Section 111 about 10-15 rows from the field and the visibility was great. Venue is on smaller side and reminded me of a large high school stadium. Stadium is somewhat dated and the 'guts' of it (concessions, walking ramps, etc) looked rundown. We took the L from downtown to the stadium which is convenient, but it is PACKED after the game and you have to wait for awhile to leave. Ryan Field is not located directly on Northwestern's campus, but rather in the middle of a residential neighborhood, which is a cool sight. Take some time to check out Northwestern's campus too! Would definitely return if the chance presents itself!"
4654,Date of experience: November 2013,29-Apr-14,Big Ten,Northwestern,4,Feels like an old school stadium,"Went to two Northwestern games last fall after moving to the area.  Like the fact that the stadium is very ""old-school"", oval with bleacher seats, real grass, reasonably priced concessions, get close to the action.  Described it to my kids as more like a larger high school field and a big stadium.  (Our previous experience was Univ. of Pittsburgh games at Heinz Field.)  Main downside is the influx of opposing fans for big games.  Felt like I was in enemy territory."

When was the last time you went to a Big Ten Football Game?  There are always tickets available so you can drive to Evanston spur of the moment.  It's fun to cheer the home team on and then go out for a pizza or a walk on the lakefront."

It was overhauled about 10 plus years back and the person who donated the money got his name put on it.  Well, it is a nice intimate stadium that holds around 47,000.  Not too big and if you were ever to drive out after a game you are glad that it only holds that many people.  Traffic stinks after the game, but if you park away from the stadium and walk you will get there and back to your car much faster.  Food is okay, but the team is fun to watch.  They don;t call them the Cardiac Cats for nothing.  As long as Coach Fitzgerald is there they are worth watching."
4667,Date of experience: September 2012,29-Sep-12,Big Ten,Northwestern,4,Great place to see a game,"Ryan Field, known as Dyche Stadium for the first 70 years of its existence, is a great place to see a college football game.It's a real blast from the past......barely modernized, the public areas of the stadium are pretty much just as they were in the 40s and 50s, I suspect. They haven't changed at all since I was a student in the early 80s....right done to the aluminum bleachers on which everyone sits (no comfortable single seats here--though season ticket holders can rent cushioned seatbacks. The crowd is mild, and almost painfully polite, so if you're decked out for the opposing team you'll be safe, as long as you don't act like a jerk.Don't expect much in the way of modern and varied concessions, either. Choices at almost all concession stands range from Vienna Beef hot dogs to Smoked Sausage sandwiches. One, maybe two areas sell something different.What has been updated is the field. Beautiful natural grass field....much better than the tacky carpet used for years.Access is easy...the Wildcats rarely sell out, as opposed to most Big Ten teams. And tickets are relatively inexpensive--$40 face value for non-conference games and $50 for conference games against the big guys of the Big Ten. Hint--look to StubHub for cheap tickets....often you can get seats for much less than face value if you shop early.Parking is almost non-existent, especially for non-season ticket holders. Use convenient Public Transportation. METRA commuter trains, the CTA Purple Line ""L"" and a special Pace Northwestern Shuttle--are easy to find and use."
4669,Date of experience: October 2011,23-Feb-12,Big Ten,Northwestern,4,Big 10 football with tradition,"Wonderfully traditional football stadium where passionate fans watch the Wildcats meet their foes on the field. Nothing fancy - no large expanse of executive suites, just good old-fashioned football on a Saturday afternoon or evening.  Food is decent and served by various campus organizations, which is a nice touch. Bathrooms are adequate for the crowds and seem to flow well. All seats have good view with the home crowd facing Lake Michigan - which helps in the late afternoon.Great way to watch pigskin action - no matter whether NU is vying for a bowl bid or not."
4670,Date of experience: November 2011,20-Feb-12,Big Ten,Northwestern,4,A great place to see a Game,"I went to see the Northwestern Wildcats vs. U. of Iowa there.It is a great place to see a game. It is very large! The whole experience was great. It is on the edge of the campus and you can easily walk to North Campus from there. There are alot of parking lots too, you can even park on the campus and walk there. It is very near the train also so it is very accessible to Public Transportation. Nice Place."

4686,Date of experience: October 2022,2-Oct-22,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Buckeyes Football at The Shoe,"We went to see the OSU Buckeyes beat Rutgers yesterday. This was our second visit to the Shoe but it had been awhile. A few notes:1. We parked at Fawcett Center - parking was $30 - it was a short walk (10 minutes) to the Shoe.2. There is tailgating EVERYWHERE - it appears police/security do not bother you if you keep it next to your auto/in your area - but do not walk around with alcoholic drinks.3. The tailgate parties by the stadium - have live bands, food trucks and drinks if you don't want to do your own tailgate. Beers are $8 - for 16 oz - they also have Claws, Jack Daniels w/mixers, etc.4. We went to the Scull session - it starts 2 hrs 20 minutes prior to game time in St. John's Arena which is next to the Show. Some suggested arriving very early. We got there about 40 minutes prior and felt it was too early. We could have gotten seats if we had walked in 10 or 15 minutes prior. The best seats are the ones facing the empty seats (you will understand this when you arrive) but those looked like they filled up an hour before. I recommend doing this at least once - fun to see the band (TBDBITL), the coaches and the players - and to get fired up for the game.5. We walked into the stadium about an hour before game time. This gave us time to find our seats and watch warm ups and pre-game festivities.6. Seats are tight for sure - not a lot of space. You can bring a cushion if you would like - but no bags larger than a clutch.7. Beers are $9.50 for 16 oz.8. Bathroom lines can be long - so plan ahead. You can also walk a little further and possibly find a shorter line.9. Don't miss halftime with tbdbitl - fabulous talent for sure!10.  The energy is fabulous for a game. Go and enjoy!"

Loved our 1st game and look forward to going back!
4694,Date of experience: November 2021,14-Nov-21,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Great Ohio State Win over Purdue in 'The Shoe',"My wife and I enjoyed attending the Ohio State-Purdue game on 13 Nov 2021.  With kickoff at 1530, we arrived approximately 45 minutes early to avoid crowds at the gates.  We entered the stadium near section 2C and were surprised at no line or waiting - we walked through the metal detector with our seat cushions and wool blanket without being 'wanded' by security.  The paperless tickets worked well - my wife loaded the tickets into her iPhone 'wallet' which led to easy scanning/entrance.  We walked around B deck for a while, got a beer ($17 total for two Coors Lights) and then proceeded to our C deck seats.  This was my 8th or 9th game in 'the shoe,' so I am accustomed to the small areas allocated for each person - definitely not constructed for today's average weight American.  We usually get seats 18 and 19, so we're on the end on the aisle.  Three young women in seats 15-17 stayed for only the first ten minutes of the first quarter since it was a chilly, windy day, so we had plenty of room to enjoy the game.  Seat cushions are a MUST - as are hand warmers during cold games.  I had hand warmers in my boots and extras ready if I needed them for my gloves.  Early into the first quarter I went down to the concessions and bought two Skull Session Lagers (total $21) to last us the rest of the game - 'boutique' beers such as this are located at a 'hands free' stand where you open an App on your phone, select the beer you want, pay with credit card or ApplePay, then simply show your phone receipt to a person at the stand...I saw at least four people walk into the area, grab beers, and then walk out the entry area instead of proceeding to the exit - this is likely a money loser for whoever operates it as dishonest folks can easily walk off with free beer - I mean, super easy!  I used the men's bathroom before purchasing the Skull Session lagers and, while early in the game, there was already a line for bathroom located in Section 16C - the stadium is definitely short on the number of bathrooms it needs.  Two years ago I waited 45 minutes in a line to use the bathroom during halftime...didn't make that mistake this year.  The halftime show by the Best Damn Band in the Land was fantastic with a 'Top Gun' movie theme - wow, impressive show.  The game had over 101K attendees, many of which had departed by the end of the third quarter since the Buckeye's destroyed Purdue.  We departed with three minutes left in the fourth quarter.  With Expo parking not in-service this year, we parked off the corner of Lane-Kenney avenues, behind Trove Warehouse for $20.  It's a bit of a walk, but we turn right onto Kenney, proceed a mile or two to Broadway, take a right and easily merge onto Hwy 315, take that for five or so miles, and then merge onto I71S...messing with parking garages on/around campus is a hassle and takes far longer to depart than walking a mile or so to Kenney Road.  While chilly, we had a great time for our annual pilgrimage to 'the Shoe.'"

It was cool to visit, since its a Historic place. Wouldve been really great to have been able to walk into the stadium and check it out, but do to the times. It was not an option. It is pretty cool to walk around and get some pictures of and one end, you can actually see in and see the field.  Maybe I'll beable to catch a game there one day!!"
4698,Date of experience: October 2019,1-Aug-20,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Covid Croud,"This year there will only be a fraction of the normally 110K fans attending since the Covid virus has curtailed attendance.  But for those attending next year, you can expect the noise level to literally be felt in the core of your body.  Don't expect a comfortable seat unless you are one of the luckier ones with seat cushions and a back. And you might measure your backside to make sure you can fit in such a narrow space.  The designer must have assumed everyone attending spent weeks at spinning classes simply to fit into those spots. Try to arrive early enough to walk around the 'Horseshoe"" and enjoy the photographs and memorabillia of teams gone by as well as the trophies earned by some of the best teams in the country. You can feel the history in the walls of the ""Shoe and if you listen intently you can hear the voices of those who made the history happen."

Had a great time, and the Food prices inside the stadium were not bad. Buckeye Donuts was great for Breakfast, and Eddie George's 27 restaurant was very good as well, however it has moved and is no longer within walking distance to the stadium. Tommy's pizza, was a letdown, and way overpriced. Got to get up close and even have a talk with some of the Fox Sports personalities and Ohio State players. Same with ESPN, and many of them hung out at Panera Bread right across the street from the Stadium. Urban Meyer's restaurant was booked solid and we could not get in, make advance reservations!!!!"

It is home of the Buckeyes football team and is also the site for the University's Spring Commencement ceremonies.  The stadium opened in 1922 as a replacement for Ohio Field with a seating capacity of 66,210.  The stadium was renovated and expanded in several phases.

4709,Date of experience: November 2019,24-Nov-19,Big Ten,ohio state,5,No longer a Horseshoe,"Nicknamed the ""Horseshoe"" because of it's shape for decades, the open end zone is now filled with seats so more like an oval.  Locals still refer to it as the 'shoe.  Attended the OSU - Penn State game and the atmosphere is fantastic.  Loved the self-serve drink station for sodas.  Buy your souvenir cup and then fill and refill yourself.    More stadiums should have this.  Sat in Section 17A -- this is immediately next to the club section on the home side, but you're still on the 25 yard line with great views of the game.  Seats 104,000+, which surprised me a little as it didn't seem as large as Alabama and Texas A&M's stadiums, and they both seat over 100,000.  This should be a bucket list visit if you're a fan of college football."
4710,Date of experience: October 2019,22-Nov-19,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Great place for a game,I love going to the stadium for games. Especially when they win.Most seats have a good view. Seats are tight together. Get the seat backs.

4718,Date of experience: October 2019,27-Oct-19,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Nice stadium and access,The stadium for an OSU game is a great visit. The atmosphere is one of the better ones in college football and the opening ceremonies are worth getting there early. Plenty of parking if you go down the lots on the main drive and get there early. Lines for bathrooms and concessions even at halftime were efficient and the gate system they used helped people get into the stadium quickly. A good time out even with a soggy game.
4719,Date of experience: October 2019,23-Oct-19,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Amazing experience,"There's nothing to compare with watching a football game with over 100,000 other fans. This stadium may be old but it is in very good condition and you can see well from almost everywhere. I say almost because I had a seat with a partially obstructed view, and I know that there are others with some obstructions, but likely only a relatively small number.The ushers I interacted with were very nice, and were focused on helping you have a great experience. One in my section went out of his way to make a Michigan State fan feel welcome and comfortable, despite being seated in a sea of Buckeye fans.The food isn't anything special one way or the other, and I didn't experience any unduly long lines.The one thing that you have to expect is that getting to the stadium, parking, and getting out of the area can be a major challenge if this is your first time there, as it was for me. The huge number of people and vehicles means that you really should arrive a good two hours before game time, and anticipate that it will take a long time to get your car out of the area after that game. It's not impossible, you just need to do your homework and have some patience. I you or whoever is going to the game with you are handicapped, be sure to contact Ohio State well in advance to get details on how they can assist you. Handicapped parking and elevator passes are available for those needing them.I don't live in Ohio but I am a Buckeyes fan, and coming here to see a game, the team, and especially the amazing marching band was a bucket list kind of thing. I was not disappointed."

Stadium area has plenty tailgating, food trucks, band and pre-game activity at St.John's Arena for skull session.  OSU band really is the best, worth watching pregame and 1/2 time shows!  Great screens visibility even in afternoon.  Ushers were friendly and helpful.  Amazed at ROTC activities, fun cheerleaders in the crowd.  Seats are comfortable, but wish we had chosen the padded option with ticketmaster - good view of the field and band.  As rain came with final minutes of game, crowd was orderly and easily ushered to cover.   Every Buckeye fan must do this at least once!  Team opponents are treated with respect.  Ohioans were all friendly."

4726,Date of experience: September 2019,22-Sep-19,Big Ten,ohio state,3,The overrated stadium for a university,"My wife and I went to take in the OSU-Miami football game and let me say that the Shoe, as it is popularly known, is very impressive and the seats allow one to view the game very nicely even from the upper benches.  The displays there allow a fan to keep track of who is running the chains, and the video replay is nicely done.  Both marching bands performed very well.That said, here is what I didn??t like and why I consider the Shoe an overrated attraction.1.  The parking is very spread out, and one can expect a twenty minute (or more) walk to the stadium from your car.  Oh, and bring at least ten to fifteen dollars for starters.2.  The concessions are of mediocre in quality and overpriced to boot.  We??re talking five dollars for a slushee and eight dollars for a domestic beer.3.  The restriction on carry bags take security concerns to the level of hostile design.  One wonders if the point isn??t so much to prevent black swan events as to create a fenced in market to overcharge.If your a big OSU fan, it??s worth going to at least once.  Otherwise watch it on TV or do something else on a Sunday."

The place is so old and rickety that you have to go on a long hike to find a restroom unless you're in A deck.

Game was so much fun to watch, the BAND WAS TOO, TOO GOOD. My kids loved it. Best way to spend the weekend. The hotdogs are delicious. Must visit this place if you are in Ohio."
4756,Date of experience: October 2018,11-Feb-19,Big Ten,ohio state,5,BEST COLLEGE FOOTBALL ATMOSPHERE,"When you enter Ohio Stadium, you walk into hallowed grounds. The history, the traditions, the love, the fun, the cheers, the teams, the wins (and losses), the band...so much to enjoy and revel in."
4757,Date of experience: September 2018,21-Jan-19,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Great way to spend a Saturday.,"Tickets are sometimes hard to come by, but if you can snag one, The Shoe is the place to be on a Saturday afternoon. The ambiance, TBDBIL (The Best Damn Band In the Land), the people watching and of course, the game! If you can make the climb, C-Deck is usually the best seats (don??t get caught beside the press box). It??s just a fun day! ?????????? GO BUCKS??"
4759,Date of experience: September 2018,11-Jan-19,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Fun! Fun! Fun!,"Always a lot of fun and high energy attending an OSU football game at the ""Shoe""! The stadium is bigger than some NFL stadiums and seats better than 100,000 Clean facility. Best to arrive early. Traffic is a mess, but very well organized by OSU police, the Sheriff's office, and Columbus police department. They have it down to a ""T"". Stadium lots fill quickly, but there are lots of private lots that open up and charge about $10. You will see plenty of tailgates. They set up as early as Friday before Saturday games. Restrooms plentiful. It is a steep walk to seats and most likely, you will be high up.  I have seen people who became ill carried on stretchers down the long flight of seats and they are well trained, making it look very easy. Seat go rapidly, although you are even likely to get reasonably priced tickets on Stub Hub on game day. Stay in your seats for halftime. You don't want to miss The Best Darn Band in The Land, the OSU marching band. They are phenomenal! Always put on a great show. Don't forget to enjoy the game!"
4760,Date of experience: November 2018,31-Dec-18,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Simply ranked #1 !!!,"The 'Shoe' is without question the place to be on a college Football Saturday!   100,000+ people getting cranked for a huge showdown in the Big Ten or maybe a top ten program daring to enter the Dragon's layer for a beat down! Who knows what the day will bring?!?!  Either way, this has tradition like no other and spirit unmatched by anywhere in America! Come early see the sights and see the TBDBITL do the 'Script Ohio'!  The #1 ranked college tradition of all time!  This will give you chills period even if you can't tie your own shoes, walk & chew gum, or wear crappy maize and blue colors, etc, etc,   JUST GET THERE!!! Go Bucks!  Very Historic and very Beautiful facility with all the amenities! Anyone can go to a game here."
4761,Date of experience: November 2018,20-Dec-18,Big Ten,ohio state,5,No lines at the ladies room!,First ever event I have been at where the lines to the ladies room was shorter than the mens!  Not sure if they just have more ladies rooms than normal but it was nice to go to a sporting event and not spend 30 minutes in a line!  Food and drink prices were absurd - $9 for a cup of hot chocolate.  I know it's normal for games but still irritating to get ripped off for something that costs about 50 cents to make!
4762,Date of experience: September 2018,17-Dec-18,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Stadium of Energy,What a great atmosphere! Staff on hand to help you find your way. The stadium and tail gating is so much fun.
4763,Date of experience: November 2018,28-Nov-18,Big Ten,ohio state,1,Only go if you are a local,"Not a place I would recommend for any family or basically anyone that is not ready to deal with multiple confrontations unless you are an OSU fan of course. There are a lot of local bars in the area that are really nice except that same rule applies again. The parking was really a pain and make sure you don't park next to any garbage barrel as they will be set on fire and it's a mess. Saw a group of OSU fans attack a car (because it had the out of state plate) and they beat it with bats, boards, rocks, kicked it and threw a rock through the window. All in fun I am sure. Won't go into any more detail but you get the idea. The arena itself was ok but is in need up a lot of sprucing up and modernization."
4764,Date of experience: November 2018,25-Nov-18,Big Ten,ohio state,4,OSU vs Michegan,"Great game but recommend eating before you go. Food selection extremely limited and expensive. Bathrooms very crowded, plan accordingly."
4765,Date of experience: November 2018,25-Nov-18,Big Ten,ohio state,5,OSU v. That team up north.,Priceless! Stayed at Holiday Inn Express on Olentangy River Road. Great game with some great people!
4766,Date of experience: November 2018,18-Nov-18,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Awesome sight,This was a stop in my bucket list and definitely worth seeing. I love the buckeyes. And the surrounding town was also very cool
4767,Date of experience: October 2018,1-Nov-18,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Best experience,We had the absolutely best experience at our very first Ohio State game! It was so awesome to see the Buckeyes play in person. We also did the OSU four miler and it was great to be able to go onto the field! If you haven??t been to an OSU game then you really should!
4768,Date of experience: September 2018,25-Oct-18,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Best place for college football and hot dogs,"What a tradition...great to see a live script OHIO by OSU Band (BDBIWC). You must have a hot dog or two, as they are steamed, and apply the brown ""Stadium Mustard"""
4769,Date of experience: October 2018,15-Oct-18,Big Ten,ohio state,5,College Football like no other place,"We are long time season ticket holders for OSU football.  The traditions and enthusiasm cannot be duplicated, especially when the opposing team is the University of Michigan. The physical facility has been updated to eliminate long lines for the rest rooms.  The downside is the prices for food are very high.  A bottle of water is $4 smal, $7 for large."
4770,Date of experience: October 2018,14-Oct-18,Big Ten,ohio state,3,O-H...,The stadium is great for OSU football games.  Bring plenty of patience to navigate the crowds!  Go bucks!
4772,Date of experience: October 2018,8-Oct-18,Big Ten,ohio state,4,Biggest Stadium in Ohio,"This a cathedral to college football.  Saturdays during football season draw approximately 200,000 fans around the stadium.  100,000 inside watching the game and 100,000 tailgating the game outside.  If you go to games when it is hot, wear sunblock.  If your seats are near the top, good luck walking down for a beer and back up again.  WARNING:  Do not bring large bags or purses.  They are not allowed in."

4774,Date of experience: October 2018,6-Oct-18,Big Ten,ohio state,1,OSU game,"This wouldn??t have been bad, but OSU must promote that they won??t let women take purses into the stadium. Clutches are okay. We were parked at Akerman and their suggestion was to walk it back to the car?!? Then when I said that was unacceptable, the gate guard said we could take the purse to the purse check. He sent us the wrong way (a hospitality guy had to set us straight) after that out of the way hike, we finally found some other women and couples (all pissed off) walking towards it. Then after standing in line and hearing there were probably 300-400 purses in there, we could go back to the stadium. Wasted so much time, because OSU doesn??t want to look silly, that we missed the band pre-game and the kick-off. Thanks OSU! Women don??t take a purse to a game!!!"
4775,Date of experience: September 2018,3-Oct-18,Big Ten,ohio state,4,Wet Saturday,"Visiting the shoe is a great experience.  However if you are expecting inclement weather, note that while there is obviously food and beverage service there is no place to partake of such food except in your seat or standing in the concourse areas.  And in the concourse areas there are no table or shelves or anything to hold your food/drinks while you eat.  We ended up standing by a condiment/trash area to partake.  In inclement situations, I suggest you eat at one of the nearby restaurants"
4776,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Oct-18,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Had a Great time,"Stadium was nice and clean, seats are bleacher style unless you have paid for fold out seats which are placed on top of bleacher seats. Not a lot of space due to trying to fit max people in. Each level has lots of food options, bathrooms, and places to buy items to represent your favorite OHIO team!  Parking I would say is the only issue. We parked in a lot about 5 mins away (walking distance 25 mins)  there are parking lots with buses, but be prepared to stand in line for a bus after the game.  We walked and there are plenty of nice side walks and police at every intersection helping to control traffic and people crossing."
4777,Date of experience: September 2018,1-Oct-18,Big Ten,ohio state,5,This Stadium is one of the best college stadiums ive ever been to.,"Was recently here for a buckeye game and had a wonderful time with my son. be prepared to pay for parking and walk, but once you get into the stadium there are several vendors inside for all of your snack and souvenir needs."
4778,Date of experience: September 2018,30-Sep-18,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Get tickets to a Buckeye game - it is worth it!,"Ok, let's be frank - OSU campus is intimidating. Parking is crazy during game day (well pretty much anytime). But, it is worth the experience. Seeing a game live at the Shoe is worth the hassle and cost. Go early! Take your time. Be patient and most of all have fun!"
4779,Date of experience: September 2018,25-Sep-18,Big Ten,ohio state,5,The Ohio State Football Stadium,If you are an Ohio State Football fan there are no bad seats.  C deck seats usually take a hike to reach but the view is awesome.
4780,Date of experience: September 2018,24-Sep-18,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Always great football fun!,I love going to a Buckeye football game.  The crowd is very energetic and most of the seats in the stadium have a great view.  The security guards are very nice as you enter the building and are checked.  Beware only wallet sized bags are allowed; check out their website for more information.
4781,Date of experience: September 2018,24-Sep-18,Big Ten,ohio state,4,A Storied College Stadium,"Ohio Stadium is one of a handful of venues that embodies the fervor (some might argue the tribal fanaticism) and spectacle of Division I/FSB college football.Listed on the National Register of Historic Places (1974) the stadium was built in 1922 with a controversial seating capacity of 66,210 and an unusual open ended ""U"" shape resembling a horseshoe. Despite modifications following WWII to increase seating capacity the last two decades have brought dramatic changes to the ""Shoe"" to meet increased seating and contemporary stadium expectations. Changes have included removing the the historic ""Jesse Owens"" track, lowering the field level, adding permanent seating to the open end, club seating and luxury suites, permanent lighting for night games, a multimillion dollar 174 foot HD scoreboard and ribbon screens to bring the capacity to just under 105,000 while still preserving the most notable historical elements of the original stadium. Like most major modern sporting events one's game day experience is likely to be inversely related to the size of one's wallet. Seating is essentially divided into three levels. C deck can be daunting and is the most removed from the field and stadium amenities. Most seating is numbered narrowly divided metal benches which many season ticket holders cough up the extra $$ for padded and backed seats that are placed and removed for each game. No you can't bring your own! FYI - it's always a good idea to check the university's website to see what is and is not permitted in the stadium.. What is and is not permittedSome seats even in levels A and B can have almost totally obstructed views. Because of its location on a campus that has 50,000 plus students and contemporary security measures parking anywhere near the stadium is practically nonexistent. Attending a game will require some planning ahead with arrival well in advance of game time, considerable walking, and the expectation of leaving to be just as time consuming. Bottom line: attending a game can be expensive, an all day commitment and inconvenient but you'll never forget the experience from the marching band's traditions (the pre game ""Skull Session"", entrance into the stadium, performing script Ohio), a hundred thousand plus fans doing O-H-I-O, the pageantry of mascot Brutus Buckeye and the cheerleading squads, and win or lose one of college football's premiere programs."
4782,Date of experience: September 2018,23-Sep-18,Big Ten,ohio state,4,Great experience,"College football is the reason football is so popular.  Ohio State and it??s traditions and pageantry exemplify why you play or watch football.You can??t experience this kind of atmosphere on tv...you have to be in the crowd.The fans were friendly, accommodating and respectful.   Great experience!"
4783,Date of experience: September 2018,10-Sep-18,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Welcome to my happy place,"I am a huge Buckeye fan and this place is one of my favorite places on earth.  I've been to lots of games in lots of places but this is my favorite.  The OSU athletics website has a bevy of parking options and the food is good here.  The concession stands move at a reasonable pace and there are plenty of places to buy swag.  Go to the skull session two hours before the game to see the vaunted OSU marching band play their music as well.  Lane ave has lots of places to get food and swag as well.  The seats in Ohio Stadium are generally comfortable and if you can get a club ticket, do it!  The food in the Huntington Club is incredible."
4784,Date of experience: September 2018,10-Sep-18,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Great experience!!,We attended a game on 9/8/18.  What a fun experience!! Always watch the games on TV.  The experience of an actual game is so much more.  The entire area is awash with red and gray. Lots of school/team spirit.  The campus is really beautiful.  The band is amazing.  There can be a lot of steps to climb depending on where you sit.
4785,Date of experience: September 2018,3-Sep-18,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Go Bucks!,We visited the stadium for a Buckeyes football game.  Great views from B deck.  We've sat in many sections and would recommend AA-B deck.  GO BUCKS!

During the season plenty of weekend excitement, tailgating,music from TBDBITL (the best damn band in the land), and of course, the game. Easy access from most points in town, but parking is always an issue. Maybe better to ride an express bus (COTA) or alternative transportation. Great fun and an all day adventure."
4787,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Sep-18,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Great place to watch a game,"Flew from Oregon for the Beavers-Buckeyes game & had a fantastic time! We got very lucky & got a parking pass to tailgate right behind the stadium! It started POURING at half time & there was lightning as well, which caused a 30 minute delay, which was a bit chaotic, but ended up being fine when the sun came back out. Fans were great & so friendly. Definitely going to come back!"
4789,Date of experience: August 2018,19-Aug-18,Big Ten,ohio state,4,Beyonce concert,"This stadium is  large football venue. It's open air so take shelter.  Large bags and backpacks are not allowed. There are concession stands where you can buy food and drinks. Seats are uncomfortable take a cushion if you think you'll need it. Binoculars help. Parking is available close by but it's a nightmare to exit. Consider taking the #2 , #8 bus and walking in."

There is NEVER anywhere to park around the stadium. The city is simply not equipped to handle osu traffic, and I wish osu would help. Now, I dread event days because of the traffic chaos."
4791,Date of experience: November 2017,13-Aug-18,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Our hometown Shoe,The horseshoe is an iconic Columbus landmark for sure. Built in 1921 and updated a few times it a great time to watch our Buckeyes win a football game. Concerts are excellent at the shoe and private tours are available other than durong football season. They are very low cost and not difficult to schedule. Google tours for details. Our group of about 15 paid a total of about $35 for a 2 hour tour that went everywhere from the band room to the box seats to even the locker rooms. We did that for my husband's birthday and he still tells people how awesome it was that he finally made it to the 50 yard line on the field!

I could write a list a mile long. This is their house. Visit it. Buckeye fan or not, it is hallowed ground in College football. Must see in Columbus. Go to a game if you can. Walk around the stadium, not just to your seat. Look at the place and feel it. It's older than any of us. The best place to watch a football game in the world."

If you want to see and feel all that is Ohio Stadium, get a seat in midfield on the rail (row 1 of C-Deck).  No other experience is comparable.  The facility is very old, the seats are very small, the restrooms are not idea (when you can get to one), but THE EXPERIENCE IS GREAT.  Do you want to understand the seismic waves, stand in C-Deck on the rail as the TBDBITL does the ramp entrance."

4826,Date of experience: October 2017,2-Feb-18,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Go Bucks,"Had good seats in Section c3. Great place to watch a game. Food lines are long. From our seats, you look toward the South end of stadium and can watch the OSU band. Also,you can easily see the band enter the field."

The staff is always helpful at the ticket office. We have seats up in D Deck and love the coverage that the press box provides in keeping us out of the wind and rain. A few helpful notes: 1) Be prepared to climb a LOT of steps, 2) Bags are not allowed through security, except for small wallets. Avoid bringing a bag as they will not let you in with it."
4828,Date of experience: September 2017,26-Jan-18,Big Ten,ohio state,3,Sooners dominate,It was a very good weekend at the game. The Oklahoma sooners came to town.

Sitting in the stands and waiting for the best band in the land to take the field. The tension builds and all eyes are on the tunnel. Suddenly, you see a glimpse of movement and the the field commander emerges, high-stepping and yielding a baton and tall hat, then the drum cadence and quick, precise movement of the marching band into the field. Every Buckeye fans should experience this at least once in their lifetime!"

The crowd was electric and there is nothing that beats being in ??The Shoe?? on game day Saturday. The ushers were nice enough to take our picture too! If you can get to a game to visit the stadium you will not be disappointed. It??s something we look forward to each year.

4834,Date of experience: August 2017,3-Jan-18,Big Ten,ohio state,4,Concert Venue / Football Games,"I have had the pleasure of visiting Ohio Stadium many times. Visits have included concerts and football games. First and foremost parking is a challenge. Typically you need to park off site and bus in. Parking near the stadium is very limited due to be on the campus of OSU.The stadium is historic and has experienced many renovations. It is modern in the loosest sense of the term. It offers the basics and not much more.As far as vantage points go don't expect to be blown away. There are a lot of obstructed views due to seats and additional decks being added.As far as concerts go I will avoid it in the future. It is a C- concert venue.As far as OSU games go the stadium itself does not add to the experience. However, the 105,000 students and fans make it a once in a lifetime experience."

4837,Date of experience: December 2017,8-Dec-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Amazing,"This is one of the most impressive college  football stadiums in the USA. The atmosphere is amazing and the stadium is almost always filled closed to capacity for all OSU games, regardless of the opponent. The food is standard stadium fare and the lines can be somewhat long but otherwise there is nothing like watching a night game at the Shoe. Over the last couple of years they??ve also started to offer beer service  in the stadium."

We landed a parking lot pass right by ESPN Game Day, Big Nut was in our parking lot so we got to meet him and take pics.  The game it self was Awesome, what a come back.  We got to go down on the field afterwards and take some pics with the band. It was a great experience, I would say to go early so you have time to take it all in:)"
4840,Date of experience: November 2017,20-Nov-17,Big Ten,ohio state,2,Very disappointed,"For such a large stadium, I was disappointed in the facility.  My friend calls it ""dumpy.""  No, we aren't from Michigan.  The band was great though.  Food choices limited and not enough signage inside."

This is from a TV guy in the compound. We depend on the school for a meal before the broadcast and OSU routinely comes in the top 3. I??ve never watched a game from the stadium, but that has to be an incredible experience as well."
4842,Date of experience: December 2016,16-Nov-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,The largest stadium I have ever been in my life,"Also called ""The shoe"", reference to its format (a horse shoe), it is huge and well prepared for the crowd."
4843,Date of experience: November 2017,15-Nov-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,I was a Boy Scout Usher in the 60's. A special place,A great place to visit. Go around to the river side and go in Gate 23. They will let you walk in and see the magic. You can almost hear Woody yelling. Special memories of cold Saturday afternoons spent cheering the Buckeyes.
4844,Date of experience: November 2017,13-Nov-17,Big Ten,ohio state,4,Another thing off my bucket list,"Nothing else like watching a game with 107,000 fans. Truly a cathedral of college football with a historical feel, and a must visit for any die hard football fan.Staff and local police do a superior job of getting 107,000 plus fans in and out of the stadium. Though the staff is friendly, I would agree, signage inside the stadium is lacking especially in the upper decks. Concessions are also hard to come by in the upper decks, but I give that pass since the stadium is old and there is not much room in the upper decks."
4845,Date of experience: November 2017,11-Nov-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,An Ohio Landmark,"Ohio Stadium holds a special place in the hearts of people who live in Ohio. You can't really understand Central Ohio unless you understand the place the Ohio State Buckeyes holds in our hearts. Few people choose to get married during a game and for good reason: guests will choose the game over the wedding. Yes, we are crazy. And the stadium represents us more than any other landmark."
4846,Date of experience: November 2017,10-Nov-17,Big Ten,ohio state,4,Beautiful Stadium,"Buckeye Stadium is impressive with its decor sitting on campus of OSU. The stadium holds over 100,000 screaming fans."
4847,Date of experience: November 2017,8-Nov-17,Big Ten,ohio state,3,PSU then IOWA holy buckeye,"Ohio stadium is a classic venue with the fundamentally flawed idea that the average person is 16 inches wide. Like a giant bingo card I have FOUR three hundred pound gents in a row, making me pop out of the bleachers like a champagne cork. The language of the booze filled fans is disgusting. Beating Penn State was the highlight of the year and losing to Iowa was the other extreme. If you like Buckeye football this place is five stars. If you can't tolerate inebriates yelling streams of obscenities for three hours non-stop, stay at home."

Even if your team isn??t playing, it??s a sight to see all of the Ohio State fans cheer on their Buckeyes. I hope you can make it soon!"
4849,Date of experience: October 2017,31-Oct-17,Big Ten,ohio state,2,Help I'm lost,It was mayhem when we got there.  The signage is hard to understand.  We had to ask for help from staff 3 times.  Staff was very helpful
4850,Date of experience: October 2017,30-Oct-17,Big Ten,ohio state,2,PSU/OSU game,"I was looking forward to a great first time at The Shoe.  This may sound like ""sour grapes"" but I was extremely disappointed to be exposed to the rabid OSU fans behind us in Row 19 of C-10.  From the get go this individual(s) did not represent the OSU Athletic Department's plea to be the Best Fan in the Land.  My granddaughter was exposed to the worst type of fan.  In fact we were sitting with several former Nittany Lion mascots along with the PSU Alumni Association administrative person and President.  They considered getting the section usher involved in removing the this fan or fans.  But decided otherwise.  This was the second time I have been exposed to this type of OSU; the last time was at Beaver Stadium.Also the stadium serves beer until the second half.  So you have half drunk fans standing at the Mens Room urinals with two cans of beer in one hand complaining about how long it takes to reach the point of elimination.  Great example for the children also waiting."
4851,Date of experience: October 2017,29-Oct-17,Big Ten,ohio state,1,Not fan friendly.,"I attended the Penn State/Ohio State game and found the venue not so fan friendly. The lack of comfort facilities was only the beginning. Our seats were on the third level and the cattle-shoot stairway was dangerous. If you stopped or slowed down on the way up or down you were pushed aside by the crowd.  Speaking of which the Ohio State faithful were rude and obnoxious especially after they had a few drinks in them.  Yes, there are beer sales at the college stadium definitely a bad idea. Crazy fans and beer don??t make nice company. I have been to a number of college and professional parks and stadiums and this by far ranks as one of the worst to visit if you are an opponent."
4852,Date of experience: October 2017,27-Oct-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Incomparable!!!,"What else can one say?Ohio State football. 109,000 fans. The Best Damn Band In The Land. Childhood, high school, college and adult memories of GREAT games, Fabulous teams, great friends and family.GO BUCKS!"
4853,Date of experience: October 2017,23-Oct-17,Big Ten,ohio state,3,Not Bad,"It's a decent stadium, but not nearly as nice as I expected, since so many people talk about it being good. I went to Penn State and I've been biased against Ohio State since marching there years ago, but the stadium still doesn't really impress me."

For all the hype behind this one, I wasn't impressed. The fans weren't as bad as many people had led me to believe they would be. I'm sure I'll visit again for a game, but I'm not excited about it."

4857,Date of experience: October 2017,10-Oct-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Great photo spot!,"We visited Ohio stadium and took pictures on the north end where you can see out to the 50 yard line from outside the stadium.  It has been quite a while since I have been inside, but I remember it as the best football venue I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing.   The outside was enough to spark fond memories of the Buckeyes' last national championship year, which happened to be the last time I was inside. My local friend and I were able to show Ohio stadium to a Texas native seeing Columbus for the first time."

4859,Date of experience: October 2017,8-Oct-17,Big Ten,ohio state,4,"Best Event in Sports, Period!","I've been to probably 20 - 30 Buckeye games. I've also been to many other sports venues; PSU, YSU, Browns, Indians, Pirates... Going to an OSU football game is not only attending a football game, it is an event. If you go, you need to take the time to take in all the tradition, the campus, the atmosphere, etc. Get there early and go to the Skull Session at St. John's Arena. It's a pep rally where TBDBITL (The Best Damn Band In The Land) plays a number of different sets. Each time it is different. Then the team comes in and lines up and the head coach (Urban Meyer at this time) and another coach or speaker of choice may give a pep talk. This past week when I went, Jack Nicklaus, The Golden Bear and his wife were in attendance. He gave a short talk about OSU and TBDBITL and then he and his wife conducted the band during 'Fight the Team.' Pretty cool to see the best golfer of all time directing The best marching band of all time!When you attend the game, make sure you stay in your seats for half time! Until you've seen the OSU band perform, you don't know what it is like to witness TBDBITL. It's an experience you won't forget. I get it, it's just a band. That's what I thought when I went to my first game over 20 years ago. Believe me, it's an experience. The only downside... the seats. They are tight. I'm not fat, but I'm 6' 1"" about 215. Pretty much all the seats are stadium aluminum bench seats. Some seats (depending on your ticket) do come with a seat back cushion. They are still tight, just softer with a back. I'd recommend taking a cushion if you don't have one with your ticket.So if you've never gone to a game, get a ticket and experience the best thing in sports! GO BUCKS!"
4860,Date of experience: September 2017,29-Sep-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Go Buckeyes!!!,"I have been a Buckeyes fan for 50 years but never to a game until now.

4861,Date of experience: September 2017,27-Sep-17,Big Ten,ohio state,4,Good Fans Nice Stadium,We were in town for the OU Sooner vs OSU.  Everyone was nice before the game as they though they would win.(we were told be careful if they loose)  OU beat them at home.  Even during and after the game we were met with loyal fans who where very nice. The line to get in was busy and took some time so if you want to see the game you will want to start early.  Warning they are Very Strict about the size of the Bag you take in.  They were not making any Exceptions so be sure and check before you go.  Put things in your pocket if you need to make the size fit.  Then put it back in on the inside. The trash can was full of them.  The Stadium is large and being a visitor we had the nose bleed seats in the corner.  It was a Long climb and a Lot of stairs (not a ramp) getting to our section.  If you need an elevator you will want to go in plenty early as the line was long.  After the game we waited for the elevator and it moved a lot of people fast.  It is a wonderful stadium and we are glad we had a chance to see it full.  They have a great selection of food so if you don't like what you see in your section walk around.   Walking the tailgating and area was fun.  Lots to do prior to the game so come see the campus too.
4862,Date of experience: September 2017,26-Sep-17,Big Ten,ohio state,4,Historic but needs some help,"Came to OH for the big OU vs OSU game. Very friendly OH fans made for an enjoyable day of tailgating ""close"" to the stadium! Huge campus-will be walking a far distance to the stadium from just about anywhere on campus it seems. Stadium itself was historical but could use some updating. Was seated in the end zone and only had port-a-potty's for use (long lines as well)! Overall a great experience at ""the Shoe!"" (the W helped!)"
4863,Date of experience: September 2017,25-Sep-17,Big Ten,ohio state,4,"When in Columbus, if you can, go to a game at this awesome stadium.","This is a fun and impressive place to visit. They put on quite a show and the games are always exciting thanks to the fans.I only wish the fans were a bit more courteous to the entertainment /band part of the visitors.Lots of vulgarities and profanities on display, so prepare youngsters under twelve  for this part of display."
4864,Date of experience: September 2017,24-Sep-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,College Football Bucket List,"I have always loved college football, and visiting some of the iconic stadiums has been a desire of mine. The home of the Buckeyes was an awesome place for a football game. The crowd was incredible, the traditions were nostalgic, and the general atmosphere invoked a sense of childlike wonder. Strong shoutout to the stadium staff and officials who were all warm and helpful to my friend and me (we were clueless of how to get to our seats). The best place I've ever been to watch a football game."
4865,Date of experience: September 2017,24-Sep-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Cool experience,"Once in Columbus, come here to watch a game, that's really awesome, great experience, especially local Buckeye University team matches"
4866,Date of experience: September 2017,23-Sep-17,Big Ten,ohio state,4,Love the Buckeyes,Awesome ?? stadium is all that can be said. Awesome football team playing here. Beer is a little pricey but it is fun place to watch the game. Buckeyes won big today. Had decent seating and had a lot of fun. Parking was a long walk but worth it. If you have a chance to see a game from here you need to go.
4867,Date of experience: September 2017,22-Sep-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,I have been an usher for 9 years,"It is a wonderful experience from the skull session to the player walk to the stadium and Urban Myers personally shaking the hand of each individual player as they enter the field to the entrance of entrance of the Best Damn Band in The Land coming in the north end of the stadium and performing the traditional Script Ohio. Each child attending a game for the first time can receive a certificate commemorating this. The atmosphere with 105,000 fans cheering is electric. Although a little expensive it is a rewarding experience."
4868,Date of experience: September 2017,20-Sep-17,Big Ten,ohio state,3,Average at best,"I was really looking forward to this experience and it didn't live up to the hype.  I've been to some great stadiums and this one just seemed flat.  Of course, the prices are outrageous for snacks but I guess that is to be expected."
4870,Date of experience: September 2017,18-Sep-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Baker and the Sooners visit Ohio Stadium,Nearly every single fan was welcoming of the Oklahoma Sooner contingent of fans.  The facility itself could use an update as the bathrooms were sparse and dated.  Our seats were in end zone but we enjoyed the game a great deal.
4871,Date of experience: September 2017,17-Sep-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Oklahoma vs. Ohio State game!,"We went to the top five matchup between Ohio State and Oklahoma and really enjoyed our experience here. I'm an Oklahoma fan, and I found the fans to be very accepting of the visiting fans. The stadium is loud, over 109,000 fans! Seats were in the C deck, which I found very adequate as we could see the whole field. The concessions are good, had the pizza and was impressed! The parking was a bit of a problem, over 1.5 miles from the stadium which led to a big walk. Great experience and would do again!"
4872,Date of experience: September 2017,17-Sep-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Best Stadium in America,"What else is there to say?  Best team and best stadium in America.  Glad they sell beer now, even if $8 per."
4873,Date of experience: September 2017,16-Sep-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Oklahoma vs Ohio State  9/9/17,"I read some of the reviews.  The negative ones are far from true.  We drove up from North Carolina and wore our Oklahoma Sooners attire.  The Ohio State fans were so friendly and accomidating.   There is parking in various places on campus.  No more than a 15 minute walk from any parking lot or deck.  The parking across the river, has a shuttle.  The campus is pretty, well worth any walk.  The student union was open with bathrooms and lots of food.  That was nice.  By the stadium, you had to use the porta potties until you could go in to the stadium.  There is no visitor side.  Oklahoma fans were mixed in with the Ohio State fans."
4874,Date of experience: September 2017,16-Sep-17,Big Ten,ohio state,1,Overrated at best,"I was disappointed in the how rude and disrespectful the fans were during my visit. I thought the stadium was old and not worthy of the ""praise"" it is given.  In the upper deck there is no running water, only porter potties for ""restrooms."" No food in the upper deck either, as you had to down levels to get food or drinks (I was in the end zone upper deck). I was just disappointed 100% with  the stadium and experience over all."
4875,Date of experience: September 2017,15-Sep-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Ou v Ohio State,Very welcomed at and around the stadium.  Be prepared to walk A LOT as there is little parking anywhere close to the stadium.
4877,Date of experience: September 2017,13-Sep-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Impressive stadium and campus!,"Drove all the way from Oklahoma to see the game. I couldn't believe how friendly the fans were! We were sitting in our car, and a couple came to my door and welcomed me to Columbus, and wished us luck for the game! We had another guy come up to us and invite us to the Skull sessions before the game, and wish us luck. Had another guy come up to us, and give us tips to avoid the traffic after the game! I can't say enough how nice the fans and people there were to us.Of course, when this stadium holds over 105,000, there is going to be long lines for everything and traffic and parking was crazy. It was all worth it though!The stadium was huge. It was great to visit such an iconic football stadium and town. Thank-you to all the fans and congratulations on such a wonderful stadium!"
4878,Date of experience: September 2017,13-Sep-17,Big Ten,ohio state,1,Parking and Transportation Options are Far from the Stadium and Fans are Threatening,"While we enjoyed the opportunity to attend a game at the Horseshoe, parking options were all far away from the stadium so we chose to take Uber.  While the Uber ride to the stadium was ok, accessing Uber after the game was a nightmare.  We had to walk all the way to the basketball arena to meet up with our driver.  He had difficulty accessing us because highway exits were closed and the sheer number of vehicles and people walking the streets made movement come to a grinding halt.  We were fans of the visiting team and the Buckeye fans were generally not welcoming.  When we tried to greet Buckeye fans with ""good luck"" before the game, some of them made threatening comments.  We were very uncomfortable.  We sat in the visitors section and were really packed in.  There were no individual seats.  Even after taking the elevator, we had to walk up 30 rows to get to our seats."
4879,Date of experience: September 2017,13-Sep-17,Big Ten,ohio state,4,Legendary stadium,"Great place to watch a football game!  (Especially when your team wins!).  It's HUGE!  There were 109,000+ people there.  And you could certainly tell by the will call line - it was painfully slow.  Our visitor seats were in 8C and I was VERY impressed with the amount of womens restrooms.  Every time I went to the bathroom, there was no line for the womens - I've never had that happen at any stadium!  Walkways by concessions/bathrooms were very narrow - not much room to move around.  Not sure when it was remodeled, but I think it's been awhile.  The upper deck (C level) is VERY steep - be careful going up there!  But it was a GREAT day!"
4880,Date of experience: September 2017,12-Sep-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Great College Football Atmosphere!,We recently traveled to Columbus for the Oklahoma vs. Ohio State football game. The campus and city are beautiful and the people were wonderful! No fan base could have been more friendly and welcoming. From the merchants in Short North to German Village and the employees in the local grocery stores everyone went out of there way to be helpful! The stadium is historic and from a Sooner view - the game was great! Had a great time and plan to return to Columbus again just to see some of the many things we missed - thank you to the folks of Columbus and The Ohio State University for a memorable experience!!!!!!
4881,Date of experience: September 2017,11-Sep-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Great facilities and welcoming fans!,"We drove into town for the OU vs OSU game and had really been looking forward to checking out the Ohio Stadium. My father and I have called this a bucket list stadium for us to attend and it was worth it.  It lived up to the hype! It is a great venue for games. Most impressive though was the kindness of most of the Ohio fans while tailgating and at the game. They were all very welcoming and definitely made this an even better experience. Our stadium doesn't allow the sale of beer so that was a nice little change too. The only thing amiss with the whole stadium is the amount of time you could spend waiting in lines, in the bathroom or for food and drinks. Sure there is a TV to watch while you wait but it is not the same as being able to move around quickly to get back to your seat. Those Buckeyes sure know how to tailgate!"
4882,Date of experience: September 2017,10-Sep-17,Big Ten,ohio state,4,Fans & workers were very friendly & welcoming!,Went for the recent OU vs OSU football game. Traveled all the way from Oklahoma & I can honestly say OSU has an awesome stadium staff & the fans are top notch. The food/ bathroom lines can get fairly long. Note: you will miss parts of the game if you go at halftime...go during the quarter breaks.
4883,Date of experience: September 2017,10-Sep-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Great Venue For a College Football Game,"In years' past, your food options were quite limited, but now you can get tacos, pizza, grilled cheese... a lot more than nachos and hot dogs (though, you can still get those). We sat in B deck on a cold night and were burning hot. So, don't just consider the weather that day/night, but also where you'll be sitting! Go Bucks!"

The stadium is a great place to watch a college football game.  There are plenty of places to eat and lots of restrooms for women. You have to bring a small purse to get it.  Make sure you look at the size requirements before you show up to the gates or they won't let you come in.  The suites are also fabulous with the option to have it catered.  They also have wifi and their own bathrooms.  There is also a place to get food in the suite area if you are not having your suite catered.  The energy throughout the stadium is so electric; its like nowhere else!  This is a must see and do sometime in your life!

It was my first game and the stadium seating was reasonably priced, as we bought the tickets on a ticketmaster resale site.  However, when you think college football, the tickets are kind of expensive.  But, the atmosphere at an OSU game can't be beat!"
4888,Date of experience: November 2016,16-Aug-17,Big Ten,ohio state,4,A great place to watch football,"The stadium is a great place to watch football, but is showing its age.

4889,Date of experience: August 2017,14-Aug-17,Big Ten,ohio state,4,Great picture from the South side,"We were in town for Comic Con and took the opportunity on Sunday afternoon to check out the stadium.  GPS took us right to the north entrance.  There was very little activity.  We were able to drive from the North entrance (where the O is) down the east side of the stadium to the South entrance, park and get out to take some pictures.  The south side provides the best backdrop for pictures as ""Ohio Stadium"" lettering is clearly in view vs. the North side where the O is covered with a protective translucent reflective material that made a good shot impossible when we were there. Our special needs niece, who is a huge Buckeye football fan, was with us and is elated with the close-up picture of her with the stadium in the background."

Just sucks for me cuz I need a big handful of stuff to LIVE lol. Being raised in WV it's nice to be in a sea of that scarlet and gray instead of blue and gold haha. The Buckeyes have an impressive football program and even I notice and I am not into sports. But I love the excitement of THIS! If you can afford to attend just one game then do so. We went to the 9/2/16 game and it was great pretty much a guarantee win lol. It was hot and I planned and used sunblock as I would on a beach. People, the sun doesn't go away! Use it. The benches and seats are highly reflective! We will go again in the early fall. Columbus is insanely cold In November but to each their own."

The narrow allowance per derriere has shrunk to a number that is inversely proportional to the gain in human size in the USA.To compound matters, the money hungry have begun selling fixed seats for the season, which take away flexibility if you are trapped between season subscribers.No longer a pleasant Saturday.

4925,Date of experience: September 2016,24-May-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,One of the must sees in college football,"Ohio stadium is amazing.  From the tradition to the spectacle during game day are just awesome.  We went to a game versus a team that wasn't expected to win by any means and the crowd was still alive as if they were playing ""that team up north""...Great food and drink choices, over-priced but then again all stadiums will be.   Overall great atmosphere and something to see at least once if you're a fan of college football."
4931,Date of experience: October 2016,16-May-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,OH-IO!!! Best Stadium Around,"Not a bad seat in the house, great food locations and varieties of menus. Now that beer is being served, can't any better than this. Go Bucks-Beat Xichigan!!"
4935,Date of experience: October 2016,25-Apr-17,Big Ten,ohio state,3,Love the history!,"I love the stadium and it's history, but I prefer to stay at home to watch the games. Tickets, parking and food all are getting pricey. I only go if it's a free ticket or a special game (like at night). The seats are to close together. By the time everyone gets there you are two seats down from where you should be and you can't move. Some dude complained while I stood when the band and team ran in... Who sits for that?"
4937,Date of experience: October 2016,20-Apr-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,"You haven""t felt the excitement of OSU football till you sit in the stadium",We have had tickets all over the seating in the stadium and never had a bad view.  The huge screen on the end of the horse shoe lets everyone see everything up close and personal.  Watching the OSU band come under the stands and onto the field sends goose bumps all over you.  What a way to spend a Saturday in Columbus..   Go Bucks
4938,Date of experience: October 2016,19-Apr-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,OSU vs. Northwestern,"One of the most historical college foot stadiums. The atmosphere is great, as long as you're a Buckeye fan."
4943,Date of experience: November 2016,6-Apr-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Columbus Tradition,We have attended OSU Football games several times over the years and always enjoy the electric atmosphere around and inside the Shoe.The tailgates and pre-game meetings are very fun-filled.
4944,Date of experience: October 2016,2-Apr-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Football heaven!,"Ohio Stadium is ground zero for OSU Buckeye football fans. As a season ticket holder I'm a big fan of the ""shoe"" or horseshoe as it was once shaped! The enhancements have enclosed the stadium so that's no longer the U shape. Dress warmly as the wind whips through here and you'll freeze to death! Bring a soft seat cushion or blanket to sit on because the seats are stone."
4947,Date of experience: November 2016,25-Mar-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Good football environment,"Filled with tradition, school spirit, and fall fun, this is a must do experience for any buckeye fan. Avoid B deck, as viewing can be restricted by poles or the overhang of c deck. Any seat in c deck will give you a great view. Make plans to attend the skull session before the game to get pumped up with the band and team! You can also rent the stadium to take pictures."
4948,Date of experience: October 2016,22-Mar-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Amazing place!,"We were here for a race and have been before for games as well. Always look forward to ""the shoe"". Love it. See you at the spring game!"
4949,Date of experience: September 2016,16-Mar-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,One of the greatest venues in college football!,"As a season ticket holder for the past 20 years, I am certainly bias.  That being said, Ohio Stadium is an incredible place to take in a game day experience. I have been in stadiums all around the country, and I can tell you from experience that Ohio Stadium is among the best.  There is easy access to the restrooms and concessions stands, available wifi and cold beer for sale!  The HD score board insures that you never miss a down and replays (good and not so good) are always there to make sure of that.  It's especially great when watching games with family or when the home team beats down that team up north with your best friend from Detroit!"
4950,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Mar-17,Big Ten,ohio state,4,Go there for football games,Food  and drinks are really overpriced!!!!! Eat before you go to a game. Sometimes parking can be challenging and then getting out of the parking lot. Allow extra time
4951,Date of experience: September 2016,13-Mar-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,College football at its finest,"I've seen a lot of football games in a lot of stadiums but Ohio Stadium is a unique experience first of all you have 110,000 screaming fans and if that doesn't give you goosebumps nothing will. Home of the Ohio State buckeyes powerhouse football team packed to capacity and rocking almost every Saturday in the fall, if you're a Buckeye fan this is a must on your bucket list, you will not be disappointed."
4952,Date of experience: October 2016,13-Mar-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Home of the Buckeyes,There is no better place to watch college football. The atmosphere in and around the stadium is simply electric. GO early enough to catch the band at St. John arena before heading over to watch the football Buckeyes in the Stadium. Get to the stadium early enough to take it all in. Great way to spend a Saturday afternoon.
4953,Date of experience: September 2016,13-Mar-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Incredible Football. Unbelievable Fans O-H-I-O,It was big. It was red. It was loud. A Scarlet and Gray frenzy of insane Buckeye Fans. Eat Drink A Lot and Be Merry.

Building the football stadium and beating Michigan for the first time!
4960,Date of experience: November 2016,27-Jan-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Even Better the Second Time Around,"This is our second trip to Ohio Stadium, the last being in 2012. Although Nebraska lost the game, the Ohio State fans won our hearts (again). I found that Nebraska and Ohio State fans have a lot in common. We both love to tailgate, take our football seriously, and consider hospitality to visiting fans with extreme importance. We were not disappointed, perhaps topping our very first visit in 2012. The tailgate experience in the Medical Center lot with Barney and Mike, former Buckeye players, was the best. The infrastructure of the entire area lends to easy egress after the game, pretty remarkable when you consider that's 110,000 people moving out. Event Staff at the stadium were very friendly, allowing us to walk around inside the stadium to take a multitude of photos. One supervisor even provided us with a program that he had bought. I've never had this happen before. Fans were cordial and didn't rub it in when their beloved Buckeyes really stuck it to Nebraska on the field. I really look forward to our next trip to the Shoe in 2018!"
4961,Date of experience: October 2016,17-Jan-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,"Great, huge stadium","A wonderful place, with a great band!!!They do need bigger TV's under the B deck, so if you can sit closer to the field, that would be better.  (Preferably near BigNut, the famous fan on TV, who is fun to watch.)  We plan on going once a year from now on, and staying at the Springhill Marriott Suites, which was worth the money.  Great place and we walked to this stadium - less than one mile.  Perfect, since it's always best if you don't have to park near this stadium, FYI."

4965,Date of experience: November 2016,5-Jan-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Best Stadium In the Country,"Love everything about Ohio Stadium!  Food, drinks, festivities, people, seats!  Something everyone should experience at least once!!"
4966,Date of experience: November 2016,5-Jan-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,This is a place you MUST visit before you DIE,Ohio Stadium built in 1921 is a National Landmark because it does not give up its tradition and history for seats.  The feel of the Horseshoe still lives but the conveniences of a modern stadium are available.  Truly one of the Greatest Stadiums on Earth.
4967,Date of experience: October 2016,4-Jan-17,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Amazing Stadium,"For all buckeyes this is home, every time I'm in this stadium the vibe is amazing, It's the best foot ball experience you can get day or night rain or shine this place on game days are full of excitement and energy."
4968,Date of experience: September 2016,31-Dec-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Love this satdium!!,I have seen so many games here.  We love just walking around the stadium too.  A great venue.  Lots of memories.
4969,Date of experience: August 2016,19-Dec-16,Big Ten,ohio state,4,"Would be 5 stars, but the seats are very close together","My son attends The Ohio State University, so we decided to get tickets to a late October game, before the weather really turns nasty. We were there for the game which pitted #10 Nebraska vs #3 OSU. What a fantastic atmosphere with 108,750 people in the stadium. The game itself was a blowout, with OSU winning 62-3. As for the stadium, we happened to be in one of the few covered sections, which is both good and bad. Good in that if it rains, you're protected. Bad in that it traps the heat and can get warm in that section. In addition, the seats have an obstructed view. Having been to many world class sporting events such as the Soccer World Cup, Olympics, Stanley Cup Finals, Super Bowl, etc., this was the biggest crowd I'd been part of and the logistics of getting everyone in and out was well done. Getting food and drinks (they now sell beer) was easy, although the choices were VERY limited. All-in-all a very good experience."
4970,Date of experience: November 2016,19-Dec-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,One of The Most Historic College Stadiums in the U.S.,"Gloriously historic stadium that has been updated over the years, but still holds the charm it did when I was at this school in the 80's.  Recently attended the Ohio State and Xichigan game.  My only complaint was that my daughters had to downsize their pursues due to recent security measures, so be aware of this."
4971,Date of experience: November 2016,19-Dec-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Saturday's are the best,"You have not experienced football until you have been to OSU on a Saturday. The atmosphere is amazing having been a student before. I was able to go to this past Michigan game, and the vibe that that the city got was amazing."
4972,Date of experience: November 2016,12-Dec-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Saw Ohio State beat Michigan,Wow. Ten yard line awesome view. Exciting game with great fans. Good food lots of beer stands. I might have seen the best hame ever.

4974,Date of experience: December 2016,9-Dec-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,You haven't lived until you watch an OSU football game here,"The Best Damn Band in the Land comes charging through the north entry gate to the field and 110K strong rise to sing the Buckeye Battle Cry! You are sitting in the greatest college football stadium in the country. You will see the famous Script Ohio and watch the Buckeyes batter a beleaguered opponent. The stadium is called the Horseshoe or Shoe for short, but at the South end a new modern set of South stands have been added beneath a massive state of the art scoreboards. The place was built in 1922 and is on the National Historic Register. From the outside it's impressive and you should enjoy the Rotunda on the North End with its stained glass windows and wonderful alcove. Inside it's pretty functional vs style. Bench seating is not too comfortable and you will be squeezed by other spectators. Lots of concessions are available and they now have beer available for sale. Also some Ohio food choices along with the standard fare. Even Donato's pizza. Once inside enjoy the scenery with the National Championship plaques, retired jerseys, the scoreboard, the beautiful Field Turf field, pennants waving in the breeze and the ever present state troopers standing atop the pillars at the North End"

4976,Date of experience: November 2016,7-Dec-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Always great to see Ohio State game,Love seeing Ohio State football at the stadium.  It is big but easy to get in and out.  C deck is really high up but really no bad seats.  Definitely worth a visit!
4977,Date of experience: November 2016,7-Dec-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,OSU vs Michigan Game 2016,The Shoe is an amazing place to catch a competitive college football game.  The collegiate atmosphere is awesome!
4978,Date of experience: November 2016,4-Dec-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,You've got to go for a football game,"The stadium is worth seeing empty - you can feel the history here - but for an Ohio State football game it's over the top.  Game day is a well oiled machine: friendly people will get more than100,000 people parked,  to the stadium, in the door and to their seats, refreshments in hand.  On a recent visit, I found the sound system at my seat in B-deck to be pretty bad, and they really need to invest in some bigger monitors for those who can't see the scoreboard.  But hey, you can figure out what's going on anyway,  Not to be missed."
4979,Date of experience: October 2016,3-Dec-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,WOW...,OSU football...a once-in-a-lifetime experience for me. Highest compliments to the stadium's ADA office which saved the day when we discovered our seats were actually 19 rows up....a perfect experience for my 90 year old Dad returning Buckeye.

4981,Date of experience: November 2016,30-Nov-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,"""The Game""","There is no greater rivalry in sports than ""The Game,""  the annual Ohio State-Michigan football game.  Before entering into the Shoe, one must attend event is the Skull Session held at St John's arena.  The Best Damn Band In The Land (TBDBITL) ""warms up"" for the game 2 1/2 hours before kick-off by performing their pre-game routine and half time routine.  The football team parades through on their way to the shoe with a brief speech by a player and the coach.  Get there early as seats go quickly.  This giant pep rally is a definite must see at least once."
4982,Date of experience: November 2016,27-Nov-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,OSU Michigan Game,"My first game in the Shoe and it was amazing. The record attendance was set at 110,000+ and with all those people the concessions still moved quickly and for females the bathrooms had no lines and were very clean. The men however had long lines in their bathrooms, but they seemed to move quickly. Getting into the stadium moved quickly as well and there were a TON of people trying to get in at the same time. Great staff that keeps things moving. Go bucks!"
4983,Date of experience: November 2016,26-Nov-16,Big Ten,ohio state,3,Not among the nicest stadiums,"The Shoe is not one of the nicest stadiums in the Big Ten. The walk to the upper deck is up stairs, not ramps. The angle of the upper deck seating is very severe and unsettling. The stadium is very dated. It is also full of advertising signs that flash ads, even during the National Anthem. It is nice that they serve beer in the stadium. But that can be a factor in making the already unruly Buckeye fans even more so."
4984,Date of experience: November 2016,15-Nov-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,O H I O GAME,Was a GREAT experience!  Took city bus from Crossroads that specializes in game day transport and well worth it!  Staff at the stadium was awesome.  Entered quickly through medical needs gate and easy to find public elevators for my husband.  Seats a little tight but stayed warm!!
4985,Date of experience: November 2016,15-Nov-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,The Skull Session- what you need to know.,"Now in its sixtieth year, The Skull Session is a giant pep rally, which begins 2 hours and thirty minutes before kickoff of every home game. The band will play the entire pregame and halftime performance, and the team will enter the Arena, where coach Meyer will give a brief talk.The visiting team band may also perform; and one of Ohio's premier high school bands will be performing prior to the OSU band entrance.After the band entrance, the next few minutes appear to be somewhat disorganized - as various instrument groups perform traditional ""row cheers"" , but the Session officially begins with the playing of the Navy Hymn.St. John Arena- named not for the biblical figure, but for a long-time athletic director; is the tall aluminum building located just north of the Stadium.For many games, it will be essential to arrive thirty minutes early. Try to sit in the lower level, facing or to the side of the empty chairs.Do not miss this! Long after you have forgotten the game score you will remember the Skull Session."
4986,Date of experience: October 2016,15-Nov-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Energy!!!!,We have been fortunate to be able to attend a couple games a year the past two years.  O-H; I-O and other chants in this loud stadium make this experience so worth it.  Go early.  Be prepared to pay $20 to park.
4987,Date of experience: October 2016,11-Nov-16,Big Ten,ohio state,4,Football game,"Lots of people walking to and from the game, I don't advise trying to drive to the stadium it self unless you want to wait for all the people walking to get out of your way. Very crowded, nearly sold out but so worth it! Great atmosphere and crowd cheering. Same prices for food and drinks and pro games. Small merchandise shops,  not a lot to buy. Buckeye fans only :)"
4988,Date of experience: November 2016,10-Nov-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Ohio Stadium,We went to the Nebraska game last Saturday night. We have been to the shoe many times but this was the first night game.  What an electric atmosphere. The only change they could make with selling beer would be to have separate places to buy beer so the food lines would not be so long.
4989,Date of experience: November 2016,10-Nov-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Excellent,"I've been to several Buckeye games over the years! I've also been to several away games and nothing compares to Ohio State. The atmosphere is fantastic! Plenty of restaurants and bars around the stadium and plenty of parking for tailgating. If you're looking for a great road trip to attend you've gotta experience Ohio State. The only bad thing is the food and drink prices in the stadium, eat before you go in or you'll go broke!"
4990,Date of experience: November 2016,8-Nov-16,Big Ten,ohio state,4,big 10 game,"what a neat experience. we came this past weekend for the huskers game. its a beautiful stadium. packed with tons of people. its on campus but depending on which direction you're coming from to go to the stadium. there is alot of walking. so for those who can't walk far or for a long distance, id find the shortest route to get here. the fans here are so nice. bathrooms are clean, which is good! food was good. prices aren't too high, its like any other venue price i would think. whoever comes to this stadium and the campus. its so just neat. thanks for the fun."
4991,Date of experience: November 2016,8-Nov-16,Big Ten,ohio state,4,So exciting to be in the SHOE!,"Attending a Buckeyes football game in person is one of those things you have to do at least once in a lifetime.  Tickets for the more important games are very pricey, but don't skimp like we did.  For $135 a person we got bleacher seats just 4 rows from the very top (might as well have been in the blimp in the sky above!)  We were packed in like sardines and very uncomfortable.  We did get to move down after halftime when the crowd thinned out.  However, the other fans were great -- enthusiastic, loud, sportsmanlike, and fun to be with.  We had quite a few fans in our section from the opposing team and no trouble arose -- a great time overall.  Don't miss it!"
4992,Date of experience: October 2016,8-Nov-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,A Fantastic Experience For Any Sports Fan!,"What to say that hasn't already been said?  Ohio State football is a religion and Ohio Stadium is the temple of worship.  The fanaticism and devoted fans make a visit to the Horseshoe a remarkable experience.  Be careful of certain seats in B deck.  Although you will be sheltered from the rain, if you are not sitting in the first five rows, there's a pretty good chance you will have an obstructed view of the field and there's no chance you will be able to see the big screen above the south end zone.Make sure not to miss the pep rally called Skull Session at nearby St. John Arena two hours before the game.  But you have to get there early to get a decent seat.  It's an awesome experience to see and hear the marching band up close and personal!"
4993,Date of experience: November 2016,7-Nov-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Football Weekend,Took my 16 y/o daughter to see OSU beat Nebraska.  I have a Senior and freshman daughters that attend OSU as well.  We had a great visit and really enjoyed the day.   The crowd was great and the events around the stadium and on campus were fun and enjoyable.  Big crowd so getting around became a little easier as the buckeyes pulled away.  Plenty of bathrooms and vendors to keep drinks and food flowing.  It was an exciting night.
4994,Date of experience: November 2016,7-Nov-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Just Plain Awesome,"I was here with my sons and some other guests for a nationally televised night game.  We had fantastic seats near the band.  This stadium is just plain awesome.  The scale is amazing and of course the history is wonderful.  There were 108,750 people in attendance the night of our visit.  The game was fantastic and the stadium was rocking the whole night.The concession locations were plentiful and the lines moved quickly.  The restrooms were also a plus.  What a great place to watch a football game. Highly recommended."
4995,Date of experience: October 2016,7-Nov-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,B1G Time Football Experience,"I have been to nearly every Big Ten football stadium. This is one of the best. Why?1. It's huge but still intimate. You're right on top of the field. 2. Logistics are impressive. Parking, getting people into the stadium are all top notch.3. Video screens allow you to see everything you miss with your eyes.4. Facilities are good. Lines are pretty short for both concessions and bathrooms. Impressive, considering the games have over 100,000 in attendance.5. Within striking distance of downtown. You can ride the High Street bus, get a cab or an Uber or walk (it is 3 miles though). I saw people getting Ubers within a mile of the stadium an hour after the game. Try and do that at a Northwestern game with 70,000 fewer people.6. They serve large (16oz) beers and you can buy two at a time!!!I wish we could have come home with a win, but I will happy to visit multiple times until we are successful. Go Cats!"
4996,Date of experience: November 2016,7-Nov-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,"""And I thought I didn't like football""","I challenge anyone to attend an Ohio State home football game, watch the marching band dot the ""i"", see the team run out thru their tunnel, sing the Star Spangled Banner and Carmen Ohio and not feel moved.  I grew up with my dad and brothers watching football and thinking they were insane.  Then I went to my first OSU game just several years ago, and my first night game 2 days ago and I can't wait to go back.Yes, there are over 100K people.  Yes, there are long lines.  Yes, you have to walk a long way.  But magic happens in the Horseshoe. The energy and excitement in the Shoe is like nothing I have ever experienced. Even the four Nebraska fans sitting next to us who had flown in were snapping pictures of the ""best damn band in the land"". Later they were not so enthusiastic.I will say this specific game experience had one huge negative.  This season they started selling alcohol in the stadium.  And there were a lot of very drunk people.  Two times the sherriff came to our section and arrested people.  Uncool.  And very distracting. Not sure how to handle that next time.  Kind of made me feel unsafe.But there will be a next time.  Security did their job.  The team did their job.  We did ours.  Go bucks!"
4997,Date of experience: November 2016,6-Nov-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Ohio State vs Nebraska,If you are a college football fan or a marching band fan you must attend a game in the Horseshoe.  Crowd is loud with various chants of tradition and are passionate about rhe buckeyes.  You will be astounded by the script writing by the best band in the land.  What an experience.

5003,Date of experience: October 2016,1-Nov-16,Big Ten,ohio state,3,First OSU Experience,"I am not an OSU fan, but am a fan of college football and make trips to stadiums to enjoy what different schools have to offer. Obviously, one of the most talked about venues in the sport is the Horseshoe, seating 107K at the game we went to. I have visited a number of stadiums and these are the thoughts I had about my experience at the game and with the stadium.The location of the stadium isn't the best. Non-permit parking is a decent walk away from the stadium. Get to campus early to ensure you have a spot. Getting back to the interstate after the game was a major headache. Traffic was horrible and a number of roads were closed. It took us 1.5 hours to get out of Columbus.We were given great seats by the University, which always helps the experience. We had great views of a majority of the action, but were able to see any action on the opposite side of the field on the large big screen in the South endzone. The play clocks were a little tough to see, but the rest of the signage was very well placed. When you are trying to seat 107,000 people, you are going to have to squeeze as many people as you can in. However, with all seats being bleacher style seats, this doesn't afford much room to the fans. We were in a row filled with men and it took everything we could to fit everyone in. I understand that you have to do what it takes to get lots of people in, but they could afford to give a little more space. I've been to comparable stadiums that offered more room.The fan atmosphere was nice. The student sections at each end of the field brought a lot of energy, even when the Buckeyes weren't playing particularly well. Crowd noise for 107K wasn't as loud as I expected, but still solid. The OSU band is top notch and took our game experience to the next level. The halftime show and script Ohio were some of the coolest things I've seen from a band. I haven't experienced a band that has done that well and don't expect to find one that will top it. I visited the concessions one time and spent $11 for a diet coke and a pretzel, which was higher than at most stadiums. Granted, all stadium food is overpriced; but, I still expected my money to go a little further. Lines for the restrooms were very long at halftime, but moved relatively quickly. The bathrooms themselves were less than impressive and could have used a cleaning and/or remodel. Overall, our experience was nice. Fans were nice and the atmosphere was solid. I was a little disappointed in the stadium itself. It is big, but is still in need of some updating. It seems as if OSU has been more worried about competing in the attendance battle to keep the stadium nice. I would go back for a game; but of the stadiums I have visited, it wouldn't be my first choice."
5005,Date of experience: October 2016,30-Oct-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Amazing Experience,Went to my first OSU game with my wife (alumni). The experience was amazing with the O H I O cell phone light display at the end of the game. The band did a great job with the Halloween theme. Fans stayed engaged the whole time and the food was cheap for how much nachos you received.
5006,Date of experience: October 2016,30-Oct-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,OSU vs North Western Football Game,Great stadium with a ton of spirit and updates!  And they even sell beer now:0. Plenty of restaurants and bars for tailgating!
5007,Date of experience: October 2016,20-Oct-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Everyone should go at least once,"This is a great stadium.  The vast majority of seats are excellent Unless you happen to be behind a pillar in B deck and if that happens you may have to lean one way or the other to see some plays.  The TVs in B deck are also TOO small.  They sell half the screen to advertising so the actual picture is very small and difficult to see.  If you are low enough in B deck you can see the massive scoreboard and replays on it but otherwise you have to watch on the small TVs above you.  I have  been to perhaps 250 games in my life and hope to go to another 250 games but unless it is raining, you really don't want B deck.  Always get there in time to see the Band come out as that is well worth the price of a ticket."
5008,Date of experience: October 2016,20-Oct-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Excellent,Of course this stadium is excellent!  Easy to find your way around and parking wasn't an issue.  Numerous concessions and prices were what you'd expect.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  My only compliant would be the restrooms by the end of the day were awful!  I don't think anyone was maintaining or checking them throughout the event.
5009,Date of experience: October 2016,19-Oct-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Great place to watch a game,"I know this is completely biased, but this is the best place for college football. I love rooting on my Buckeyes here! Awesome from tailgating and skull session before to all of the pregame ceremony and tradition, script Ohio, and even in the nosebleed seats that set your thighs on fire to climb to, its 100% amazing. Buckeye fans are unique, and it's great to be a part of them. It's hard to explain why spelling Ohio back and forth to each other is fun to people on the outside, but when you're part of it, there's nothing better."
5010,Date of experience: October 2016,19-Oct-16,Big Ten,ohio state,3,Great time,"Nice stadium. Loud. Fun. Joined my daughter for a game, and we had a great time. Just be prepared to stand the entire time if you're able to get into the student section."
5011,Date of experience: November 2015,19-Oct-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,"Buckeyes, Ohio State & TBDBITL","Sure, most people go for the football and I do too BUT it's being there when TBDBITL AKA The Best Damn Band In The Land comes down the tunnel, marches across the field and does script Ohio that makes the experience so much better. Or maybe singing along with Hang On Sloopy, or watching Coach Meyer and the team sing Carmen Ohio. If you've never been? It's a bucket lister if there ever was one!"

5013,Date of experience: September 2016,17-Oct-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Go Bucks!,Best place to watch a college football game period!!! Just be careful about the seat you choose.  There are seats where the view is partially blocked by a cement pillar or beam.

Had friends who played for the man). My son??s a student. I work at OSU. It??s ingrained in our blood!  If you??re wondering why it??s called the ??Shoe it??s because in its original incarnation it was indeed horseshoe shaped.  It??s been closed off and expanded over time. It??s the home of The Ohio State Buckeyes football team as well as The Best Damn Band In The Land!  You can??t beat the energy in the area on OSU home games. Enjoy the huge tailgating all around the area. You gotta go to the Bands ??Skull Sessions??.  Be respective of the opponents supporters and team, damn it! You??re representing the Bucks!  GO! Enjoy!

We got to the campus 6 hours before game time, and parked all day for $20 right across from the shoe. We got see the players entering the Field House and again as they entered the stadium before game time. It was awesome experience and hope to do it next year."
5024,Date of experience: October 2016,10-Oct-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Magnificent,"Attended the Skull Session before the football game.  The HS band that was playing and the OSU band that followed were magnificent.  We thoroughly enjoyed the music, and the OSU Drum Major was a thrill to watch, especially, the acrobatics he possesses..  During the game, the OSU marching band scripted out Ohio."
5025,Date of experience: September 2016,10-Oct-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Football game,"Parking is pathetic, especially of you are. It alumni or ""Greek"". Seating  is great all around the venue. Sound is ok and video displays enhance the visit. Food services are fair. Levy has done a fair job now that they remember this is a stadium and not a restaurant. Sad they succumbed to the pressure of alcohol sales to increase revenue."
5026,Date of experience: October 2016,10-Oct-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Great Shoe,"What can you say, it was electric to say the least, seats a bit small but that was to be expected. The stadium was packed withover 107,000,, and we won!"

5030,Date of experience: October 2016,6-Oct-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,best sporting venue in the country,"Everything about going to a Buckeyes game is like a dream come true! If you have never been to one...it's a must. From the best damn band in the land to the best damn fans in the land to the best team in the land...it is awesome. I would recommend getting to the area 3 to 4 hours early to experience everything. Walk around the stadium then head up to St. John's area for the skull session. It's free and you get to see the coach, players, and the band up close and personal. Afterwards make your way back down to the stadium, but take it all in. There are games to play for prizes, food everywhere, tailgating, and fans ready for Buckeye football. Get to your seats and watch the players warm up for a while, then get ready...it's about to get loud and you're about to have the time of your life. Best parking...go to Ohio Expo and use COTA bus transit to get to the game. $5 for parking and $5 per adult round trip to and from game. They drop you off at 17th and Neil. When you get off the bus you are looking right at the stadium! When the game is over, they pick you up at the same stop. O-H...."

It's easy access from the interstate.  They have a street there that has restaurants and OSU merchandise shops.  A pretty campus and the stadium is really awesome.  It can be seen from the interstate and you can drive to it while on the grounds.  A very attractive campus and a must visit when in Columbus.

My wife and son are Alumni. We attend when my old School Kent State plays there.Its pricey at around $75 a seat but the Electricity when the Band comes on the field is worth the price of admission ! Even though we get beat up on the field this is an experience that every Ohioan should have . Tickets are hard to come by but if you can attend one game you will always remember it!"

Seats were actually good...with the help of the large screens.  Beer is now being sold inside the stadium which has created long lines for food and beverage.

5054,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,Big Ten,ohio state,4,osu vs Tulsa game,Rain delay was a new experience during half time. I am not sure the stadium crew knew how to handle the crowd. There was no announcement except that the half time show was cancelled due to weather.  Delay for 2nd half start was not announced under the stadium.  Many food vendors were closed during the delay. The status of gate security for people leaving early and maybe coming back in was a question.  We were not aware of lightening but that was the reason for delay.

O-H--I-O
5056,Date of experience: September 2016,11-Sep-16,Big Ten,ohio state,3,Traditional but needs updated,Traditional old school college stadium and the best place ever to watch OSU football games! That being said definitely could use some renovations to the restrooms and seating. We sat under the roof on regular metal bleachers and you are so squished together with people next to you it's uncomfortable. Also the tvs under the roof are very small and would be better if they showed what's on the big scoreboard since you can't see it under the roof. One more thing is the acoustics under the roof are quite bad-you can't hear the band or the announcer so I'd suggest putting in some speakers so at least the announcer is audible. With some minor improvements still a great stadium!

The entry into the stadium was fast and efficient. The ushers at the sections are polite but some don't know what they are talking about. So retracing steps and stepping over others was necessary. The private concession stands move quickly and really hussle.   The staff at the built in stadium concession stands are lethargic.  No sense of urgency or pride in their work. The bottled water was even room temperature. Not a fan and will not use them again."

What a blast!,"OK, been living in Ohio now for 15 plus years and I just went to my first Ohio State Football game and got to finally go inside Ohio Stadium.  What an experience!  I am an Ohio State fan, watch all the games but it is nothing like going to a game in person.  I will definitely get back to more games soon.  I have been to a lot of NFL games but this was by far more fun and enjoyable!  We got there very early so we avoided a lot of the traffic getting in.  It was very slow leaving.  But with 100,000 plus fans that is to be expected.  For sure I will be back for another game!  Enjoy!  Go Bucks!"

If you go to game, go there early, see the band, take it all in.  Woody Hayes roamed these grounds...as did Archie Griffin...as did so and so and so and so.  There's so much history here, they could make a 30 for 30 just about the stadium.  I'm sure babies were born under the seats and wars were planned."
5063,Date of experience: September 2016,6-Sep-16,Big Ten,ohio state,3,Great place if you dont want a drink or food!,"This is a great football stadium rich with history and tradition.  Nearly 108k fans packed the place for the BGSU home opener.  We had great seats and a pretty good time.The biggest negative to this place is the lack of food vendors and now drink vendors.  This is the first year you can drink beer inside the Shoe.  I think this led to many issues they were not prepared for.  We waited in line the ENTIRE 2nd quarter for simply a beer and water.  When we finally got to the front of the line, they only had one type of beer left and only ten total left.  I cant image how upset the people were behind me who were not going to get service.  I have been to MANY different sporting venues and this was the worst.  I have no problem standing in line and I understand that its hard to serve 108k people, but this was a joke.  It almost seemed like they were unprepared.  In the future I think they need to add separate beer vending areas to avoid this mess, especially for those families with kids who are just wanting a hot dog and popcorn!"

The competition won't be very competitive but the pregame and halftime entertainment make up for it. Every fall hundreds of band alumni (TBDBITL) return to relive their youth. Nearly 800 band members, past and present, dot four i's for the crowd. It's the greatest tradition in college band history."
5065,Date of experience: September 2016,5-Sep-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,"Forget watching TV, get to The Shoe and get immersed in BUCKEYE FEVER!","Columbus transplant from NY 20 years.  Absolutely no way to avoid getting infected with the Buckeye Fever.  Watched games on TV until 5 years ago and then scored with season tickets. There is ABSOLUTELY nothing to prepare you for the pomp, ceremony and overwhelming crowd experience than watching a game, preferably close to the field (Sections AA). But any seat in the house will do to watch the Buckeyes play.A few tips:(1) ARRIVE EARLY (I mean at least 3 hours pre-game to find parking, and take in pregame sights, nosh and grab a few drinks).(2) Wear your Scarlet & Gray(3) Sunblock/Sunglasses & Hats during warmer/sunny days- gets' pretty bright/hot with direct sun(4) Bring/get seat cushions or reserve season seats (installed for about $70 a season)- makes a big difference so you don't have to arrive so early to ""carve out your area"".(5) Know the latests rules!  Currently no bags bigger than a small pocketbook.(6) If this is your first time there, let your surrounding fans know, they will help you ""do the right things at the right time"". Lots of traditions, but fun as heck!(7) Be prepared to stand, often!  Buckeye football is high energy!(8) Beer/Ale now on sale- but at $8-9 a pop for 1/2 sized cans- Still a win in my book(9) Layer up for fall/winter games- despite getting pumped up, the wind can howl and snow isn't unusual during the late Oct/early Nov games. Plenty of Buckeye hats, earmuffs (super important), gloves and scarves locally available pre-game(10) Charge up your phone- you WILL take a ton of photos/videos, especially during your first few games"

The stadium is a statue in itself full of memories of years past including some of the football greats.  As you get close to the stadium, you begin to hear the noise from the fans and the energy like being shot out of a cannon.  f you are in the area during football season, get tickets to Ohio State and enjoy an awesome afternoon."

Just remarkable. Last year's capacity was 104,000.  Despite the track being removed this iconic building also housed Jesse Owens' college track career. Only requirement is that you know how to spell O H I O, as well as when you hear O H as Pavlov rang his bell IMPERATIVE you respond - I O"

5073,Date of experience: September 2015,30-Aug-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,An experience well worth the cost.,"An Ohio State football game at Ohio Stadium (aka ""The Horseshoe,"" or ""The 'Shoe"") is something any college football fan should not pass up if the opportunity arises, and is anice absolute must for an Ohio State fan. Regardless of opponent, the atmosphere at Ohio Stadium is amazing. DO NOT miss the band's entrance if you've never seen it. Do NOT leave your seat at halftime and miss Script Ohio. Do hope you avoid anyone too drunk and vulgar--particulary if you are there with a kid or two."

As VP of our local Alumni Association, OSU Alumni staff ALWAYS MAKE US FEEL SPECIAL! We love volunteering for our Alma Mater and going to the games (football, basketball, hockey) is so much fun especially if there is a tailgate party involved. Over 30 years and I still get teary-eyed when the chimes sound out for ""Carmin Ohio!"" Now, we love to take our grandkids whenever we get a chance. Tickets aren't cheap but the memories are so worth it! GO BUCKEYES!"

It is old, it has been renovated and is a treasured place to watch football games with the Buckeye fans from The Ohio State University.  Whether you are a fan or not, the history in this stadium is incomparable and should not be missed.  The buckeye trees in Buckeye Grove were planted for All American players; the stadium used to be a dorm for those students returning from World War II; and over 100,000 fans watch football games there on Saturdays in the fall. Again history in the horse shoe cannot be rivaled. I have been to many stadiums, very few have the history and spirit this one has."

We shopped at the fan shops across the street and did a drive by, noticing an open gate. A gentleman motioned us in, telling us not to get on the field or run up the stairs. Turns out that he and I had a lot in common, both working games first as boy scouts and then as ushers. If you are a college football fan, this is THE place"

I do not watch any other football.  The first time I went to visit over Thanksgiving I wasn't even planning on going to the Michigan game -  after many people telling me I was crazy I got a ticket.  Stadium is beautiful and school spirit is unbeatable.  I have been to Giants stadium more times than I want to remember and college football has so much more heart and spirit.  Stadium is clean and the noise level is like nothing you have ever experienced.GO- you will not regret it!
5086,Date of experience: August 2016,12-Aug-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Impressive size,The view in person is amazing even seeing inside a completely empty house.  Much taller than it seems on tv.

5089,Date of experience: August 2016,5-Aug-16,Big Ten,ohio state,1,OVERRATED!,"I moved to Columbus 15 yrs. ago and still to this day do not understand the obsession with the Buckeyes. Even as an Alumni! Money talks! At the end of the day, that Roman stadium is a ridiculous reminder of what really matters to the school and how much revenue is being generated through the sports machine. Not to mention, getting into the stadium these days is like Fort Knox ---- give me a break!!!!!"

A unique experience.,"Ohio State is not my favorite team, but I must say there is an excitement that is generated at this stadium that is like no other. The food offerings are good and there are usually enough restrooms for men anyway that allow you to move quickly in and out.  The Horse Shoe is a sight in itself as you walk up to it and if you are going to a game the parking lots with tailgaters is a joy to see and partake if you like. The noise level and the enthusiasm of the stadium fans gets you going even if you are not a fan. It pulls you in and you just want to be part of the fun.You can get to the outside when no games are there and see the architectural designs from the original stadium!"

It is a great place without a bad seat to watch the game. There were tons of people there to watch the Buckeyes win & each of the workers I interacted with were helpful & polite. They also were constantly running shuttle busses to various parking lots, which was ultra helpful. If you like Ohio State football, you owe it to yourself to watch a game there at least once."

That makes for a lot of great memories.  So #1 - see a game in the Shoe if you can.  I also have had a fascinating tour of the Stadium.  The sky boxes, huge press box, and other aspects are all great.  Perhaps the most interesting experience is to stand on the field with this massive Roman-like structure all around you.  I certainly then understood why the Shoe is so intimidating to opposing teams made up of young men ages 18-22.  See it if you can."
5132,Date of experience: December 2015,18-May-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,A Must See,"I can't count the number of times I've been to Ohio Stadium. Simply put, if you have not been you must go. A Saturday with 110,000 crazy fans is a site to see."

The tailgating is superior to most of the schools I have been to and I am fortunate to have been to numerous stadiums of big, well known schools in all areas of the country.

Unfortunately our Buckeyes left the building the next game against Mich St. It's like no body gave a crap if they won or not. The shoe was rocking at the Blackout Game though. Not to many bad seats in this wonderful place! It's also a great place to see concerts!
5149,Date of experience: October 2015,25-Apr-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Best Stadium in College Football,"One of The greatest things to do Columbus in the fall is to attend an Ohio State Football game. They have TBDBITL(best band), best fans, best traditions, best team and best facility. The place holding over 104000 fans becomes electric! The scireboard is amazing. They have very good food selections priced in line with most other stadiums. Number and locations of bathrooms are more than adequate. They move people into the stadium fairly quickly considering extra security measures needed these days. Overall just a really fun place. Biggest drawback, the ridiculous price of the tickets for college games as well as the way students have trouble getting tickets and the way it is getting harder and harder to get alumni tickets without substantial donations on top of the exorbitant ticket prices. They continue to sell out every game so that area will not change as long as the Buckeyes show such great success. O.  H. .,,"
5155,Date of experience: October 2015,27-Mar-16,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Great field for games!,"Awesome location downtown. Get there early to park. If tailgating,  the earlier the better, especially if it's a day game."

This was the first time I'd had seats in B deck. On the plus side, we were protected from the elements. That's it. That's the only plus side, because we couldn't see much of the field,  and we were really chummy with the pipe that ran right behind us and over our heads. In fact, we both bounced our heads off that pipe.The 'Shoe _is_an amazing place to see the first ever National Champions and TBDBITL. But beware: not all seats were created equal."

5215,Date of experience: October 2015,22-Nov-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Great atmosphere,"Great atmosphere for a football game. Hard to beat anywhere else, especially if the Buckeyes win. Seats are ample size. Although they do seem smaller in B deck. Many obstructive views in B deck, but it's a great place to be when it's raining or snowing. We were in C deck this time and were quite pleased.Food offerings have improved over the past few years.Only complaint is that during football season, there is an inadequate number of men's restrooms."
5216,Date of experience: August 2015,18-Nov-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,THE BEST PLACE IN FOOTBALL,Not a bad seat in the house and the grounds are simply beautiful!

As usual in older stadiums bathrooms are small and there are not enough.  The biggest tip to offer is go very early because it gets all blocked up with 100,000 plus people trying to get in.  Our seats were great. And the biggest surprise to me in this day was that there was no security getting into the stadium.  No one checked my purse or my friends.  Give them your ticket and you get in."

5221,Date of experience: November 2015,11-Nov-15,Big Ten,ohio state,3,Average facilities,"We went to the Ohio St/Minnesota last Friday night and we had a blast. The stadium at night really puts one into an electric atmosphere. there was a chill in the air and a great night for football. It seems like the seating should be for kids cause the seats seemed smaller the higher one goes and the men's bathroom design is poor at best, way to many sinks and not enough yearnals which always causes a major backup and it's like the across the whole stadium. The women don't seem to have that problem and it's only at Ohio State all the other stadium's don't seem to make it a priority to pack as many people as they can into their facility. They could make it bigger but they'd still have the same facilties problem. The food is great and it's always a good time. They need to start doing a 50/50 like the one in Toledo Rockets stadium instead raising ticket prices every chance they get. Overall the is facility average but the Buckeye's always make it a killer event."

Ticket prices keep climbing and getting harder to get tickets.  No alcohol sold in stadium.  Prices of concessions keep climbing.  Eat and drink before you come.  Not recommended for older people to climb lots of steps and climb over lots of people to get to your west.  Dress appropriately for the weather.  100,000 of your closest friends all wedged in the shoe.  Ha ha! Go Bucks!"
5227,Date of experience: November 2015,8-Nov-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Great time,"We are die hard Buckeye Fans and we decided to fly in for the 11/7 game. It was Brutus 50th birthday celebration which I thought was cool.I looked for weeks for the best tickets and finally selected the ""B"" box seats.  Specifically 26bx-1. This section only has two short rows with folding chairs vs bleachers, plus we were right under the over hang in case of any weather issues.  Restrooms and concessions directly behind us."
5228,Date of experience: November 2015,4-Nov-15,Big Ten,ohio state,3,To Ohio 2015,"I went to see this famed stadium just because of the notoriety.  At 6:30 in the evening it was closed but there was lots of activities going on around it. Lots of students out & about, the band was practicing and people working inside the stadium.  I'll try to return soon for a game."

Got to love their green initiative and recycle program.  The energy during a game is hard to beat. I have not been in the south stands for a few years but I hope they have or will upgrade to flush toilets above the first floor.  Recently went to the OSU vs Penn state game with friends from SEC country and even they were impressed.  There is no better place to be on a fall Saturday in Ohio"
5231,Date of experience: October 2015,1-Nov-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,See it to believe it,"Great memories! It's been many years since I went to school at OSU and attended a football game here.

Bring lots of cash for concessions."

5236,Date of experience: October 2015,23-Oct-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Fantastic Night at the Horseshoe.,"There's nothing like a trip to this historic landmark on the banks of the Olentangy for a night game.

GO BUCKS!We're biased, of course, but we truly believe that Ohio Stadium is the most awesome college football stadium in America. (We've been to several large DI stadiums, even the Sugar Bowl!) The atmosphere inside Ohio Stadium is unlike anything we've experienced, and it rivals anywhere we've ever visited.The O-H-I-O chants are the best! Really, this continues to amaze us year after year!Prices are what you'd expect from a major college football stadium, but that's ok because the Buckeyes are the best! :) Restrooms (at least the women's) were clean. Ushers were very helpful and more than willing to help with seat location. We'd recommend visiting Ohio Stadium if you have an opportunity. It is unlike anything that you will ever experience."
5239,Date of experience: October 2015,21-Oct-15,Big Ten,ohio state,4,Fun environment!,Went to the OHIO VS PENN football game and it was a blast! I would recommend the environment! Saw lots of families and kids! Wear walking shoes!!
5240,Date of experience: October 2015,20-Oct-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,First time to the Shoe,Our daughter is a freshman at OSU and this was our first game.  My husband is a PSU alum so it was interesting to see the difference in the stadium atmospheres.  We enjoyed it.  Awesome band and I like some traditions that the football players have with their student fans beginning and ending the games.  Great experience.
5241,Date of experience: October 2015,19-Oct-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Fantastic Crowd Experience - Plenty of Food and Spirit!!!!,"From the laser images of Brutus outside the stadium to The Ohio State marching band, the experience is electrifying.  Food is plentiful and easy to buy in the stadium - as are clothes and souvenirs.  Just be sure to leave at least 2-3 hours to get through traffic if arriving by car.  The streets are jam packed with exuberant fans; music, food and tailgaters galore."
5242,Date of experience: October 2015,19-Oct-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Go Bucks!,"As an alumni, I still love the Shoe for the happy memories. When I now go to a football game, I go with former roommates for our reunion weekend that we have been going for over 20 years. We reconnect at the Stadium."

When the band takes the field the mood is electric!!!!!       There are Screens located so you can see every part of the game and the concession stands and restrooms are easy to find.      It makes you proud to be a Buckeye!

5246,Date of experience: October 2015,18-Oct-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,DARK NIGHT...ESPN...Fireworks and Friends...all 100k,"It should be on any Sports enthusiasts Bucket List...a game in the Horseshoe!  Day or Night, Rain or Shine but hopefully during a WIN.  From the Famed Traditions leading up to the game, TBDBITL marching over from the Skull session across the street, down thru Jesse Owens Plaza and into the Stadium. The Band performing script-ohio and O-H-I-O chants ringing the stadium.   The endless hours of tail-gating by friends and foes.  The opportunity to meet up with friends and and fans that can sing each word of Carmen OHIO, Hang on Sloopy and all those chants about the TUN.  Take a photo with Brutus Buckeye, meet an ex-player, or admire the architecture of the fabled stadium.  Young or old it doesn't disappoint the true sports fan.  Rich with history, often legends in attendance, sidelines entertain fabled players and then there is the passion of a wide-eyed freshman with a painted face.    A night game has its own special flair.  A game under the lights, a light show to entertain and fireworks to cap off each scoring event.  Make a plan to attend, at least one game, there is NOTHING like it."
5247,Date of experience: October 2015,18-Oct-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Iconic masterpiece,"Returned to the ""shoe"" for the pen state game.  It is a great mixture of great architecture and modern convenience!  Go Bucks!"

5251,Date of experience: September 2015,15-Oct-15,Big Ten,ohio state,4,Old Grand Stadium,I ran track in this stadium before the opened end was filled in. I remember the place as old and dirty. Now the improvements have done very much to the stadium.

5253,Date of experience: October 2015,14-Oct-15,Big Ten,ohio state,4,Great to be Back!,"It's been 49 years since I've been here.  It's a spirited stadium, but most of the fans were very nice.  We had an inebriated young man in front of us who kept standing up, but he didn't come back after half-time.  We were in 5B so the posts were often in the way and we couldn't see the scoreboard.  Loved the popcorn, the band, and, of course, the football team.  Go, Bucks!"
5254,Date of experience: October 2015,14-Oct-15,Big Ten,ohio state,3,O-H-I-O,"Went to my first buckeye game last weekend. The energy at and around the stadium is one of a kind. The food is horrendous in my opinion. They ran out of hot dogs and served cold ""hot"" pretzels with cold nacho cheese. The fact that they don't serve alcohol is also a downer. But you don't go for the food anyway. The seats are so crammed I was glad to get out of there. All of that being said, if you live in Columbus this is a must have experience."
5255,Date of experience: October 2015,13-Oct-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Across the Field,"Great college stadium.  Most seats are good, but some in B deck can be behind a pillar, and with the large crowds there aren't empty seats you can move to.  But it's worth it to be in a great old stadium, and see such traditions as the bands ramp entrance, Script Ohio, the O-H-I-O cheer, Buckeyes football, and Carmen Ohio."
5256,Date of experience: October 2015,13-Oct-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Buckeyes Love Their Horseshoe,"Being in The Shoe on a bright, warmer fall day was perfection.  It was a great atmosphere outside the stadium before kick off...plenty of fans...plenty of tailgaters, everyone in a happy mood.  Tickets for C Deck meant 8 flights of stairs...should have asked about the elevators.  The food & beverage selection was typical for a sports event.  I had read you could not even bring in bottled water, but we had a half full plastic bottle of coke that was allowed in.  The free shuttle system to the outer parking lots was very easy to use, not too much of a wait at all.  I might suggest avoiding traveling on 315 for game day as they had blocked off exits near the stadium."
5257,Date of experience: October 2015,12-Oct-15,Big Ten,ohio state,3,Not far from home,No game today. Here on business and had some free time. Rode pass bc I've never been here even thought I'm from Cleveland. Nice stadium. Will definitely attend a game soon

5261,Date of experience: December 2014,8-Oct-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,O-H-I-O . . . . great sports venue,"Absolutely awesome!  So much enjoy seeing The Ohio State Buckeyes playing football here.  Great seats, great activities on and off the field, the band in constant music, the cheerleaders in constant motion, script 'Ohio' and then to win is just the icing on the cake.  Lots of vendors, easy in and out. . just a great overall experience."
5262,Date of experience: September 2015,4-Oct-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,What can you say?,"Been here many times over the years for great games and hard losses and sat all over and never a complaint .

Also saw the Stones and the country jamboree here this summer. There is no finer place on an fall Saturday than the Shoe.
5265,Date of experience: September 2015,29-Sep-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Go Bucks,"The atmosphere at a Buckeye's game is unreal. Many good memories here. I try to get back to a game once a year. The student section is my favorite, but I had my first game day experience with the rest of the crowd this past Saturday, and it was a blast. The people we sat by were obviously a tight-knit group, but they were so friendly. Also, they taught me a new tradition I might have to adopt--post touchdown chocolate chip cookies. They share them with the people they sit by. Definitely a good experience, especially for a big win!"
5266,Date of experience: December 2014,29-Sep-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Great College Stadium,"Watched the OHSAA Division 1 State Football Championship Game here.  Beautiful stadium, all of the seats feel like your are very close to the field."
5268,Date of experience: September 2015,28-Sep-15,Big Ten,ohio state,4,The shoe,Have been to the shoe multiple times over the years for games. Neat old school stadium. With 106k people you feel a bit crammed when watching the game but it is all part of the experience. No better pregame experience than watching the OSU marching band perform and spell out script Ohio.
5269,Date of experience: September 2015,28-Sep-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Best damn team in the land!,"This is truly one of the most beautiful and amazing stadiums in the country. tOSU offers the usual stadium fare such as hot dogs, brats, nachos, etc., they don't sell any beer or alcohol. If you're sitting in B deck be aware of possible obstructed views due to the large support poles supporting C deck. In addition to the beauty of the exterior, if you go here, you will see the best damn band in the land as well as the national champion Ohio State Buckeyes!"
5270,Date of experience: September 2015,28-Sep-15,Big Ten,ohio state,4,A true party time,"I went to see my school, Northern Illinois,  play OSU in football. I'll talk about the experience,  this not being a sports column. OSU fans take their team seriously.  I have been to big time schools in other places and OSU is serious big time football and partying. First, like most programs that started in the horse and buggy area, get their early, like 4 hours early,  or don't count on parking anywhere near the stadium. The stadium holds over 100,000 fans, so count on lots of people everywhere. Like most large college towns, you will find lots of eating and drinking spits in the area. Some provide sidewalk service. So possibly nothing I have said so far sounds different than other big time college destinations? It's the sheer magnitude of thousands of people and hundreds of party locationns. Then you enter the stadium itself and are hit by the size and the history if the place, which is displayed everywhere. Every college has its special traditions. Get there early enough to go in the basketball arena next to the football stadium and listen to the marching band pregame concert, which is free. There had to have been over 10,000 people listening. Of course, the pregame marching band, spelling Ohio on the field is special and should not be missed. Why did I rate it ""4""? Big time college football tickets are getting very expensive. The city of Columbus is not well built streetwise for big events, so expect lots of time in traffic. But for a once-in-a-lifetime experience, it is worth it."
5271,Date of experience: September 2015,28-Sep-15,Big Ten,ohio state,3,Beautiful stadium but cramped seating.,"The seats are extremely cramped.  I had my husband on one side and a stranger on the other side who was taking up half of my seat and I couldn't move.  They need to renovate and make a little more room for the fans so we can enjoy the game a little more, and I'm not a big girl.  Also beer sales should be for the entire stadium not just a select few.  Not all of us tailgate before the game."
5272,Date of experience: September 2015,28-Sep-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Gotta go at least once,If you're a Buckeye fan you need to go here at least once. The Stadium is very large and neat to be walking around on game day. Once inside you can tell it was built long ago and that's part of what makes it interesting. I've got to say the seating leaves a bit to be desired. Most if not all (I think) is bleachers. You had better like the person next to you because you're going to be CLOSE. Other than that if you're a fan you'll love watching in person.
5274,Date of experience: September 2015,22-Sep-15,Big Ten,ohio state,4,Nothing Like A Day At The Horseshoe,"It is a sea f red on football Saturdays in Columbus. The stadium is called ""The Horseshoe"" because it was shaped like a horseshoe, open at one end. A renovation closed it, adding more seats. It is quite an experience to be there with 100,000 other people watching the 2014 National Champion Ohio State Buckeyes. The band's ""Script Ohio"" is a special treat."
5275,Date of experience: September 2015,21-Sep-15,Big Ten,ohio state,3,Tunnel vision,"First off let me start by saying I am a big Buckeyes fan. We went to the home opener. Such a very cool experience....however, we were in B deck towards the back (row 17). I had heard all seats in the stadium are good but it's just not true. We couldn't see the score board and had tunnel view. The seats are very close together and we all basically had to take turns (in our row) standing up because we all didn't fit. Luckily, there were some open seats in the section next to us. I would go again, but will never sit in B deck again."
5276,Date of experience: September 2015,20-Sep-15,Big Ten,ohio state,4,Old school feeling.,"It's kind of like walking into the bowels of the earth.  Big, grey, cement.  Our seats were almost at the top of the horseshoe and they were great seats.  I was shocked I could see so well.  Of course, it's steep.  If you have balance problems think twice about walking up tiny cement steps.  Our knees were very close to the people in front of us.Food:  average and of course, pricey.  To watch OSU play football cost around $200.  We parked at the fair grounds for  $5 and paid around $6 each to ride the shuttle.  The return shuttle line was extremely long, but went quickly.  Because of traffic, the ride to the fair grounds was 40 minutes long."
5277,Date of experience: September 2015,20-Sep-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,The Shoe is the best for sports viewing,"I have been attending OSU football games in the Horseshoe for over 40 years.  Even graduated twice in the stadium.  I find it a very accessible stadium for vending, restrooms, and overall comfort.  The stadium staff is very helpful in getting you to your seats.  Is it a plush accomdation-no-it is a football stadium for over 105,000 people to cheer the Buckeyes on.  If you ever get a chance to attend a concert or football game there, take the time as it is a wonderful experience.  As one looks around and the crowd is going O-H-I-O it is amazing."
5278,Date of experience: October 2014,19-Sep-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Great environment even for visitors,"Ohio Stadium is the largest venue that I have ever seen a sporting event in. However, it did not feel like an overlarge stadium. It was quite a nice place to watch a game (but maybe that had to do with the incredible seats that we had.)The fans were loud and boisterous but not unwelcoming. Even the loudest among them congratulate us on our win after the game.I will note the traffic around the stadium looked terrible. We were staying at B&B a mile from the stadium and as we were walking back, we were traveling faster than the cars."
5280,Date of experience: October 2014,15-Sep-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,First OSU game,"Atmosphere is amazing. fans fun and friendly. Got to tail gate and best social experience ever. Stadium has a lot of stairs, crowed elevators so be patient but greatest experience ever, a must do if you get the chance.. OSU band is amazing"
5281,Date of experience: September 2015,10-Sep-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Best college football experience,"Seeing a game at Ohio Stadium is an amazing experience.  The fans are friendly and welcoming.  It is easy to get in and out of if you plan ahead.  The festivities before and after the games are fun, classy and traditional."
5282,Date of experience: September 2015,9-Sep-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Atmosphere like no where else.,"There is nothing like game day at The Shoe.  108,000 fans rooting for the Buckeyes!  Script Ohio, Brutus Buckeye, the Jumbotron, The Best Damn Band in the Land, and of course, the best team in the nation.  Massive tailgating, food trucks, block parties, corn hole, not to mention the pre-game Skull Session to hear the band play their half time show at St John Arena.  Great fans,"
5283,Date of experience: October 2014,9-Sep-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Go Bucks !,"Love Ohio stadium , The shoe !! If you want to have a  great college game experience look no further.  It is a beautiful stadium and it helps the fact that we also have a Great college team and watching the band is incredible, even if you are not a fan of bands you will love The Ohio State band !"

TBDBITL, Hang on Sloopy, Skull Sessions, and more. Awesome place for the Bucks to play. Go Bucks.  If your seat is in C deck, be prepared for a walk."
5285,Date of experience: August 2015,6-Sep-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Huge...,"As stadiums go, this one is truly amazing. I was impressed with the architecture of the beautiful entrance, never mind how vast the space is inside the walls. We did not attend a game this time but felt we needed to stop by while visiting Columbus for the first time..."
5286,Date of experience: September 2015,4-Sep-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,It's THE SHOE!! What's not to love!,"Watching the Buckeyes is always a pleasure but doing it from within the stadium is amazing!The crowd are passionate fans who love their team. They are welcoming to visiting fans and treat everyone with respect.The view of the field is fantastic no matter where you sit, no poles or balconies blocking your view.There are plenty of bathrooms and food stalls located around making any trip from your seat quick and easy!"
5287,Date of experience: October 2014,1-Sep-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Get Atmosphere,Great energy and a fantastic place to see a game. Been here several times and always a joy. Go bucks.......
5288,Date of experience: August 2015,31-Aug-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,The shoe!,"Home of the best college football team in the USA!  Ohio Stadium is simply the best.  Always a great time here watching the game, tailgating, or whatever.  Best place to be for our yearly BEATDOWN of that school up North."
5289,Date of experience: August 2015,29-Aug-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,OSU,This is the Mecca if you are a Buckeye or college football fan in general. I got goosebumps my first time walking in. Unbelievable venue. Go Bucks!
5290,Date of experience: November 2014,25-Aug-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,THE BEST PLAVE EVER!!,"We love to go and support our hometown team, THE OHIO STATE BUCKEYES!! Its a beautiful stadium and the atmosphere with all the fans cheering, the smell of food in the air, and the band playing throughout is one of the best experiences of our lives!  We will continue our tradition of visiting the Ohio Stadium until we can no longer get up the stairs to our seats!!"
5291,Date of experience: September 2014,24-Aug-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Thrilling!,"From the moment you step into the 'Shoe, the excitement begins.  From the sound of the drums as the band proudly marches into the stadium, to the essential singing of the OSU alma mater, ""Carmen Ohio"" at the end of every football game, there is no place as thrilling as The Ohio State University football stadium.  A visit to the home of The Buckeye when in Columbus is highly recommended!"
5293,Date of experience: August 2015,22-Aug-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Parking,Found it best to park a little further away from stadium so it's easier to get back on a main road and away from  traffic.
5294,Date of experience: October 2014,21-Aug-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Wonderful Stadium - GO BUCKS!!,"I'm a Buckeye, so I'm pretty biased, but Ohio Stadium (also known as the Horseshoe, or the Shoe), is amazing. It is hands down the best place to watch college football. The facility is huge and updated, and the scoreboard is enormous. The fans are enthusiastic, to put it mildly. There is plenty to eat here too, but make sure to be in your seats for halftime...because that is when you get to see The Best Damn Band In The Land, which you don't want to miss. GO BUCKS!!!"
5297,Date of experience: September 2014,18-Aug-15,Big Ten,ohio state,3,Impressive structure,"Impressive from the outside, especially the architecture. However, you can only walk around it (unless it's open for the public inside)."
5298,Date of experience: September 2014,15-Aug-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Ohio Stadium is the place to be for Football Saturdays,"If you are lucky enough to experience the thrill of live Ohio State Football and the absolutely outstanding band, then this Stadium will be on you list of lifetime experiences. The crowd on fall saturdays holds 100,000 rabid OSU fans. With pregame tailgating; selected party venues outside the stadium and the crisp Ohio autumn weather-you can count on an experience unlike any other!"
5299,Date of experience: October 2014,13-Aug-15,Big Ten,ohio state,4,"If the 'Shoe fits, enjoy it","Football, lacrosse, musical events are of course, a cluster.  Personally, I would rather stay home than be relegated to C deck.  Viewing is pretty good from anywhere, but bleachers are outmoded and uncomfortable for four hours unless you are among the lucky ones who have season tickets and installed seats with backs.  Those with mobility problems can take elevators.  The atmosphere at football games is electric and with any luck, you won't have some idiot/s in the vicinity.  The band is always fantastic.  Parking is a PIA.  Food is mediocre.  Stadium could use some more upscale offerings mixed with the traditional pizza and hotdogs."
5300,Date of experience: November 2014,13-Aug-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Brilliant Atmosphere,Brilliant State University and well worth a visit. With its iconic Shoe. tremendous game day atmosphere. I was a member of the largest attendance ever and it was a joy. The best stadium in college football!
5301,Date of experience: August 2015,11-Aug-15,Big Ten,ohio state,1,WOW!!!,"Wow!  I was SO underwhelmed.  It was talked up to me so much.  I've only lived in Columbus for 3 years so I'm not a fan, but I appreciate athletic venues.  I could not have been less impressed than I was at this stadium.....waste of time quite frankly."
5302,Date of experience: December 2014,8-Aug-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Great football atmosphere,I have been attending games here since 1954 and it has always been a great experience.  Love the atmosphere and everyone should go at least once in their lifetime.
5303,Date of experience: October 2014,4-Aug-15,Big Ten,ohio state,2,It's a stadium...,"Big whoop. The expansion done back in 2000 makes it look as though it's wearing dentures. If you are going to an event, it's a well run venue. If you are a die-hard Buckeye, then you'll have died and gone to heaven. For the rest of us, it's just a stadium."
5304,Date of experience: October 2014,28-Jul-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Not a horseshoe any longer,"I am old enough to recall when the south end was open, before bleacher seats and the massive scoreboard was added.  The stadium is a great example of architecture from the 1920's, and still has student dorm rooms inside the massive structure! If you can afford the ticket prices, plan to attend a Buckeyes game here. You won't be disappointed."
5305,Date of experience: November 2014,24-Jul-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Game Day in Ohio Stadium,Being in the Stadium during a football game is magical. You aren't just watching a ball game but see so many things happening in the stadium.Seeing the half-time show is worth the price of the ticket to get in. The Best Damn Band in the Land..The Best Damn Football Team in the Land and the Best Damn Fans in the Land.
5311,Date of experience: November 2014,11-Jul-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Ticket or not it's the place to be on game day!!,The atmosphere out side is highly charged! I love that tailgates are steps away from the entrances. Ohio State fans are the best fans!!
5313,Date of experience: October 2014,9-Jul-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Best football stadium in the Big Ten,Exciting venue to see sports. Great views and scoreboard. Nothing compares to seeing the OSU marching band do the Script Ohio. Also you get to see the number one team in America. Go Bucks!
5314,Date of experience: November 2014,8-Jul-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Football,Saturday afternoons in The Shoe are incredible! It is loud and an experience you should try if you are a fan of College Football!
5315,Date of experience: November 2014,7-Jul-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,O-H-I-O,There is nothing like going to an OSU game.  The band the crowed the always wining thing.  If you are a fan and you haven't been to a game..... go to a game.  If your not a fan then.... go to a game so you can be a fan.  *ichigan sucks.
5317,Date of experience: September 2014,2-Jul-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,College football history,"My wife is from Ohio and crazy Buckeyes fan so we had to go for a game. The stadium is massive and its scarlet and grey everywhere, it's one of the best college football environments you can go to."
5318,Date of experience: August 2014,1-Jul-15,Big Ten,ohio state,4,Great football,"If you love Ohio State football you have to go the stadium to see a game. It's a whole different experience than watching it on tv. Seats are a little too close to be comfortable but more seats the more people the more noise to quiet down that team from up north."" As Woody would say"""
5319,Date of experience: October 2014,1-Jul-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Amazing Atmosphere!,"We love to see our buckeye's at home!  The food is great (Panera is my favorite), the workers are friendly.  The shops are nice to add items to our OSU collection.  We have gone to movie nights in the summer as well.  A lot of upgrades have been made in the last couple of years. Love the stadium all around!"
5322,Date of experience: November 2014,25-Jun-15,Big Ten,ohio state,1,Over rated,"This establishment is overrated.  It is big, noisy and the people act like drunken bums.  I refuse to go to another game at Ohio Stadium, that is not my dream game."
5327,Date of experience: December 2014,22-Jun-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,BEST TIME EVER!!!!,This is the most hype stadium I have ever been too including NFL .. the layout allows you to view everything and be a apart of all the action. The vendors are great and offer soooo much. The security is awesome  !!!  The Band yes please my niece is in love .
5331,Date of experience: November 2014,11-Jun-15,Big Ten,ohio state,2,"Seen one Stadium, You've Seen Them All","Unless you're one of those unfortunate individuals who bleed scarlet and grey, seeing Ohio Stadium empty is a yawner."

IO!Is there any other place in the country that will draw 99,000 people for a spring game...I think not!The excitement in this place on gameday only rivals that of some soccer stadiums in Europe...make sure that you get a night game (way more exciting).  If looking for tickets, ""C"" deck in the lower area is the best location (under 20 rows).Game on!"
5339,Date of experience: November 2014,3-Jun-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,the SHOE,The best place to see the Ohio State Buckeyes football team. we have been to multiple games each year. tickets are available in the preseason but harder to get during the big ten schedule
5341,Date of experience: November 2014,3-Jun-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Love Ohio Stadium,"We have gone to many Buckeye football games in Ohio Stadium. There are many great seats but do check a seating chart before you buy tickets. The stadium has typical stadium food, but no beer. If rain is predicted, bring/buy a poncho because umbrellas are not permitted in the stadium. Security will check your bags and purses. Go Buckeyes!"
5350,Date of experience: November 2014,26-May-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,GO BUCKS!,"This is a place where we go see our home team, the OSU Buckeyes play.  Always a great experience.  The band is great.  Script Ohio is awesome.  The seats are all good and the players look much larger in person than they do on TV.  Nice scoreboard as well  FIVE STARS!"
5351,Date of experience: November 2014,19-May-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,GO Bucks,"Everyone should attend a football game in Ohio Stadium at least once in their lives.  Game atmosphere is great.  The band, cheerleaders, even the raising of the American flag are exceptional experiences.  Go to the Alumni game early in the season and you'll see four script Ohio's at once.  The half-time shows are played to a full stadium.  No one leaves at half-time until the band is done.  Two big screens show replays.  There are fireworks at night games after a score.  Lots of tailgating and family fun outside of St. John arena as well before the game.  New food choices for concessions make it a decent place to eat.  Bring $$ for concessions and souvenirs.  And whatever you do - wear scarlet and grey!"
5352,Date of experience: December 2014,15-May-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Best Damn Stadium in College Football - The Horseshoe at OSU,"Officially called ""Ohio Stadium"" but called the ""Horseshoe"" or just the ""Shoe"" by the OSU students, I have seen many football games with over 104,000 of my closest friends at the Horseshoe - in the snow, in the rain, and in the heat of an unusually warm Fall day.  Yes, they put a set of bleachers to close off the Horseshoe shape, but they don't touch the original Horseshoe, so it is still a Horseshoe Stadium. The seats are just numbers on concrete, so bring a stadium chair and the chair will also help you from being crushed as people from different rows wanting to sit with friends or closer to the action will invade your row and squeeze you in.  The Horseshoe is also the home of the BDBITL - the Ohio State University Marching Band - one of the finest marching bands in the world so you don't want to miss their half-time show.  It alone is worth the price of a ticket which is excessively high unless you are an OSU student.  One interesting note, there is a cinder track and field track circling the football field that is named after Olympian and OSU athlete Jesse Owens."

5370,Date of experience: September 2014,17-Mar-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,"You Have to Experience It to ""Get It""","Going to an Ohio State football game is an experience for the senses.  The tradition, the color, the band, the football team, the fans - it's an amazing experience.  Take your wallet though.  Everything to eat or drink is super expensive.  We have paid $7 for a bottle of water.  I don't know why they have to gouge the fans.  No matter - it's an experience!"
5371,Date of experience: September 2014,6-Mar-15,Big Ten,ohio state,4,Iconic,"One of the great venues in college sports. The additional seating makes the place seem very cozy for a stadium that seats 100,000+."
5372,Date of experience: September 2014,1-Mar-15,Big Ten,ohio state,4,"Fun time, great team!","It's ""The OHIO STATE""! What can I say? It's an older stadium, with fairly good access and parking. Could have better food options. Could improve bathrooms. But at the same time, kinda like going to Wrigley Field....do I really want to change any of that? No."
5374,Date of experience: November 2014,24-Feb-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,THE Horseshoe is epic,Watched The Ohio State Buckeyes beat the wolverines here.  Even was on the field after the game.  This is what College Football is all about.  Stadium has it all.  It is a must go see in person type of place.  I will be back
5375,Date of experience: January 2015,22-Feb-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,The iconic Shoe,"If you love college football, this has to be on your bucket list. Game day at the shoe is an event. Plan on spending 4-6 hours before kick off taking it in. Whether you want to enjoy the tradition of the Skull session, entrance of the best damn band in the land, the raising of the Flag, the O-H-I-O cheer, or hang on Sloopy and Carme Ohio, or having a cold one with some friends- any time spent here is unforgettable."
5376,Date of experience: October 2014,19-Feb-15,Big Ten,ohio state,1,If you are a visiting fan of the opposing team - don't bother.,"In 40+ years of attending college football games, Ohio Stadium is easily the worst place for fans of opposing teams to attend.  Far surpasses WVU as most hostile and ignorant.  I have been to every Big Ten venue and this takes the prize for most awful (No I am not a Michigan fan).  If you are taking your family: beware.  They have no shame in yelling most obscene and vulgar comments at even children.  Truly awful."
5377,Date of experience: November 2014,18-Feb-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Where Champions play,A well known icon in the Columbus area.  Easy to get into and out with Rt 315 nearby.  So much history is represented there.
5378,Date of experience: November 2014,18-Feb-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Best Stadium EVER!,"We went to a football game and as always, the stadium was packed and soooo much fun. Lots of Alumni and their families, and grandkids go too, and the atmosphere is electric. I absolutely love the OSU Marching Band, and everybody in the stadium is so friendly, even while watching the game. Who knew at that game that we would go to win the National Championship!Can't wait to go there again for my son's graduation this May. Super Stadium!"

Lots of seeing 108.000 for those who can get tickets.  The spirit and the fans are over the top.  Not many stadiums have the history that the SHOE has.
5380,Date of experience: October 2014,18-Feb-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,The Show,"Best Dang Place to watch a football game.  Even after going to games there for the past 15 years, I still get chills when you walk into the grand old stadium.  From watching the band take the field and doing Script Ohio to cheering the Buckeyes onto victory and ending with the singing of Carmen Ohio, it's an experience you'll want to come back and enjoy time and time again.  GO BUCKS!!!"
5381,Date of experience: November 2014,18-Feb-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,First trip to the Shoe !,"We went to see a football game which turned out to be a blowout vs Illinois , so not exactly the most amazing game of this 2014 amazing National Championship season.  All of the other traditions and cheers and the marching band helped make up for it though. Our seats were purchased through a different website and were pretty expensive ( $200+ Each) , but the view was pretty great."
5382,Date of experience: September 2014,18-Feb-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Nothing like an Ohio State home game!,"My son & I go to a game for our birthdays every September.  Its an amazing experience no matter who the opponent!  Watching the band do script Ohio and dotting the ""I"" gives me shivers every time.  Stadium is right on campus and its great to show up early & tailgate or just walk around the stadium in all that Scarlet & Gray!  Its really expensive to sit in the good seats especially if you don't have season tickets but its worth every penny.  Its a lot more expensive for the big ten games so if you don't mind go early in the season to one of the non league games. Food is pretty good at the stadium but you get into long lines at the game. If you sit in the club seats you have access to the club level food. Thats realy nice but again not cheap. Of course how great is it that we are the 2014 National Champions!!!"
5383,Date of experience: November 2014,18-Feb-15,Big Ten,ohio state,4,A must see experience,"Attending an Ohio State Football game is always a fun time.  The campus in the fall is breathtaking and then add 108,000 people in the stadium is icing on the cake.  Get there early to watch the OSU Marching Band ramp entrance into the stadium.  The precision is fantastic and the then the crowd goes crazy when the Drum Major runs out of the tunnel and onto the field.  The band halftime shows are amazing.  Oh, and there's a national championship football team that also shares the field with the band too.  Good times."
5385,Date of experience: November 2014,18-Feb-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Best venue in College Football,"I've been to many college games around the country and although I am undoubtedly biased as a Buckeye, the ""Shoe"" is an unquestionable classic!

5387,Date of experience: November 2014,28-Jan-15,Big Ten,ohio state,4,The most exciting place for Ohio college football!,This is a huge impressive stadium.  We were there on a cold evening game.  We were fortunate to be shielded from the wind by the press box and nearby wall but it was still very exciting and festive.  I get this feeling every time I go here! The only downside is the seating is so tight it is sometimes uncomfortable for how you are pressed in like sardines but  I love the Buckeyes so I keep going back!  Go BUCKS!!!
5388,Date of experience: January 2015,24-Jan-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Went to celebrate a National Championship Victory!,"Loved every minute. It was freezing but they can't control the weather. The Ohio State Buckeyes have the best damn fans, band, team and coaches in the land! Go Bucks!"
5389,Date of experience: January 2015,20-Jan-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,A must visit!!,"This is an iconic structure not just in central Ohio, but also the US.

5392,Date of experience: October 2014,1-Jan-15,Big Ten,ohio state,5,What can you say about a Buckeye's game?,"I am a graduate of THE Ohio State University but attending a game is an exciting experience. The band, the enthusiasm, the grandeur of it all. Quite an experience.My two suggestions......go to an October game and be sure to go to the ""skull session"" that the band holds in nearby St John's. Tremendous spirit and the great tradition that goes with a great band.A cold game in Nov is not a lot of fun especially if it is raining, snowing, or freezing.Don't think you will be disappointed."
5393,Date of experience: December 2014,8-Dec-14,Big Ten,ohio state,5,First time there and not disappointed!,Our first time to the stadium and it was awesome!

The TEAM, the BAND, the FANS, the WINS,...the few losses. The many people I have taken to games all reflect the same thoughts,(BY FAR, THE BEST SPECTATOR SPORTS EXPERIENCE THEY'VE EVER HAD!) The atmoshere around the stadium stretches for several miles, with the tailgating, the banners, the vendors, music and foods. The Band,(TBDBITL--which stands for The Best Damn Band In The Land), makes their ramp entrance; the National Anthem is played; THE GAME IS PLAYED, (about 90% victories at home), and at the end of the game Carmen ,Ohio; the alma mater is sung by everyone, and then home. A PERFECT DAY, IN A PERFECT PLACE, WHERE EVERY BUCKEYE FAN LOVES EVERY BUCKEYE FAN! Go see OHIO STADIUM, and go to any game you canI OH-IO, GO BUCKS!"

Bad planning, 3rd quarter no coffee, no hot cocoa, all they had was soda and popcorn.  Tickets are over priced nose bleeds for $150 per seat face value.  Went for the nostalgia but will likely not return, too expensive!  Not family friendly, the fans are not considerate of youth..."
5400,Date of experience: September 2014,24-Nov-14,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Football at its Finest,"This is what football is all about. This stadium encompasses all that is great with the game of football: atmosphere, tradition, rivalries, and great games. The moment you make your way in, you feel like a part of history. They have done some updating, but for the most part, an old school football stadium still lives here. Don't be surprised if you park a mile away. This is THE Ohio State University and these games draw some of the biggest crowds. People will tailgate for hours around the horseshoe. I'd recommend getting a bleacher back if you are not used to sitting in bleachers. Enjoy the halftime show by the BEST DAMN BAND IN THE LAND, and stay through to the VERY end of the game. You won't be disappointed."

Unfortunately, the weather had freezing rain, and many of the highways were slick and icey.  Even part of Rt. 71 was closed.  We stayed the night before to make our jouney easier, unbeknownst to us that the weather would be treacherous in the morning.  We traveled slowly and had no trouble.  We parked off of Ackerman Rd next to Jesse Owens field.   Parking is $15 and open to the public.  It is a bit of a walk, and under the icey conditions, not much fun.  The tailgaiting lots were very scant compared to usual.  Heard the band at St. Johns warm up and walked over to the stadium.  With the ice, the steps and seats were slick.  Possibly they could have done a better job at salting the areas.  The game was touch and go, but OSU did win.  All in all, a fun experience."

(Usually referred to as ""The Shoe"" around Columbus.)  The sounds of the stadium are amazing. Even if you're NOT a football fan, it is a unique cultural experience that you will not soon forget. I wish at my senior-citizen age that I could still sit in stadium bleachers, but although I cannot, I have wonderful memories of times at the horseshoe watching our Buckeyes take the field.  If you go, do not miss the ""Skull session"" which happens a few hours before kickoff.  It's at St. John's Arena. (Check before you leave home.)  It was originally a time for the band to practice without their music but it has become a much-valued pep rally and usually the team and coach come in for a big cheer.  Don't miss it!Enjoy your time at The Ohio State University and...  GO BUCKS!!"
5407,Date of experience: December 2013,10-Nov-14,Big Ten,ohio state,5,OSU Stadium,"This stadium has been around a LONG TIME b/4 I was born.  I am only 80, so you know that has been a long time. I can't count the number of times it has been updated. I have been in stadiums from coast to to coast and this one stays in the top 10 as far as I can see. It used to be called the ""Horse Shoe"" as that was the shape. No longer a ""Shoe"" the open end was filled in to seat approx 1000 more spectators. Entrance and exit is very efficient, I got out and was down-town eating at Florentine's Restaurant in less than 30 mins. You must see this at least ONCE, I think!  AND the ""Best Band in in the land"" adds to the attraction."

Of course, the football game is the event, but Ohio State is the reason.  The experience of returning to campus, getting caught up in the infectious energy that oozes youth and vigor, is good for this older soul - old enough to know the original version of ""Hang On Sloopy"" by the McCoys. So much more than football - the buildings, old and new, the libraries, the paths, the smells, the bars, the memories, THE STADIUM.  So, as we work our way, in semi-ritualistic fashion, from Eddie George's to Long's, to the OutrInn, and then west toward the stadium, the anticipation builds.  Eat one (or two) hot dog(s) with Stadium Mustard before emerging into the ""Shoe"" which so represents the coming together of generations for generations.  One knows they are in the middle of Ohio, the heartland of America, as well as at the epicenter of college football. Not a bad way to spend a day in this ephemeral thing we call life.  GO OHIO."

I could care less about sports, but I figured it'd be something cool to see as we attended a private arts college and didn't have the ""real"" college experience. It was soo much fun! The stadium is huge and our seats were really great! The fans are amazing! It was fun to watch everyone spell out ""O-H-I-O"" in the wave. The Marching Band was really great too and it's super cool to see them spell out ""Ohio"" in script form."

Facility was easy to find, easy to get in and out of, clean bathrooms, and the usual expensive food.  Big score board for watching game replays.  Great acoustics for the band!  A little difficulty hearing the refs, so may need to work on that system. The only really negative for us was how packed in we were.  Small spaces for sitting, felt a little like sardines."

I had to stop and take a picture. I had never been on or even NEAR the field of a college or professional sporting arena. It was mind blowing...just imaging having people in all those seats cheering...wow. It was an AWESOME way to push me to finish the race.

It seats over 106,000 people but doesn't seem crowded because the ushers and other security personnel are goo at what they do.  The food is typical of stadium food and if you go to get food at halftime, you will have a long wait in line.  Great time, great excitement, and a great football team."

The new Tunnels add some cover for the visiting teams and add to the overall experience of running out onto the field for the first time to see a sea of Scarlet and Gray clad fans. Ticket prices are still considered high by some but as long as the Bucks win. I don't really care. I think it separates the people that actually want to see a football game from the basketball fans.. OSU should allot more Student tickets to the games and allow them to sit as close to the field/court as possible. Playing OSU at any sports team at home should intimidate opponents, coaches and impress their fans. New seating is a step in the right direction."

I was a photog for the school and saw all home games in the stadium for four years from the sidelines or the press box. The Sept. 27 game against Cincinnati was only the second time I experienced the ""real"" Ohio Stadium experience by buying a ticket, standing in lines and watching the game from the seats. I was apprehensive because my first attempt at doing so several years ago was quite a painful experience. However, I loved the experience this time. Everyone from the ushers to the ticket takers to the police were fun, polite and effective. The place was clean and I was very impressed with the various food offerings in concessions. The scoreboard was easy to watch and the re-plays shown were great. Now, if NCAA would lift any sanctions on beer sales, it would be that much of a greater experience."

Ohio State Marching Band is the best in the land. The red coats (actually they wore white shirts) tOSU ushers were amazingly helpful. What I did not like was catching a cab after game and being dropped off several blocks from stadium even though my wife is disabled. Driver claimed Lane Avenue was closed to traffic. He lied. The taxi commission in Franklin County or Columbus needs to look into this. They definitely need to improve exiting and picking up a taxi especially for out of town disabled fans.

Football here is insane and is matched by a usually incredible halftime performance from The Ohio State University Marching Band. The huge student section taking over the South Stands creates an electric vibe that can be felt throughout the entire stadium.

5466,Date of experience: November 2013,24-Nov-13,Big Ten,ohio state,4,A Splendid Football Temple But Not What It Once Was,"One really can't argue that this isn't one of the ten most impressive outdoor arenas in America.  The game-day experience here, including the outstanding marching band, is hardly equaled anywhere else.  You really should see it if you??re anywhere near Columbus.  I will note, however, that this stadium is a rather ugly shadow of its former self since the renovation that occurred in 2000-01.  I say that having grown up in it and having toured every one of the top college football stadiums in the U.S. except for Florida's and Auburn??s.    I spent my childhood watching OSU football games from Section 17B in the Horseshoe during the '70s and early '80s when it still had an open end with relatively small bleachers, the sheltered B-deck still existed and hadn't been eliminated in favor of luxury boxes, and the track on which Jesse Owens ran still surrounded the playing field.  I've been back several times since 2001 and, although the crowd is much closer to the field and much noisier because the open end of the stadium has been virtually closed and C-deck raised, the place leaves me cold.  The grand bell tower in the southeast end of the stadium has been virtually smothered by the construction around it.  The ""bleachers"" in the south end are gigantic, grotesque and completely at architectural odds with the horseshoe portion of the stadium.  They really should have simply enclosed the stadium and made it a bowl.It's certainly fun to sit in A-deck now and watch a game because the crowd is literally on top of you compared with how it used to be.  But go to the upper reaches of C-deck and whoa!  We might as well be watching the game in a bar or at home.  I understand the drive for revenue and increased seating.  And certainly if you're one of the 20,000 more people who can attend each game compared with the '80s you're not complaining.  The problem, however, is that this stadium was architecturally very special when it was built.  Begin with a nondescript bowl, such as Michigan or Notre Dame Stadiums, and it's not really visually jarring to add on to the top of it.  When the university did so to Ohio Stadium, however, it really ruined a magnificent temple.  By all means go and visit, particularly if you can attend a game.  It??s a true modern Colosseum.  But before you do look up some old photos of the stadium from the '70s, early '80s or even the mid '90s to see what it looked like before it was ruined.  When I see it today I'm reminded of a classically beautiful human being who has ravaged himself with poorly-executed plastic surgery."
5467,Date of experience: September 2013,14-Nov-13,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Great experience,"Went for the OSU - Wisconsin State game. This was my first college game experience at a stadium (and tailgating.)  All staff were very friendly, a breeze getting in and out for that amount of people. Plenty of large restrooms.  I don??t think I can say enough about that band??..Great experience."
5468,Date of experience: November 2013,9-Nov-13,Big Ten,ohio state,3,Signs?,"The University needs to put more signs up around the medical center.  As it is under more construction (what university/hospital ever is NOT?), you have to be careful especially with the parking.  Is there some kind of law against signs in Ohio?"

Laid out well for tailgating and with all kinds of things to see and do.

5470,Date of experience: October 2013,29-Oct-13,Big Ten,ohio state,4,Great first trip to the horseshoe,"Great game at the stadium, however, if you're in the nosebleed section like we were in the 'newer' section, be prepared to be dizzy. Heights do not bother me, but these seats made you feel sick. Everyone around us was complaining. Great game vs Penn State just bad seats."
5471,Date of experience: October 2013,28-Oct-13,Big Ten,ohio state,4,The Band is unbelievable........,"Went for the OSU - Penn State game. Our first college game experience. All staff are very friendly and receptive. Stadium handles 106,000 people with ease. Getting in/out was surprisingly fast. The band is worth the price of admission! Great experience for the family."
5473,Date of experience: October 2013,10-Oct-13,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Nothing better!,There is nothing better than the crowd atmosphere at an Ohio State football game.

My wife and I got tickets to the Wisconsin game and it was amazing!  Loud, intense, hard-core fans, The Best Damn Band In The Land, Urban's team was spectacular, and a thrilling experience.  My wife went to USC, and even admitted it was an amazing experience!  Go Bucks!!"
5476,Date of experience: September 2013,1-Oct-13,Big Ten,ohio state,4,Exciting Visit,"We recently visited for the UW vs OSU game.  Overall, a beautiful older stadium.  It was amazing seeing how many fans showed up (3rd most in stadium history)!  It seemed as if even with how huge the stadium is, all of the seats had a fairly good view.  They also had a great variety of food!  The only downfall is the lack of atmosphere/cheers.  After visiting numerous other Big Ten stadiums, I would say OSU had less fun cheers that every participated in.  Regardless, it was a blast and I would recommend it if you haven't visited it in the before!"

We go to at least one game every year and always the Michigan game when it is at home.  The stadium is old but well taken care of.  There have been several renovations over the years.  There is a giant screen that is visible from most of the stadium
5481,Date of experience: September 2013,8-Sep-13,Big Ten,ohio state,4,In town on a Saturday in the fall?You must go to the game,"Yes, I am an OSU fan who grew up in CA. The experience begins before kickoff. No where else will you see people of all ages running arround before kickoff to get to see the marching band. Watching them march and spell out Ohio in cursive (Script Ohio) is impressive. Football here is a religion and the stadium is where you must go. 1 star off for parking. We got there late, 2 hours before kickoff and had a nice hike to our seats on the c deck."
5482,Date of experience: August 2013,4-Sep-13,Big Ten,ohio state,2,Concession Service Sorely in need of Overhaul,Longest line I have ever experienced in the Shoe.  A trip to pick up a pre-game (nearly an hour early to kick off) stadium dog and bottled water ended up a frustrating and very time consuming experience. Language barrier as well as slow responding credit card authorization machines resulted in a 45 minute wait and missing the first band entrance of the new football season. Sorely lacking in customer service and quality food products this time around.

No other location can match this incomparable experience.  a beautiful facility in its own right, the recent expansion has preserved the look, feel, and character of the stadium.Ohio Stadium is, though, merely emblematic of the great university that surrounds it.

Well, Ohio Stadium is certainly a great start. This old, historic venue where men like Woody Hayes and Knute Rockne once roamed the lush sidelines is not to be missed. It's a tough ticket but worth it if you have to shell out a little bit of a premium. Of course, it would have been nice had Nebraska showed up on this wonderful October day!"
5508,Date of experience: January 2013,12-Feb-13,Big Ten,ohio state,1,dissapointing,had a look round it was ok but visited much bigger and better stadiums in New York and i think the crowd was not as passionate as they are in bigger cities but everybody was friendly.
5510,Date of experience: November 2012,8-Feb-13,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Always fantastic!,If you're in Columbus and it's a home football game -- be sure to TRY to get a ticket to the game there.  Beautiful historic stadium on The Ohio State University campus.
5511,Date of experience: September 2012,5-Feb-13,Big Ten,ohio state,4,Football game,"Took my wife to her first OSU football game this past fall. Was a pretty nice stadium. The seats were good and the atmosphere outside was just what you expect out of an OSU game. We ate breakfast at the Blackwell, which was good. Them made our way to the stadium. We sat in the A deck and had no problem viewing the game. Although I hear that some parts of the stadium watching the game is part of the game. There certainly are ""nose-bleeds"" and areas where obstructions are great than actually being able to view a game, but our seat were pretty nice."

5514,Date of experience: September 2012,2-Jan-13,Big Ten,ohio state,5,It's the 'Shoe. What else is there to say?,"The Bucks played their 12-0 undefeated season on these very grounds. The seats fill with scarlet-and-grey decked fans who are crazy about their team. The seating's not too bad, pretty comfortable, unless you're on the bleachers. Great views from everywhere in the Stadium. I've been on this field several times as well, and I've gotta say, it's a pretty magnificent feeling. If you're a Buckeye or an OSU fan, you should definitely visit at least once on game day!"

It's a great environment, especially in the football world.  Be prepared for the place to be packed and to be sitting/standing elbow to elbow with your neighbor, but it's always a good time.  I've sat in C deck to about 5 rows off the field, just be sure not to get seats behind the pillars.  Get there early to watch TBDBITL perform Script Ohio.  Go Bucks!"

I do believe it took about the whole first quarter till all of us had recovered enough to have a conversation that didnt leave us winded.

As an alumni, I went to many games at Ohio stadium. 100,000 plus fans cheering is a very awesome thing to behold. Parking is difficult on game days as all of Columbus gets clogged up. You can take a bus from different parking lots or walk. As for those who say the fans are bad, its very stadium specific. Having been to other Big Ten stadiums the fans are no better or worse. Overall a great thing to do at least once in your life if you live in Ohio or are a Buckeye fan."
5539,Date of experience: October 2012,11-Oct-12,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Amazing!,"We didn't watch a game there but were allowed in as visitors to explore the stadium.

5540,Date of experience: October 2012,11-Oct-12,Big Ten,ohio state,4,homecoming under the lights was a great experience,"although the outcome of the football game was not great, Ohio Stadium is a great place to watch a college football game.  Aside from some goofy OSU customs and traditions (they seem to be compelled to constantly spell out the name of their state at the top of their lungs, with accompanying arm motions, makes you wonder if they would struggle if they lived in a state with a name longer than 4 letters, the electronic scoreboard gong that makes the crowd stand up at every opponents 3rd down, their total reverence for ""script Ohio"" and dotting of the i, etc) it's generally a fun experience.  The fans seem to struggle with sportsmanship toward their opponents (frequently booing the college kids) but not as bad as some stadiums.  They aren't overly abusive to visiting fans and the OSU band is really good."
5541,Date of experience: October 2012,11-Oct-12,Big Ten,ohio state,5,THE best college football venue,"As an almuni I may be biased, but this is an amazing place to catch a college football game. Size alone is enough to have people standing in awe. 106,000 attended the game when we were there. Do be warned there are no backs on most seats (you have to pay for that) and bathrooms are the basics. Lots of monitors in concession area allow you to make sure you don't miss any action if you leave your seat."

We walked to the stadium from our hotel room so we did not have to worry about traffic or parking expenses.  There was some tailgating going on, which is to be expected for a college game.  We bought seat cushions from the student association on our way in to the stadium.We arrived a little early so there was no waiting in line to enter the stadium.  However, I don't think there would be a long wait at any point in time because there are many many many entrances.  The ticket people were quick and friendly and offered assistance to help us find our seats.The concessions were moderately priced, which was to be expected as food at sporting events are generally marked up.  The apparel shops were high priced, but that didn't stop my husband from buying a jersey.  I contemplated purchasing a hat because it was a very sunny day, but couldn't bring myself to spend $23 on a ballcap.The crowd is amazing.  Attendence the day we were there was 105,019.  The marching band, of course, was phenomonal, with Script Ohio as the finale!  Sadly, our seats were very close to the field so we didn't get to see it, it just looked like people marching on the field, but the megatron big screen displayed a great view.The bathrooms were pretty clean and there are a lot of them.  Believe it or not, I never had to wait in line for the ladies room.  They were generally clean, with lots of stalls.  We will definitely return for another game in the next season!Luckily we witness a win so that always makes the experience better."

The crowd and environment is electric, the Band (TBDBITL) is amazing and the football is tremendous.  If you haven't watched college football in Columbus, then you haven't lived!"
5552,Date of experience: September 2012,19-Sep-12,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Nice place to watch a winning team,"I have been to this stadium since I was 12 (40 years ago) as a Boy Scout ushering fans in the day when they lets kids to important stuff. The days of Archie, Cornelius Green and other greats who knew how to scramble and make the game entertaining. The ""house""as I call it has gotten better and cleaner. Now that it is closed in and updated it is an even better place to watch the Best Damn Band in the land enter the field and wait for the drum major to lead in grand fashion to the sound of the fight song followed by Carmen Ohio.Nice place to spend a saturday but then I might be a bit biased."
5553,Date of experience: September 2012,18-Sep-12,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Go Buckeyes,A great place to be on a Sept afternoon when the Buckeyes are at home.  One of the great college game day atmospheres.

Fun with freinds/relatiives. Seating very close (& small). Alot stairs. Parking not really that close & can be costly. Better to take the ""COTA"" bus & park remote. You will have to wait to get on the return bus but, you won't have to fight the traffic."
5567,Date of experience: September 2011,17-Jul-12,Big Ten,ohio state,5,One of America's Great Sports Places,"I've been to 9 of the 12 Football Stadiums in the Big Ten conference, and I have to say Ohio Stadium is the best. In terms of  architecture, history, sightlines and more, it's as incomparable as Script Ohio -- the greatest college marching band tradition.Yes, I now have a local bias.  But I grew up elsewhere and even attended a couple times as a visitor.  And contrary to another reviewer's comment, I had no problem whatsoever with the home fans. Admittedly if the opponent is the Michigan Wolverines, the level of poor sportsmanship exhibited by a portion of the crowd falls below minimum standards.  That's unfortunate, and it should change.  But for any other match-up, Ohio Stadium is simply a great place to watch football.Personally, my favorite vantage point is C Deck, in the lower rows.  Also, it's preferable to be in the Horseshoe as opposed to the South Stands, if for no other reason than to view the outstanding video screen and scoreboard.  But truthfully most locations have their selling points.  This is a football-only stadium with all of the fans right on top of the action.  About 10 years ago an extensive renovation included removal of the running track, bringing fans even closer to the game.  At the same, the field was lowered to improve the view from the lowest rows.One caveat: Most of the seating is bench style, as opposed to individual chairs.  I suppose that's inevitable, given the need to squeeze 105,000+ into the facility.  But if sitting on a metal bench for 3+ hours sounds iffy, just bring along a seat cushion and you'll be fine.  Also, souvenior seat cushions are for sale.  IIRC, the best place to find one is at a booth outside the rotunda (main entrance) at the North End of the stadium.Enjoy the stadium, and Go Bucks!"

5570,Date of experience: November 2011,5-Jul-12,Big Ten,ohio state,4,It's the Shoe...You Know How You Feel,"Most people already know how they feel about Buckeye Football - no stadium review is going to change their mind either way. That said, if you are visiting from some part of the world where you have not had the opportunity to experience big time college football, this is the place to do it. If you're looking for the experience rather than game quality, go for one of the early season games against a smaller opponent - there are usually ample and relatively inexpensive tickets available through online sellers and outside the stadium on game day. Make sure to arrive early to watch the teams warm up and the band come in, and make sure to stay at the end to hear the team sing to the band."

It's very nice."

The bathrooms need some work, seating is quite cramped on all levels and the football games are guaranteed to be sold out up until the point that the Buckeyes lose their second game of the season, which is when their fan base stops coming to the games.  Generally lots of inebriated football fans standing up in front of you and shouting you down if you have the guts to root for the other team...."

5584,Date of experience: October 2011,29-Mar-12,Big Ten,ohio state,5,Living history,"The names of most of the greatest football players to ever have put on a college uniform and played NCAA football have been on this field. Ohio State, Michigan, Northwestern, Penn State, and many other colleges and universities have played on this field. Several dozen Heisman Trophy winners have been on this grass. It has been updated and modernized several times, but the foundation is still the same. Much of what college football is today traces its roots back to this facility. It's hard to stand here and not hear the echo of the voices of many of the names that will forever being recognized as the best football players ever. Whether it is a game or just walking by and looking inside at the grass and the massive horseshoe, it's worth your time rubbing shoulders with the ghosts and memories of those people that have played or coached here."

If you're in town and there isn't a game, that's okay, you can still drive by and take in the sight.  If you're lucky enough to go to the game, do yourself a favor and make sure that you are IN YOUR SEATS 25 minutes before game time, no exceptions, and you can see the band come marching out of the tunnel.

Although when we are playing a top ranked opponent there may NOT be a single better place to be then in Ohio Stadium.  Ohio Stadium is awesome. Try to stay out of south stands and beware the obstructed views in higher B deck rows, also beyond 30 rows up in C deck is quite a hike.  Enjoy.  GO BUCKS!"

From massive tailgates around the stadium to great seats everywhere you go.    Such a fun time, UofO is the home of the filming of Animal house and they are very proud of this herititage.   The second half of all home games features a crowd raising rendition of ""Shout"" where everyone is ready to party or move by this time.  Cool places to go at halftime with games and bounces  for big and little kids and lots of drink choices at the far end of the stadium.    We went in a big group which made it extra fun.   But, this was not our first rodeo at Autzen, just first civil war game.   Hoping there will be many more years to visit the mighty ducks and their exciting team."
5642,Date of experience: October 2019,5-Nov-19,Big Ten,Oregon,1,Go Ducks!!!,The Ducks are great. But attending a game at Autzen is a real pain. $100.00 plus tickets and sitting with a bunch of drunk fans. Not any fun.

The stadium is nice and UO games are events. Our seats were very high up, near the press box but the view of the field was excellent. The only issue is getting out of the stadium after the game. Everyone in the upper rows have to go exit through only a few tunnels and it takes quite a while for the crowd to start moving. Once through the first tunnel onto the concourse, there are more log jams of people to get to the next set of stairs to get out."

I was attending school there, on exchange from Alaska, and I fell in love with being a Duck as soon as the game started and I participated in my first wave there.  I moved back in 2001, and got a piece of the old turf when they were upgrading the stadium.  The update only made me love that stadium and being a Duck more, and I've been back for many a game...it's an infectious place to be...unless you're with the opposing team...we get it louder than is capable in many collegiate stadiums throughout the country.Come visit sometime...make sure you wear some lightning yellow and thunder green...and get ready for one heck of a game!!!....GO DUCKS!!!"

I love the Ducks and Autzen Stadium is the very BEST!Visiting fans often tell us how much they enjoy coming to Autzen. The facility is great, the announcer, Don Essig, is clear and honestly the best football announcer I know of. I have gone to several away games, no one comes close to Don Essig.The spirit is absolutely electric. My only complaint is they sell alcohol in the stands now and we've had 3 bad experiences with drunk fans near us. The last two games there was not a problem. It can be an issue, though. They are over selling alcohol."
5667,Date of experience: December 2017,7-Nov-18,Big Ten,Oregon,4,"Autzen is great, Parking is awful!","As a student going to the UO, I know that I have to avoid Autzen or the area surrounding it during any event because of traffic. I love going to Autzen for certain events and honestly, the football game crowd is on a whole other level of fun. Even if you don't enjoy football, the atmosphere is great. A way to get around parking, you are better off finding a restaurant or a small business a few blocks down and check to see if they are willing to lend a parking spot for a price, a lot of them do and a lot of them don't. OR next best thing is to park at Valley River Center Mall and take a shuttle or bus ride to the stadium. The shuttle and bus may be packed, but it's better than sitting in your car waiting for a spot or waiting to get out. I'm going to be honest, Oregon drivers can be on the rude side. (sorry guys). Last time I tried to get out of my parking across from Autzen, my husband and I spent 2 hours in our spot because no one wanted to let us into the line. We almost get hit because people were stubborn."

The stadium itself is surrounded by trees and hills of Eugene, which provide a lovely backdrop especially at sunset or in the fall when everything turns orange, yellow or red.   There is lots to do as fans gather in the huge indoor facility lined with tables and chairs which provides food, drinks, TV screens, games and souvenirs for sale.  There are several shuttle stations where visitors can leave their cars and catch the bus for a short ride to Autzen, missing the hassle and bustle of trying to find a parking space in the packed stadium lots.  Of course, there are also fans who enjoy tailgating so there is always activity happening way before the game starts.  There's lots of fun to be had at the stadium and they say it never rains on Autzen."
5674,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Oct-18,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Football,You cant beat the Autzen experience especially when the Ducks are winningThe atmosphere is wild and it never rains at Autzen
5675,Date of experience: September 2018,27-Sep-18,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Excellent stadium,"I attended a game here, and although I was rooting against Oregon, I came away impressed.  The stadium is not that large, but it was the loudest one I have ever been to.  Although the fans are intense, they were also friendly, even to the rival team's fans.  Oddly, the stadium doesn't open for seating until just 90 minutes before kickoff, but there is a huge indoor ""football experience"" area with activities, food and ample seating and TVs showing other games.The transportation to and from the stadium is terrific.  You can get a bus from downtown Eugene for just $5.  After the game, they have a bunch of lines set up for different buses going different places.  It's very well-organized.  The first bus back to Eugene filled up, but another one came a few minutes later and it took me no time at all to get back after the game.  That's not a typical gameday experience."
5676,Date of experience: September 2018,18-Sep-18,Big Ten,Oregon,4,"A lot of variety, fairly priced for a sports venue","We went to see a Ducks game and enjoyed reasonably priced seat (< $50 each) at about the 10 yard line, about 45 row off the field. The view of the field was great and the seats were comfortable. Bathrooms were accessible as were concessions. The food options were reasonable (not necessarily the most healthy of all possible choices) and good. They also were priced fairly considering that it is a sports venue - the prices at the Rose Garden in Portland often were double or more for the same item/same size/quality."
5677,Date of experience: September 2018,11-Sep-18,Big Ten,Oregon,4,Great family afternoon!,When coming to Eugene leave time to catch a football game! You won??t be disappointed by the talent on the field! ??Go Ducks!??
5678,Date of experience: September 2018,3-Sep-18,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Go Ducks!,What a great place. Ducks fans are crazy fun. Not a bad seat in the stadium. We have sat in a number of different sections and enjoyed the game every time.
5679,Date of experience: October 2017,27-Aug-18,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Great Venue!!!,"If you're a football fan- (especially a Duck Fan) you'll love this place. Lots of food carts, beer and wine-- Dutch Bros. The line for coffee tends to be longer, so hopefully this year it will move quicker. Located on the east side of Eugene near the Willamette, if you get to the game early and want to take a walk to stretch your legs- before tailgaiting- the scenery is beautiful!"
5680,Date of experience: December 2017,26-Aug-18,Big Ten,Oregon,5,can't wait for the season to start!,just one more week until we begin to find out what this year's Ducks can do - the beer flow in the stands might improve the noise level during the second half of games
5681,Date of experience: November 2017,20-Aug-18,Big Ten,Oregon,4,Ducks? Tailgating? Good Times:,"Really a great stadium. Plenty of parking, good eats and beer. People mostly hospitable. Few security hassles. And of course the Ducks...one of the best college football teams in the universe!"
5682,Date of experience: November 2017,6-Aug-18,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Great venue for college football games!,"If you??re a football fan this a great place to spend a Saturday watching the Ducks play. The Moshofsky is a huge indoor practice facility used for tailgating before and at halftime of games. Plenty to do and eat with live music, cheerleaders, tv??s for other games, and fun things for kids to while waiting for the start of the game. Get there early as it??s a popular place and fills up quick. There??s not a bad seat in the place and it??s a loud place once the game starts. With that all said I prefer the southern end so you can watch the large screen for replays. Lots of food in the stadium and hopefully a Duck win."
5683,Date of experience: September 2017,6-Aug-18,Big Ten,Oregon,5,football magic,"if you like football, and the mighty Oregon ducks, you are in for a treat! My husband and I shared 20 season years with the teams and coaches, some of the most down to earth people in the world. Enjoy pregame tailgating in the Moshofsky center, then walk or tram up the incline to you seats, not a bad one in the house. The fans are very savy, and know their football lingo and calls by officials, and if lucky to have a night game ticket, it is an electric experience!"
5684,Date of experience: December 2017,6-Aug-18,Big Ten,Oregon,5,OSU football game at Autzen Statium,We went to the ducks/beavers game with our grandson and had a great time rooting for both teams as our grandson lives in Corvallis and likes the beavers also. Final ducks win big and we all had a excellent time. What a great birthday it was.

5686,Date of experience: October 2017,9-Jul-18,Big Ten,Oregon,4,Home of the Ducks!,"It never ceases to amaze us at the amount of people that attened these games. The Duck's Football Team are so popular that fans come from all over Oregon to watch exciting football. There are 65,000 seats. The roar of the crowd can be overwheling at times so some folks might want to wear ear protection."
5687,Date of experience: January 2018,9-Jul-18,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Willamette Valley Football Championship,Such a great environment for the kids. The field was perfect and being able to watch the games on the big screen was very cool.
5693,Date of experience: December 2017,21-Dec-17,Big Ten,Oregon,5,"Great venue on game day, Go Ducks!",Autzen is the center of Duck Football madness in Eugene. Definitely a must do if you are around for a home game. The stadium is well set up for a great view no matter where you are perched. Even if you don't know locals for tailgating with you can go to Moshofsky Center for food and drink before the game and at halftime. Come join some of the best fans in the PAC conference.
5694,Date of experience: December 2017,15-Dec-17,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Just an amazing experience - One of my favourite stadiums,I'd always wanted to visit the home of the mighty Oregon Ducks - Autzen Stadium and I was fortunate to do this. What an amazing experience - From the run on the stadium to the Marcus Marriota Centre of Excellence to the Duck Store..... I love it all - Check out the pics
5695,Date of experience: November 2017,29-Nov-17,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Impressive stadium!,"Beautiful stadium, however they ought to let taxis up to the front gates.  Since parking is so hard to find, we walked more than a mile to get to the stadium, but found that we couldn't get a taxi to the front gates."
5696,Date of experience: November 2017,28-Nov-17,Big Ten,Oregon,4,Civil War,"What is more fun than college football games?  And what is more exciting than the regional match-ups?  I've only been to the Oregon - Oregon State games.  I've stood up for the entire game in the end zone with rabid fans (even though we had places to sit).  The stadium is comfortable.  I even fell over backwards coming down the stairs when my foot got stuck on the frost (no, did not slip, foot refused to let go).  Many gentlemen jumped to my rescue - I was just embarrassed."
5697,Date of experience: January 2017,2-Nov-17,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Bestest loudest craziest football stadium,"There's several reasons visiting football teams hate Autzen. One, it's LOUD! Two, it's really LOUD!    It's also a terrific venue for football though ,,,,, go there! And GO DUCKS!"
5698,Date of experience: October 2017,30-Oct-17,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Football game,"Great experience watching a duck football game, great fans, food pregame excellent overall great experience  glad to experience the stadium on trip to see all pac 12 stadiums"
5699,Date of experience: October 2017,20-Oct-17,Big Ten,Oregon,5,College football outdoors,Took the walk with all the other fans. Getting into the stadium is easy as it is well marked. Alcohol is not allowed in the stadium but you will find everyone right next door partaking. We got seats off of StubHub. They were pretty good! I loved the backdrop with the mountains... so pretty.
5700,Date of experience: October 2017,11-Oct-17,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Great Stadium for College Football,"We were on an Oregon roadtrip and decided to watch a college football game in Eugene.  The venue is really cool and HUGE (seating capacity 55,000 people).  There are many food options for purchase AND the biggest plus is that you can bring in your own snacks/sealed water.  The stadium doesn't open until 90minutes prior to kickoff, but it didn't seem too crowded and we didn't run into any lines anywhere.  We parked at Albertsons and walked the 1.5miles, which was the perfect choice.  We avoided all traffic, were close to I-5, and it was free.  There were a lot of tailgating opportunities if you're a Duck fan.  We're not, but the fans were, for the most part, very friendly and mild.  There aren't many chairs undercover nor are there seatbacks (we brought our own stadium chairs, which worked fine).  They also have stadium chairs available to rent ($8 each) if you prefer.  The stadium is completely open and if it rains, you'll need a poncho.  We had a great time there with our three boys (aged 6, 7, and 9) and inlaws.  GO COUGS!"
5701,Date of experience: September 2017,8-Oct-17,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Great stadium to watch a game,"Was in Eugene for a meeting and went to Autzen for the game.  It was built in 1967 but has all the modern items a stadium needs.  There are big screens above both endzones so you can replays of the action if you miss it on the field.  The Duck fans are LOUD and the students are big supporters of their team with the Duck mascot doing push ups for every point scored by the home team, which can be a lot.  The uniforms are always colorful to say the least and the play on the field is fast with few breaks except for the TV timeouts.  Before the kickoff there are lots of tailgate parties, most by local fans, but some are sponsored as well.  Since the Ducks won it was a great way to spend a Saturday at the stadium."
5702,Date of experience: September 2017,3-Oct-17,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Best stadium ever,There is no place more fun to watch football! The Ducks are always exciting and ususally win. Great fans and food. Lot's of room for tailgating outside.
5703,Date of experience: September 2017,10-Sep-17,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Ducks vs Huskers foolball game,"Having met one of the locals here in Eugene, we were invited to a tailgating lunch before to big game. We bought some tickets to the big game and had an awesome time! Never experienced an atmosphere like that. Even if you are not into sport in a big way, you will enjoy all the entertainment during the frequent stops in the game. Well worth an afternoon in the sun!"
5704,Date of experience: September 2017,9-Sep-17,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Great experience,We were disappointed with the outcome of the Nebraska Oregon game but the stadium and fans were outstanding. I love college football and Autzen Stadium is a jewel.
5705,Date of experience: October 2016,6-Sep-17,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Best stadium ever,Best place to watch the ducks play! Will always come back to see games here. Can't wait for the weekend.
5706,Date of experience: September 2017,3-Sep-17,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Beautiful stadium but not very hospitable to our team!,"The facilities were fabulous.  We enjoyed the stadium and thought most of the people were friendly and kind.  As in all places, there were a few that we could have been a little less intoxicated.   But that's the way it is."
5707,Date of experience: September 2016,5-Aug-17,Big Ten,Oregon,4,A must,Fallen a notch from past glory but on it's way back to where it should for loyal sports fans.  A first class facility.
5709,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Jul-17,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Go Ducks!,"I watched many a football game during my years at UO. More losing games than winners then, but they've more than made up for it since."

Sure, there's the rivalry aspect but we are glad to have you come to our town anytime.  We will see if this changes now that our winning season streak has ended but we're looking forward to starting a new one this football season!  Not a bad seat in the house!"
5712,Date of experience: November 2016,10-Jul-17,Big Ten,Oregon,5,We love Autzen Stadium!,"My husband and I go to Ducks games as often as possible.  The stadium is wonderful, as are the fans. It's hard not to have a good time here!  Plus, we all know, it never rains at Autzen Stadium!"

5719,Date of experience: November 2016,13-Mar-17,Big Ten,Oregon,5,The Loudest Stadium Around,"Be prepared for noise when you attend a football game here. Most seats provide good views and best of all ""it never rains in Autzen Stadium""."
5720,Date of experience: September 2016,14-Feb-17,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Great place to watch college football,I have been a season ticket holder for 15 years and my family and I look forward to watching the Ducks every fall. Transportation to the game is easy as they provide ten park and ride locations around Eugene and Springfield. Buses drop you off in front of the stadium and it's a short walk across the street to the entrance gates. Shuttle service is provided for those who need assistance in getting up steps. Numerous food venues are available for your eating pleasure in and around the stadium. Getting out of the stadium is easy and takes little time. Buses wait for riders just beyond the exits and a short ride back to your car is a breeze.
5721,Date of experience: September 2016,14-Feb-17,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Attendance at several games,Autzen Stadium is a great place to tailgate.  The game time atmosphere is electric.  Be sure to ride the bus to the game as parking can be difficult.
5722,Date of experience: September 2016,17-Jan-17,Big Ten,Oregon,5,A Saturday Gameday Experience of the Highest Level!,"My wife and I have attended dozens of University of Oregon football games at Autzen Stadium over the past 20 years. The facilities are excellent, and the gameday atmosphere is electrifying. The fans are knowledgeable and friendly. Consider tailgating where you park. Thousands of others are doing that too. The traffic before and after gametime can be a bit intimidating, so some fans just stay on and continue their tailgaters after the game until traffic thins out."
5723,Date of experience: September 2016,17-Jan-17,Big Ten,Oregon,4,Football game,Great place to get together with friends and watch games. Lots of food and drink to choose from. We'll kept
5724,Date of experience: January 2016,30-Dec-16,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Awesome place to celebrate Football,"Over the last 10 years, I have gone to Autzen 6-7 times.  I like it every time more and more.  The stadium is gigantic.  The people are true fan since Eugene revolves around the UofO school and mostly around their football program.  The food at the place is actually pretty good but it will cost you a lot as most professional facilities.  My favorite part is the side stadium when you can go to when the weather worsen or when you want a break from the guy sitting on your right and complaining about every call.  This side stadium is covered and house a band and serve draft beer!  Go there."
5725,Date of experience: November 2016,20-Dec-16,Big Ten,Oregon,5,not a bad seat in the house,"I was surprised at how small the stadium is but found out there's <20K students at the university so there's no need for a huge stadium.  There's not a bad seat in the place since it's on the smaller side.  There are plenty of concessions which is nice and you can also head into the Mo Center to get some beer before the game and at halftime which is very cool.  It's a good place to catch a game, just home they start playing better to increase attendance"
5726,Date of experience: November 2016,27-Nov-16,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Always a good time,"I've been to 2 Ducks football games here and it has been great. Both times we've driven over 15 hours one way to see the game, and despite us losing both times it has still been awesome. Unmatched atmosphere. Everything is well organized and there are really great activities going before the game."
5727,Date of experience: October 2016,25-Nov-16,Big Ten,Oregon,4,Great place to watch a game!,Possibly the best atmosphere in the nation to watch a game!! Gorgeous views and the crowd is amazing but the facilities are showing their age. I can't believe that Phil Knight hasn't offered to make HUGE renovations??
5728,Date of experience: November 2016,17-Nov-16,Big Ten,Oregon,4,Even The Bad Seats Are Good!,"I've been going to football games at Autzen Stadium since it opened in 1967.I've sat in row 72 in the corner of the end zone and I've sat in he lower rows at the 40 yard line. All the seats are good.Concessions are high quality. They are over-priced like all sports facilities. Don Essig is a great home field announcer. The only one that Autzen has had!Ticket prices are getting ridiculously high. But, they aren't any higher than most college stadiums. I remember getting season tickets in 1969 for $32. The Stanford game I went to this year was $108 for one game!The atmosphere at Autzen is exciting, even when they're losing. And, it's insane when they're winning! Shout!"
5729,Date of experience: October 2016,10-Oct-16,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Always a great atmosphere for a game!,"Autzen stadium is one of the greatest environments and atmosphere around for a collegiate football game.

We were hoping to see the Casanova  58' Rose bowl ring that travelled on the space shuttle to the international space station and back to earth but the desk attendants did not know anything about it and we were never able to see it. If it is in the ""ring room"" we missed it."
5734,Date of experience: September 2016,20-Sep-16,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Duck game,Always awesome. Win or lose.  It's the perfect place for adult families to see each other each fall.  Been doing it now for 11 years fans for 32 years

Football fans are a bit churlish and over the top when compared to some of the other Pac-12 stadiums I have visited especially considering the Duck's tendency to fold under pressure.  1,000,000 football uniform combinations and ZERO national titles - that what Phil Knight's money will get you!"
5743,Date of experience: September 2016,8-Sep-16,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Go Ducks!,Autzen Stadium is on the other side of UO.

With ""Uncle"" Phil Knight as a contributor (Nike CEO), money is no object to outfitting this facility with all the coolest gadgets, video boards, and amenities to lure top high school talent to the University of Oregon."
5746,Date of experience: November 2015,27-Aug-16,Big Ten,Oregon,4,Nice stadium and loud crowds,Was there for UO football game. It is one of the loudest stadiums in the country. Be careful as some of the fans still think they are in college and have had too much to drink again. Always love it when the ducks win! Food vendors are okay in the stadium but they need an upgrade.

It is one of my favoite places. The layout is easy to understand. There are so many fun things in it's design. You can get so many fun pictures. There is a feeling so safety because of the large crown management staff, EPD, University Police, Parametics and Firemen ready. We seriously have the best announcer EVER! There isn't a bad view in the house.Our fans are the best. You always feel at home and like you're with family. The food is a bit over prices but what do you expect at a stadium? I'm learning by living in California that it is much more here! Plus local businesses get to fund raise. I love the gold O at one of the entrances. I love that the stadium literally seems like a multi medium piece of artwork! Plus green is my favorite color.Parking isn't bad. Walking over the foot bridge is even better.And I think the bus system is phenomnial. The best part? It never rains at Autzen Stadium!"

5765,Date of experience: September 2015,5-Apr-16,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Exceptional sports venue,"Autzen Stadium is the home of the Oregon Ducks and is an awesome place to watch a live College football game.  At only a 60,000 capacity, including SRO, it is said that this is one of the loudest college stadiums  in the country.  The graphics on the Jumbotron are great and the PA system lets everyone hear what the announcer says, whith no effort at all."
5766,Date of experience: September 2015,29-Mar-16,Big Ten,Oregon,4,It Never Rains in Autzen Stadium,"One of the best places on Earth for a college student, maybe not so much for a family atmosphere.  Some of my favorite memories are in this stadium, the energy, green and yellow, the love amongst ducks fans.  Yes there's always a few idiots but if we can keep it classy and civil, welcome our guests, and enjoy the experience, then it truly never rains in Autzen stadium."
5768,Date of experience: October 2015,23-Mar-16,Big Ten,Oregon,2,Not my favorite stadium....,"I REALLY don't like this place.  It's absolutely terrifying to navigate with thousands of people.  Not only do you have to ascend several sets of stairs that can be likened to Machu Picchu, but then you have to descend into a massive cavern where the play field is.  It's dangerous.  Did I mention that the track that surrounds the top of the stadium is not even flat?  It rolls with several hills.  Seriously?  I went to a football game with my Dad and it just sucked.  The seats, all be it cheap, were so narrow that my knees were in the back of the person in front of me.  I also had a set of knees in my back.  Just a bummer.  The end of the game was hell on earth.  Descending those stairs with thousands of fans was more frightening than climbing on Mount Rainier(Yes, I have done this).  I must mention that I am comparing this to more than a few college stadiums, so I feel comfortable being critical."
5769,Date of experience: November 2015,22-Mar-16,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Great Atmosphere - Home of the Ducks,Fun atmosphere for football.  Have had tickets for years and enjoyed every game.  There are no bad seats in the stadium and when the crowd gets going it's one of the loudest stadiums in the country.
5770,Date of experience: November 2015,15-Mar-16,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Oregon Ducks Home,My husband has been a season ticket holder for years and I have for 4. There is no place better to watch a football game than Autzen. The atmosphere is electric and the Duck fans rock the stadium for their cheering. I have never had so much fun than at the Duck's games. You have to try it one time and I bet  you will be hooked. GO DUCKS!!!!!
5771,Date of experience: November 2015,10-Feb-16,Big Ten,Oregon,4,Great place for a football game!,"I've been going to Autzen ever since it was built in 1968.  It IS one of the iconic places to watch college football and beats all the other college and pro stadiums I've been to because of the loudness and feeling it offers fans.Why 4 stars?  Because they have shut off access to the players.  I know you want to keep them safe, but losing that connection that we used to get is a disappointment."
5773,Date of experience: October 2015,8-Feb-16,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Football paradise,My husband and I have season tickets and this place is the best place for a football game.  The atmosphere is crazy!  We love it!!!!  If you've never been to a football game at Autzen I highly recommend you doing so.

5776,Date of experience: August 2015,22-Jan-16,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Go Ducks!,The atmosphere is incredible during games. Autzen is a notoriously loud and raucous place for football. Great adrenaline rush - especially when the home team wins.
5777,Date of experience: January 2016,20-Jan-16,Big Ten,Oregon,5,The best college football venue in the west.,"I've been to every Pac-12 stadium, LSU, Georgia, Michigan, Tennessee and Ohio State.  Autzen provides a fan experience second to none.  Every seat is decent or better owing to the proximity of the stands to the field.  The crowd is knowledgeable and varies from pretty loud to ear-shattering depending on the opponent and score.  Food options are greater than at most other colleges; prices are ""stadium high.""  The video replay screen is among the largest and clearest in the nation. There is a public, indoor tailgater at the adjoining practice facility.  Visiting teams' fans are generally treated well, although some UO students, like their counterparts elsewhere, can be obnoxious.  The UO cheerleaders are worth a visit whether there is a game or not."
5778,Date of experience: November 2015,21-Dec-15,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Great Atmosphere,"Fantastic facilities, great accessibility and an excellent home team atmospheres! Hotel access is well within driving distance as are restaurants and pubs."
5779,Date of experience: September 2015,17-Dec-15,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Great fans,Attended the Ducks vs Tennessee game in 2013. Oregon fans were incredible in their friendliness and passion they display for their team. The pre-game tailgate set up in the indoor facility was great as well.
5780,Date of experience: November 2015,16-Dec-15,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Just About Perfect,"Catching a game at Autzen on a nice day is by far the best fall outing in Eugene. Great high-energy fans, and the crowd logistics are handled really well. Best idea to avoid traffic is to park off-site at one of the many parking hubs and take the bus, a short quick ride that drops you near the front gate. Rent a seat cushion with back support as you enter. Ticket scalpers usually have good prices and availability for day of game, or look on e-bay or Craig's List. A little spend, but well worth it!"

5782,Date of experience: November 2015,16-Dec-15,Big Ten,Oregon,5,AWESOME AUTZEN!,"Easy to park and walk, great trail along and over the Willamette River, and beautiful stadium. Even better once you are inside.  The football energy is palpable, the fans are attentive, knowledgeable and ready to be LOUD! Seriously, if noise bothers you, or you want to take kids bring ear plugs!  Good food variety. No beer for sale inside the stadium, but you can buy beers next door at the Moshofsky Center next door."

Bitterly cold...one below zero the crowd was animated and the atmosphere real friendly. Nice walk to the huge stadium from the university beside the Willamette River."
5785,Date of experience: November 2015,11-Dec-15,Big Ten,Oregon,5,OUTRAGEOUS ATMOSPHERE FOR FOOTBALL,"Views are great from any seat.  Remodel from a couple years ago makes access easy from the south. When will the north be remodeled?  Game time is electric, a must see for a football fan. Enjoy tailgating with DUCKS. GO DUCKS!"
5786,Date of experience: November 2015,10-Dec-15,Big Ten,Oregon,4,Great Time and Go Ducks!,"Autzen Stadium is a wonderful place to see a college football game. The only knock is trying to find parking and stadium traffic. The Stadium is in a beautiful area near the river but there are limited roadways to get in and out. Plan appropriately but the best thing to do is to park your and take the bus in or walk to the stadium. The stadium can get very loud and is known as being one of the louder collegiate stadiums in the country which is amazing since it is not overly large. The one knock on the fans is the amount of drinking which goes on pre, half time and during. The college allows re-entry and fans go out to their cars to tank up since alcohol is not allowed inside. There is not a bad seat in the house and the stadium food is pretty decent.. Go Ducks!!!!"
5787,Date of experience: November 2015,5-Dec-15,Big Ten,Oregon,4,Civil war!,Nice stadium but not as big as other college football stadiums. They have a great fan zone. Going to a civil war game was totally worth it. Fans are awesome! You can walk down on the field after the game.
5788,Date of experience: November 2015,26-Nov-15,Big Ten,Oregon,5,GO Ducks!!,"If you havent been to an Oregon Ducks game then you need to. Whether youre an alumni, tourist or local, these games are super pumped up and supported by the local and college community alike. Everything is yellow and green and ""it never rains at Autzen!"" (not true) Some of my best memories including attending games at this magical place. From the pre-game super-tailgating parties to the post-game celebrations, this place is sure to entertain!"
5789,Date of experience: November 2015,17-Nov-15,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Go Ducks,"Thought we were in the ""nose bleed"" section but had an awesome view of the game! We could see the game at both ends clearly."

5792,Date of experience: October 2015,27-Oct-15,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Loudest college stadium in the country!,Going to a Ducks game at Autzen is an experience one should not miss. The fans are so loud when the team is on defense and very quiet when we are on offense. Be the twelth man on the field.
5793,Date of experience: September 2015,26-Oct-15,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Great Place for College Football!,"The stadium is loud, the fans are generally nice to visitors, and there is actually a great selection of game day food.  Oh, and the team has been great for going on over a decade now.  It often ranks in the top ten for college stadiums in the US, and I wouldn't disagree (and I've been to quite a few over the years).  Helps if you're a Duck fan.  Go Ducks!"
5794,Date of experience: October 2015,12-Oct-15,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Great stadium,"Great views from everywhere...terrific crowd enthusiasm...good local shuttle transportation to and from the games, well-marked and orderly!"
5795,Date of experience: October 2015,12-Oct-15,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Great college football venue,A great college football venue with a dramatic location and views of the Willamette Valley.  Duck football is always entertaining and the fans are fun and full of energy.  The walk from the main campus to the stadium across the Willamette River is worth the ticket price.
5796,Date of experience: September 2015,1-Oct-15,Big Ten,Oregon,4,Duck do better next time,good Stadium went to game for Utah and show Ducks get killed.  Lot of Duck Fan at the Game. It was fun.

5799,Date of experience: September 2015,27-Sep-15,Big Ten,Oregon,5,"Great seats, good sightlines for Ducks football","Visiting Portland and made a last minute to attend the game.  Scored good seats from a scalper with an acceptable mark-up on the 30 yard line.  It is a very festive experience with food and beverage available next to the stadium.  With capacity in the 50 thousand + range, Autzen is an excellent venue for college football."

Kid friendly. No bad seats! It gets very loud so keep that in mind with young kids.  We have actually brought all 3 of our kids as babies, if we sit in the main crowd we use ear muffs.But it's absolutely worth attending the game!"

5802,Date of experience: September 2015,16-Sep-15,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Autzen is the PLACE to watch football,Went to the Oregon/Eastern Washington game. Loved the atmosphere and the fans. This place is one of the loudest places I have ever been.
5803,Date of experience: September 2015,15-Sep-15,Big Ten,Oregon,4,High School Football at Autzen,"The stadium was huge as expected.  It was 100 plus while we were there for a special High School CA/ OR football event.  The boys and our faithful fans really enjoyed the adventure and opportunity to play in a large venue.  It was stinking hot though.  Usually two ten gallon cans of hydration are sufficient for pre-game and game.  We used at least double that and I ran out of ice refilling the cans.  It was so hot, I saw some of the boys wetting their shoes down. (first time for everything!) In spite of the heat, We had a good game against a very good Cottage Grove team from just down the freeway.  Being right on the Coast ourselves, I worried that the heat would overtake us by the fourth quarter but the boys acclimated well and we finally pulled away in the fourth . This made for some very happy photographs of the team and individuals with this great stadium as a backdrop.  Memories and good times."
5804,Date of experience: September 2015,9-Sep-15,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Great place for a game!,"This is one bowl of a stadium. The seats are arranged in way that there cannot be a bad one. Concessions and bath rooms are easily accessible,"
5805,Date of experience: September 2015,8-Sep-15,Big Ten,Oregon,5,College football at its best,"If you love college football it's a must experience. The fans are always engaged, LOUD and fun. The stadium and surrounding facilities are state of the art (thanks to Phil Knight, Nike). Eugene is a small town feel, with great spirit and Love their Ducks. The Willamette river can be seen from stadium, their are many fun eateries and micro brew pubs close by in downtown.  You can also park at the University and walk over the river and experience the crowd fun.  It's why College Game Day comes year after year!  Stop by to see the Heisman trophy display"

Autzen is unreal. The noise, the love for the Ducks, the pregame fun in the Mo', it's all a good time.Concessions are spendy as can be, but have you ever had a cheap concession stand before? GOOOOOOOOOOOO DUCKS!!!!!!!!!"
5813,Date of experience: November 2014,13-Aug-15,Big Ten,Oregon,4,Enthusiastic Crowds and Good Times,"Autzen is the traditional monument to the modern day gladiator games - football. It's a pro-ball stadium in disguise as a college-ball genre.  It's well laid out with plenty of access and finding the seating is easy. Really, I don't think there's a bad seat in the house.  People flock to it like migrating lemmings with excitement and camaraderie.  It's just as fun to watch the people as it is to watch the game.Organizers have mastered the busing system to move the masses to and from the stadium from Valley River Center, Lane County Fairgrounds and more- which makes it soooo easy to leave the driving to someone else.  The only complaint I really have is about the women's bathrooms.  The designers were all men who don't have to stand around waiting for their spouse to come out of the bathroom because women need seated situations.  (they got it right with the new PK Park Baseball - stadium).It's definitely something to see and experience.  I attend at least 2 - 3 games every season just for fun."
5814,Date of experience: November 2014,10-Aug-15,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Best Stadium in the PAC 12,"Just a great venue for viewing football. Some times it gets very loud, but that's not a bad thing. Don't miss the walk across the river and see Autzen come into view on game day."

The stadium is well laid out and with the newly remodeled entrance ramps, access is not only easier it is really fun and informative.  They have remodeled the entire north entrance areas and have included two waterfalls and planted hundreds of native Oregon trees, shrubs and ferns to help visitors start to get a feel for our lovely state.  They have also installed some beautiful natural wood benches made all from locally and sustainably harvested trees!"
5821,Date of experience: October 2014,3-Apr-15,Big Ten,Oregon,5,"Amazing quality, all around.","Aptly named 'the loudest stadium'--if you're attending a football game, be prepared to need ear plugs (or breaks from the action spots) to give your ears a rest. It was expertly planned and built and offers some of the best, most exciting entertainment in Eugene, OR."
5823,Date of experience: November 2014,16-Mar-15,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Land of the Ducks,Be prepared for the loudest venue in NCAA football. The stadium screams teamwork and fandom. Best place to watch the Ducks win the day. Can't wait for football season to start again.

5826,Date of experience: November 2014,3-Jan-15,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Magical and ear-damaging,"Truly a magic place.  Not a bad seat.  The field is lower than the seating, so the view of the game is excellent from all seats, even the first few rows which are often terrible in other stadiums.  Autzen is one of the loudest and highest energy college stadium in the nation.  It is a great experience.  Access to facilities is a bit limited and porta-potties are brought in and placed inside the stadium gates.  Good food choices and if it is cold or raining, you can warm up in The Mo Center.  A really fun day.  Parking is a pain and expensive.  Get there early.It never rains at Autzen.  There is no place like home...and Autzen is home."
5827,Date of experience: October 2014,31-Dec-14,Big Ten,Oregon,5,"Love, Love, Love Autzen and UofO","Great atmosphere with very friendly fans.  Get to the game early and check out the team's practice facility where on game days, it's transformed into an pre-game area for fans.  They have live entertainment, food, stuff for the kids.  If you are crossing the Willamette, be prepared for a LOOOONG wait to get back after the game.  You will end up waiting about 45 mins. with thousands of irritating college students trying to cross the bridge in small groups."
5828,Date of experience: November 2014,5-Dec-14,Big Ten,Oregon,5,Awesome Experience,Even if you are not a fan of the Ducks everyone should experience a game at this stadium.

Duck football is so much fun and I can't imagine a better place than Autzen. Thanks to Uncle Phil Knight, Autzen is state of the art.  We are known for being the loudest stadium in the country.

Amazing views, state-of-the-art facilities. I loved how LOUD the stadium was and I loved watching our team respond to the noise. Great stadium announcer ... very classy (""Please do not boo when opposing team players are injured""). The fans are great and I had a fabulous time talking to them even though they hated our team (in a fun way ... after all we beat them 2 years in a row prior to this game :) :) ).I highly recommend a trip to watch a game here ... I can't wait to go back .. oh did I forget to say ""it never rains in Autzen Stadium"" :) :) :)"
5833,Date of experience: November 2019,21-Jan-20,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Amazing place!,"I have been here multiple times for penn state football games. It is a very large facility. The seats are metal bleachers, unless you buy stadium cushions and backs. The bathrooms are not the best... they are very cold when it is cold outside and not very large. I think anywhere you sit is a great seat! The scoreboards are large and easy to see replays and such on. Parking is another whole review... unless you pay a lot of money, you??re going to have to walk pretty far. Shuttles and Uber is the way to go. Hope to be back many more times!!"

5838,Date of experience: September 2019,14-Oct-19,Big Ten,Penn state,4,Love Penn State Ball but the Seat Size?,"I know 18"" seats are the new normal but this seat size is ridiculous.  I am not overweight but all it takes is one in the aisle and it doesn't work anymore.  Even not being overweight, I don't know if I technically fit.The Blue Band makes for an amazing experience.  Food prices are great for a stadium.  Parking is rough and the bathroom situation is not always great on game day."
5839,Date of experience: October 2019,14-Oct-19,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Best stadium in the country,"Beaver Stadium is electrifying. The student section is the best and loudest in the country. The seating is big enough to sit comfortably even with a coat on. The bowl is arranged so you have clear views from every seat. The food stands a plentiful and have varied selections. The parking is very good with an easy walk to the stadium. Penn State fans treat visiting guest with respect and are welcoming.If you have a chance to visit this stadium, do it you won't be sorry. Make sure you buy a ticket in advance or pay the scalpers price."
5840,Date of experience: October 2019,6-Oct-19,Big Ten,Penn state,4,First Game at Beaver Stadium,"Our friends took us to a game at Beaver Stadium and got us club seat tickets.  Great venue to see a game.  Our tickets came with a parking pass, but the cost of parking is a bit excessive, and the distance from the lots to the stadium vary, so be prepared to walk.  Just seeing all the tailgate setups is impressive.  Fans really put a lot into their tailgating.  The atmosphere in the stadium is second to none.  So much going on throughout the entire game.  I have to admit, the club seats made the game more fun to watch.  The seats have backs and cup holders.  The club itself has seats, and the it??s climate controlled.  There are all kinds of food for purchase, as well as drinks, including beer.  Plus, there are bathrooms, which are easy to access.  Certainly worth the splurge.  We had a great time, the weather was perfect, plus PSU won.  Doesn??t get any better than that."
5841,Date of experience: September 2019,1-Oct-19,Big Ten,Penn state,4,Fun time,It??s a great place to see a game at if you don??t mind the TSA type of screening to get in plus try to avoid the drunks.

My biggest beef was that my wife couldn??t take her small purse inside even though security searched it physically and with a wand.  I am all for safety, but the female guard was short and rude with my wife.  After my wife complied, the guard still was making an issue...maybe it??s time to find other work.The section/seat labels are not clear enough.  With the addition of seats over the years, it seems the signs haven??t kept up and many of the ushers, while polite, aren??t much help.Again, a fun experience could be made even better with some tweaking.  Definitely worth seeing a football game here."

When all the seats are filled (which is not uncommon), more than 107,000 fans are in the house. The place is utterly electric, especially during ??White Out?? night games when Lion fans answer each other with the now iconic, ??We Are....Penn State?? cheer. If I am not in the stands & instead sitting on my deck 2 miles, as the crow flies, from Beaver Stadium, I can clearly hear the shared chant. Beaver Stadium is a special place, one that is forever a part of the experience of being a Nittany Lion. There is an urban legend that proclaims that if anyone shouts, ??We ...Are?? into a population of 700 or more people, someone will shout back, ??Penn State??. We have tested that legend in a number of places on the globe & found that it is true. With half a million Alumni living in all parts of the planet, it is not a surprise that they will find one another, not only in Beaver Stadium but also on all 7 continents. So to all of you who are Nittany Lion fans, I shout, We...Are..."
5848,Date of experience: August 2019,2-Sep-19,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Should Be On Every College Football Fans Bucket List,"Beaver Stadium at Penn State University is one of the largest football stadiums in the country.  The stadium seats more than 107,000 fans and on game day the atmosphere is electric.  There are many web sites that will give you game day information about tickets and parking.  Because many of the parking lots are grass, they do close when there is excessive rain.  A stripe out or a white out are wonderful to view.  There is nothing better than spending a fall day in Happy Valley, and a Saturday with 110,000 of your best friends."

5852,Date of experience: October 2018,7-May-19,Big Ten,Penn state,5,An Excellent Place to Watch a Football Game,"This place is a lot of fun.  The football game is great, but being in the atmosphere of the stadium is awesome.  The tailgating before the game is a sight to behold, because it is so expansive and elaborate in some cases.  The student section in the game is fun to watch and full of energy.  And the best games to attend are the white out games.  Those games are usually the best and the energy in the stadium is awe inspiring.  There are a few things that are not so good.  The stadium seating is dated.  Most of the seating is like sitting in high school bleachers with no backs on the bench seating.  It would pay you to rent a cushioned seat with a back at the stadium, so you could be more comfortable.  Also getting into and especially out of the stadium area is a challenge.  It takes a long time because of the the volume of traffic.  So be ready for those two things.  Otherwise it is an unbelievable experience."

5858,Date of experience: November 2018,24-Nov-18,Big Ten,Penn state,1,Stay Away!,"The whole experience just sucked. First, we purchased a yellow parking pass only to get to the stadium and find out all the yellow lots were closed. We drove around the stadium to see if we could find a lot that would accept cash and there was nothing. We had to drive 6 miles out and shuttle from some zombie apocalypse mall (Nittany Mall). Due to the rain everyone was freezing and miserable so we were ready to drink. Get inside only to find out it??s a dry college! I??m sorry, am I at a high school football game? I don??t want hot cocoa and popcorn. Give me a beer son! Lastly the weather sucked. In any other circumstance I would not give a poor rating due to weather. But because the stadium sucked, the parking sucked, and the alcohol situation sucked I will blame the bad weather on Penn State. If you would like a great experience just travel south to the University of Maryland. The football team sucks but you can park right outside of the stadium. You can also purchase beer and drink while you watch the Terps lose."

Love the Nits but, wow, this experience was both exhilarating and depressing. They lost to OSU and should not have. Frustration was not being able to text as game progressed (bandwidth exceeded by 110 thousand fans). The white out was awesome, so few red dots in the stands. Most fans friendly to OSU attendees, but a few turkeys out there. Took forever to get in, but generally easy after entry (searches, crowds, drunk students (lots of these). Oh, but what a game--wish we had won...too much noise, lion roars, music, and, damn, the time outs for TV, etc. Should not take nearly 4 hours to play a game. And, certainly, one wonders how the teams have any continuity in their conduct of the game. Still, awesome event, fireworks, blimps, moon rising over the stands..."

Not sure how much has changed since then, but it was such a great day with so many special memories that I hold dear. Cheering on the Nittany Lions with 107k other die hard fans? Doesn't get much better than that! Super friendly staff and usually plenty of restrooms make for a happy lady fan. They are very strict on the clear bag policy, so keep that in mind. Also, give yourself plenty of time to get in and seated before the game starts or you might miss kick off! Don't forget to get some hot chocolate in a take home mug!"

It??s a fun place to be!  Be sure you arrive early because going through security takes a while.  No food/drinks can be carried in, and your personal items need to fit into a clear ziploc bag. Ladies, leave your purses at home. Also, if you need a parking permit, be sure to purchase it in advance. The cost goes up a lot on game day."

The bowl was completed, and the sides were extended! The seat span seems small. It felt crowded and some people near me were inched out of their seat number! I love PSU! It was 40 years since I returned back to a game.  For the few hours during the game, I felt like a sardine! However, be back was a blast from the past!  The ticket prices have increased significantly and make it difficult for me to go to any future games. I am glad I was able to return to my Alma mater for a game."

In the middle of PA, we flew to Pittsburgh and drove. GREAT SCENERY, PA is beautiful. The stadium has dual screens on each endzone which is great and open corners to see the PA mountains in the background. The parking is kind of a pain - you HAVE to have a parking pass or pay $25 to stay in a parking garage. But other than that, great experience!"
5893,Date of experience: November 2017,28-Nov-17,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Breathtaking stadium,"This is an awesome place to experience college football. Over 100,000 people are at every game, they're intense but not unpleasant, and they're going nuts the whole time. I've been to several NFL stadiums, but this one is even more impressive given its sheer width. We stayed in the club level seats, and the food up there is very good. Only three alcoholic drinks per person though."
5894,Date of experience: November 2017,18-Nov-17,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Football tailgating pretty good,Nice to have all the grassy area for tailgating.  Nice fans and polite to the visiting team.  Good experience.

The experience, especially during a ""big"" game, is mind blowing.  The experience is one that any Penn State football fan will remember forever.  Beaver Stadium itself is a bit dated - much has been discussed regarding a total remodel of the stadium (bathrooms are one example of something that needs updating).  That said, I believe they manage the venue very well, keep it very clean, and the ambience is second to none.  Go visit one of the largest & loudest college stadiums in the nation!"

Sharing food, booze and games in harmony. Plenty of port-a-potties, traffic patterns well planned and cops on horse back and security cameras in tailgating areas. Although all was peaceful it was nice to know they were there. Recycling & trash bags were available for any who forgot. Amazing experience everyone should try @ least once. Oh & the game was awesome too. Penn St won! ????????"

5903,Date of experience: September 2017,5-Oct-17,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Bucket List Experience,Been going to Beaver Stadium for 40 yrs. Great place to see great football. Lots of restrooms with plenty of places to grab some food. Over the years parking has gotten steadily worse. $40 bucks to park a mile away seems harsh. Tailgates are the best. Don't plan on getting home early and take something for that call of nature while you're sitting in miles of traffic on 322 that's after it took you an hour or so to get out one of the outer parking lots. It's just part of that game day experience.
5905,Date of experience: September 2017,3-Oct-17,Big Ten,Penn state,5,One of my favorite places to hang out with 107000 of my best friends!,"Beaver stadium is always so much fun just because of the game day atmosphere.  The bleachers are cold and it can be super uncomfortable, but it's all worth it to see the Nittany Lions Play!  The side under the press box gets the morning sun but you are sitting behind the opponent.  I still say this is better so you don't have the sun in your eyes for the entire game.  Be prepared to climb!"
5906,Date of experience: September 2017,2-Oct-17,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Football weekend,Tailgating at this school super fun.   My kdis have a blast coming here with my family one football game a year.   Always stop into Creamery too either before or after game.

5908,Date of experience: September 2017,25-Sep-17,Big Ten,Penn state,4,Oh What A Night!,"A great venue especially during warm, September, night games. The beautiful stadium has a wonderful scoreboard, adequate staff, security, concessions, and restrooms. I appreciate the availability of Berkey Cremery ice cream in the stadium but disappointed that it is no longer available outside the stadium. The one negative is the sound system that too often plays too loud and distracting musical amplification that lasts too long."
5909,Date of experience: September 2017,22-Sep-17,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Go Big Blue!,"This is one of the greatest stadiums ever!  Not a bad seat in the house.  You don't have to be a Penn State fan to enjoy football here, but why wouldn't you be.  Lots of concessions.  Fills and evacuates fairly quickly for the number of fans that attend.  Plenty of parking, which you must pay for.  Room for RVs.  Tailgating here is great!  Try it by all means."
5910,Date of experience: September 2017,20-Sep-17,Big Ten,Penn state,5,We Are.....Penn State,"A fantastic venue to watch a football game. What used to be an anual rivalry, has turned into a onxe in a while event, as the University of Pittsburgh played 4th ranked Penn State.

5911,Date of experience: September 2017,16-Sep-17,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Georgia State Night Game,Amazing stadium with an awesome football team playing. Great staff with most bribg friendly and helpful.  I've asked several for directions and places to park and some people up here are clueless. Warm temps made this night game even more enjoyable. Can't wait to come back!!!
5912,Date of experience: September 2017,14-Sep-17,Big Ten,Penn state,4,What an experience,I attended the Pitt/Penn State game at Beaver Stadium.  The crowd is electrifying even though I don't care for Penn State.  There is plenty of parking but you may have to walk about 15-20 minutes to get to the stadium.  They pack them in there tight.  There is not much room to scoot through once you are seated and you can barely move in the public areas at half time.  It is definitely something to see and they have a wonderful fan base.
5913,Date of experience: September 2017,13-Sep-17,Big Ten,Penn state,4,A classic stadium,"As one of the top 5 capacity stadia in the country, Beaver is a true classic.  Nowadays you have to have the typical security screening when entering which does create some lines.  We have sat several places over the years in the East stands, as long as you are 10 rows or so high you can see the whole field.  It's impossible not to be infected by the high enthusiasm of students and alumni.  They do need to improve the ""vintage"" restrooms, not up to modern stadia standards."
5914,Date of experience: September 2017,12-Sep-17,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Best Tailgate in College Football,I have been to many Big 10 school stadium's and Beaver Stadium offers the only one with stadium adjacent parking with enough space for GREAT Tailgating experiences.

5916,Date of experience: September 2017,10-Sep-17,Big Ten,Penn state,3,Scary,"Stadium has great views from every seat, but no room to get into and out of the seats. If you are a younger fan not an issue, us older folks a bit of an ordeal. Went out at half time and it was both scary and dangerous, there was literally not room to move either to, in, or our of restrooms or concessions. It is amazing that nobody gets crushed, really need to spend some money for updates. Big time program deserves modern, safe facilities!"

However, I've attended games in about a dozen other big-time stadiums, including Notre Dame, Michigan, the Rose Bowl, etc., and the atmosphere at Beaver Stadium beats them all hands down. Of course, I am factoring in the tailgating scene, which is better than anywhere I've been. If you've never been to Happy Valley for a football game you ought to put it on your bucket list!"

My husband and I try to go to a Game once a year . One piece of advice if you can help it get tickets with a seat back and not on a bleached seat it makes it much more enjoyable. We also try to get seats under cover because you never know what Mother Nature has in store. Love this place!
5936,Date of experience: September 2016,2-Jul-17,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Penn State Football!!,"Enjoyed going to Penn State Football as usual!  Lots of excitement in the stadium; lots of noise.  Stadium seat benches are tight, so once you are there, it's hard to get out.  Views are pretty good from anywhere in the stadium and the Blue Band performances can't be beat!"
5937,Date of experience: September 2016,27-Jun-17,Big Ten,Penn state,5,has seen better days,"Beaver Stadium is definitely a must do for a college sports fans bucket list.  Especially for a night ""white out"" game.  When the stadium is full of 107,000 screaming maniacs dressed mostly in white, there is no better atmosphere in all of college football.  However, the stadium is well past its expiration date and in my opinion should be put out of its misery.  Recent talks by Penn State university of sinking several 100 millions of dollars into ""refurbishing"" are beyond ludicrous.  Yes, it is an historic landmark.  But I think it should be replaced with something new.  Something modern with like oh I don't know better handicap access, bathrooms that work all the time, more bathrooms, better concession/souvenir stands, better seats, more suites, a more modern and accommodating press box, etc, etc.  Parking is at a premium and if you don't have a parking pass will currently cost you $40 in addition to the ticket price to get into the game.  You might end up parking a LONG ways away from the stadium requiring a long walk uphill and/or thru mud.  It is one of the best places in the country to wander the vast expanses of tailgates. This place is definitely worth a visit."
5938,Date of experience: November 2016,23-May-17,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Wow!,"What an exciting place to be when Penn State takes the field!  And, from there, it gets even better.  Excitement for players' efforts and successes, yet it is a down-home, have-a-good-time atmosphere.  Stadium-wide singing of favorites such as ""Sweet Georgia Brown"" add to the fun times."
5944,Date of experience: September 2016,6-Apr-17,Big Ten,Penn state,5,we are penn state,"Great place to see a game fun atmosphere bathrooms clean, the admission process stinks to high heaven to long and to complicated and the parking routine is horrid so goooo extremely early"
5946,Date of experience: September 2016,23-Mar-17,Big Ten,Penn state,4,Numerous Visits,Have made numerous visits for penn state games. The stadium is definitely old and could and will be getting some upgrades. Provides one of the best atmospheres in all of football.
5947,Date of experience: November 2016,21-Mar-17,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Best Atmosphere for Football!!!,Greatest College Football Arena. The best atmosphere you will find. From tailgating to the S-Zone to the student section the Beaver Stadium will definitely keep you on your toes and the student section will just keep you going. Whether it be the lion or the lionettes or the game itself. You will have the time of your life.
5948,Date of experience: November 2016,21-Feb-17,Big Ten,Penn state,5,This is a great stadium,"Beaver stadium is def one of the greatest football stadiums. If you re in the bottom third of the stadium it is like you are on the field. The fans are fantastic, I leave there every time full of energy."
5949,Date of experience: October 2016,19-Feb-17,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Awesome!!,"The atmosphere in Beaver stadium is terrific.  Fans are friendly.  It is always a good time at Beaver stadium for a football game.  Lots of food, fans and Fun!!"
5950,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Feb-17,Big Ten,Penn state,4,Incredible football experience,"If you want to experience authentic college football, this is the place to go.  The fan base is incredibly passionate and for a big game, they'll be a packed house of 107,000 (amazing considering the NFL stadiums are more like 70k).  If it's amenities you're looking for, well, they've got some work (ie modernizing) to do.  However, this is truly a special place and between the tailgating outside and the atmosphere inside, you'd be hard pressed to find anything else that rivals it."
5951,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Feb-17,Big Ten,Penn state,2,Close Friends?,"If you like to pay high prices for tickets only to be squeezed into a 12 inch bench seat separated by a painted line, Beaver Stadium is for you!"
5953,Date of experience: October 2016,26-Jan-17,Big Ten,Penn state,5,The place is just nuts!,"Is this place nuts or what! Went to the upset of the year, the PSU, Ohio State game. It was a night game, so the tailgating started, probably about 2 PM, so the place was liquored ..... er ...... rather fired up. It seats about 107,000 people, pretty much all dressed in white. You think you're watching a snow storm falling down from the stands. Seated in the upper section, end zone, I was surprised at the decent view that we had. This place is in the boonies, for sure, but If you've never been and you enjoy watching football, this setting is ""as good as it gets in college football"".However, if PSU is having a good season, you'll have to get tickets well in advance, as well as call the stadium to get a parking ticket."
5954,Date of experience: November 2016,17-Jan-17,Big Ten,Penn state,3,"If you love Penn State football, you will love Beaver Stadium","Great, large stadium hosting the best in Penn State football.  Seating is less than desirable as it is mostly bleacher seating (and small spaces, at that).  In need of updates, to say the least."
5955,Date of experience: August 2016,4-Jan-17,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Great football venue,"This is a great college football venue;  arguably unbeatable in atmosphere, especially during big games.It is a college stadium, so don't expect comfortable seating.  But definitely see a game here!"
5956,Date of experience: September 2016,4-Dec-16,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Football!,This is a huge Big 10 stadium amid views of mountains. Penn State has a great team and a beautiful marching band.
5957,Date of experience: November 2016,30-Nov-16,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Not a BAD SEAT IN THE HOUSE,"First visit was for the Big 10 championship on the line. What a great stadium. 90% of the seats put you right on top of the action, while the very top seats still provide a great view. Truly not a bad seat in the house. Be forewarned however, walking up the ramps to the mid and upper level seats require walking up STEEP inclines. As such, these seats are NOT ideal for anyone with a walking condition. In addition, the WIND is a BIG FACTOR when sitting up high, thus on a colder October and November day, be prepared!"
5958,Date of experience: November 2016,30-Nov-16,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Best College Show in the Country!,"I've attending PSU football games since 1982.  Same seats every year.  My dad got me hooked and now my kids are hooked.  If you only get to one college football game make it to Beaver Stadium.  Its' the biggest party you'll ever see.  100,000 plus people having a great time.  Don't expect flat concrete lots unless you have special or RV parking.  The lots are grassy and mostly rolling hills.  Bring a tailgating tent, table, grill, cooler full of beer and soda, games, and lots of food.  Go Lions!"
5959,Date of experience: October 2016,25-Nov-16,Big Ten,Penn state,5,What An Experience!,"We visited for the Ohio State game. What an experience it was to have 107,000 fans celebrate the upset win.  The experience was great, the facilities cannot accommodate this many people.  Massive lines for concessions and rest room is the reason it did not get 5 stars."
5960,Date of experience: November 2016,21-Nov-16,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Amazing Experience !,"I attended my first STATE game a few weeks ago.   What an amazing experience !  Great place, very nice area, lots of fun tailgates and great school pride!"
5961,Date of experience: November 2016,16-Nov-16,Big Ten,Penn state,5,INCREDIBLE ENERGY!,"Beaver stadium may have some challenges but it's still a great place to watch a football game. The seats are small and the amenities lack a little. But when you put over 100,000 faithful lions fans in there, the energy and excitement is the best I've experienced at a game. The tailgating is beyond belief!  Fans showed up the morning of our game at 8 a m ... The game was at 7:30 p m. There were a lot of drunks around pre-game. But they all had people taking care of them. Lots of free buses from the parking lots too. I highly recommend catching a game when you are in the area. They have just started concerts too. Blake Shelton was there a few days ago."
5962,Date of experience: November 2016,11-Nov-16,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Guest of Tailgaters,"Every year we get to go to one Penn State game with my sister in law.  Her and her husband graduated from Penn State and have been tailgaters for years.  They invite us and we cook and eat great food.  We meet new people and enjoy the day, the festivities and the people. I love it. The game is always fun, as we are sports fans.  I look forward to it."
5963,Date of experience: November 2016,8-Nov-16,Big Ten,Penn state,1,"Horrible long security lines, falling down drunks everywhere, seating much smaller than airline economy","Horrible long security lines that took us an hour and 15 minutes to get through (75 minutes), denied our clear bag that I use at NFL games and their web site lists as ok; plus  falling down drunks everywhere, and a confusing layout to find your seats with minimal signage.  With  5"" width of bench to sit on and zero leg room I longed for the luxurious comfort of a compact economy airline seat. Penn State should offer a refund."
5964,Date of experience: November 2016,8-Nov-16,Big Ten,Penn state,4,PSU Football,Nice place but could use some better seats other than the old school bench type seating. Overall clean and friendly but again needs a major remodel.
5965,Date of experience: October 2016,3-Nov-16,Big Ten,Penn state,4,Great atmosphere and fans but the stadium is an erector set,"Great tailgating, confusing parking if you are from a visiting school.  Once inside the sight lines are good but the construction of the stadium over time makes it a bit chopped up.  I have been up here for 4 games over the years.  Fans are great.  Stadium is packed.  Getting out is a mess if it's a night game it's worse"
5966,Date of experience: October 2016,1-Nov-16,Big Ten,Penn state,5,"Gotta go, Gotta go.","To all Penn State alumni or attendees.  If you haven't gone for a game, GO Go Go.  Depends on where you sit.  Luckily, my last game (as an a alumnus) was near the student section.  Always more exciting.  WE ARE....PENN STATE"

5970,Date of experience: October 2016,14-Oct-16,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Best stadium atmosphere in the country,"You come to beaver stadium for the atmosphere, the bleacher seats are terrible and you're packed in with 107k of your closest friends elbow to elbow but once the crowd gets going you dont care..You'd have to experience it to understand it."
5971,Date of experience: October 2016,9-Oct-16,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Roar Lions!,"Hang out with 100,000 friends to watch the Nittany Lions in action. The crowd is especially family friendly so don't be afraid to bring small children and grandparents."
5972,Date of experience: October 2016,8-Oct-16,Big Ten,Penn state,3,Long waits and cramped seats,"Is what await all that attend a game at Happy Valley's famous stadium. Because State College is a fairly small town, driving to the stadium takes forever with traffic build ups way back on 322. Then the parking which is another long wait and long walk. But the biggest flaw is the wait to get in. I've never waited so long to walk through a stadium's gate, nearly 20 minutes after entering the line I was only half way there when someone said another gate didn't have any line. The stadium clearly needs more gates. With the long lines out of the way I finally made my way to my seat. I'll admit for such a large stadium it was easy to navigate to my section. But for the seats, a long line of metal bleachers that were cramped to say the least. I was at the end of a bleacher next to a railing. I was so cramped I had to hang my arms over the railing and lean forward just to get what little comfort I was going to get. By halftime my rear hurt, my hamstrings hurt, and my back hurt. But on the positive side the fans are a passionate bunch that have true loyalty to their team. The atmosphere is really great as a result, and the fans were rowdy but were within manners of human society. I know Beaver Stadium is sacred to many PSU fans who couldn't imagine watching their team anywhere else, but for the average fan it's behind in times and in need of massive renovations or even replacement."
5973,Date of experience: October 2016,4-Oct-16,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Penn Stae vs Minnesota,"Yes, it was raining but had a blast of a time tailgating before the game and watching the team win...My first time at the stadium and parking...Friendly, people ...The purpose of our trip to visit our son and follow his advice..."".Gotta experience, a Penn State Game..!!! we did , no complaints"
5974,Date of experience: September 2016,4-Oct-16,Big Ten,Penn state,4,Small feel for a large stadium,I never got the feeling the place holds 107k people. It looks smaller. Once sitting in the stadium it's a nice look and feel and the surprising thing was you're not that far away from the field. The outside and underneath the seats isn't attractive. As one PSU person told me - it's a big erector set. Of the 10 Big 10 stadiums I've been too I think these home town people were the nicest we've encountered.
5975,Date of experience: October 2016,2-Oct-16,Big Ten,Penn state,4,Road Trip Game,Bought tickets thru our University and opponents sit up high in the corner. Rows 60-75 ish. Long walk up and bleachers don't give ample room for legs or hips. It's tight and we were at the end of the row against the rail. You feel trapped and it's super hard getting up to get anything during game. Positive note there are bathrooms and concessions way up high.  Pulled pork ok. Do not get the hamburger (cold and nasty). PSU fans are nice. Only frat boys harassed us which is great compared to other stadiums. View is good from way up high but gets cold. Would recommend going
5976,Date of experience: September 2016,27-Sep-16,Big Ten,Penn state,5,A great venue for college football,"This stadium should be on every college football fans bucket list.  Specifically a night game when Penn State plays Ohio State or Michigan.  This stadium rocks with over 100,000 fans!  Do expect long lines at halftime for food though."
5977,Date of experience: September 2016,26-Sep-16,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Great Place for a Game,"I've been here countless times, as I was a student at Penn State. Came up a couple weeks ago for the game against Temple. The energy is always amazing inside the stadium. Just be sure to have meals planned either before or after because the food is ridiculously expensive for its quality."
5978,Date of experience: September 2016,21-Sep-16,Big Ten,Penn state,4,One of the largest staduims in the nation and handles it easily,"Beaver stadium is a treat to watch a football game. Larger than most pro stadiums but the view of the field still felt intimate. There is always a large student crowd and the energy and school pride is really enjoyable.  Fun stadium, really enjoyed the environment and the game.  The tailgating was over the top, it was everywhere there was a field to park in.  Amazing, the largest tailgating event I have ever seen.  The whole day was great and the tailgating kept going strong well after the game.  FUN!"
5979,Date of experience: September 2016,21-Sep-16,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Football atmosphere at it's best,Beaver Stadium has the best fans. They have a lot of restrooms and food stations throughout the stadium. Seats are not too narrow. Parking is close. The process to get into the stadium is fast and orderly. The ushers are helpful and keep things under control for those very few that a few to many before kickoff. Tailgating is one of the best in the country.
5980,Date of experience: September 2016,20-Sep-16,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Great place to watch a game,Beaver Stadium is a outstanding place to experience College football. The tailgate party's are fantastic. In the parking lots they have plenty of porta-potty's. And provide bags for trash and recycling.Friendly staff at the Stadium and the game announcer Dean is the best in the nation.
5981,Date of experience: September 2016,19-Sep-16,Big Ten,Penn state,2,This Stadium Really Needs Updating,"Going to Beaver Stadium is a FANTASTIC experience.  The Lions playing football, the band, cheerleaders, dancers, students and great fans.  I have been going for, well let's just say many years.  Also for many years it has been an annual outing with my daughter.  It is too bad most of the good seats are on too small benches.  Has anyone looked at the size of some Americans these days.  We need seats.  In the row in front of us in WF four large people made it impossible for a man to sit in that row.  Wall to wall people with him out.  Fortunately he had a seat in our row.  Also vending and bathrooms seem like they are from the original 500 seat Beaver Field.  Given the revenue from the stadium, vending and parking, please update."
5982,Date of experience: September 2016,19-Sep-16,Big Ten,Penn state,2,OK.. but the drunks are getting out of hand..,"I have been going to PSU games for over 40 years. usually 2 or 3 a season.. We always had fun tailgating and with the crowds.. this past weekend the drunk kids really seems to be getting out of hand.. didn't really care what they yelled or how old the kids were they were yelling it to??? I'm one for a good time.. but yelling F-U (enter the school name) and he school name to young kids (8,10,y.o. etc).. because they are wearing the visiting teams shirt is a little much..or adults in their 40s standing in line to get into a game trying to start problems with visiting fans that are greatly out numbered with off color remarks....... whatever the case if State College doesn't address the issue before it becomes a problem.. Beaver Stadium will have the same problems as most pro stadiums have with only corporate money and drunks going to the game.. which is a real shame.. because it has a strong tradition of being a great venue to see a college game..It will be a while before I go back to this site... there are to many other college venues that welcome visitors and the $$ they planing to spend"

As of late there is always an electricity in the stadium, mostly generated by a great student section. Bench style seats in most of stadium, and don't expect much elbow room. Concessions are priced right, but selection has been decreasing each year."

5986,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,Big Ten,Penn state,1,Drive by,A fairly unattractive amalgam of expansions and unsightly growth. Avoid it on selected Saturdays when traffic is absurd. On other days avoid it because nothing is going on.
5987,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Best tailgating and fans in the country!,"You haven't lived until you step inside Beaver Stadium on game day.  Hearing 100,000 people roaring ""We Are"" at the top of their lungs is electrifying. The only thing that might make it a better experience would be if they sold beer in the stadium! I highly recommend springing for seat backs for the bleachers, not only to they add comfort, but they also help define your seat."

Great football at Beaver Stadium."
5995,Date of experience: August 2016,27-Aug-16,Big Ten,Penn state,1,A scar on the landscape,"Besides the ugly exterior that looks like a better stadium after demolition (steel beams exposed, haphazard placement of walkways, ugly grey/beige color), this monstrosity shines the field lights every night, destroying any chance for the State College area may have had for stargazing. Furthermore, as a resource that is used maybe 10 times per year it's nothing but a well lit eyesore."
5996,Date of experience: December 2015,14-Aug-16,Big Ten,Penn state,5,WE ARE...!,"So much fun. Great times every time I go to Beaver Stadium (unless its frigid cold). Everyone feeds off of each other in terms of the electric energy. People are rowdy, but very friendly. It's really a wonderful experience. This isn't even a question if you're at Penn State and it's football season."
5997,Date of experience: November 2015,11-Aug-16,Big Ten,Penn state,4,local icon,"Growing up here, I've gotten to watch this stadium grow and change.  It's been updated and modernized considerably.  They now have state of the art scoreboards and big screens visible from anywhere.  While it's a big stadium, the seats are close enough to the field to give you a good feel, unlike the Big House in Michigan where it seems you are a mile away.There's nothing like experiencing a tailgate here on game day."
5998,Date of experience: October 2015,4-Aug-16,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Town Landmark,"I admit the stadium may not be the most attractive in the country (though far from ugly), and some seats aren't the most comfortable. However, its the history and the people that make this place great. There is nothing like being inside this stadium during a white out foot ball game with 110,00 other screaming fans.  The field is well taken care of by the university and always looks great. Though we don't always agree with the no alcohol policy, it does keep the stadium clean and nice. Restrooms are great and love visiting the sports museum. You can even get married there if you want. Place to make you Penn State proud."

The students and alumni are just awesome.  They say that they bleed blue and white and they aren't kidding.  The stadium is very easy to get to - it's  right off of Interstate 99 in State College, PA.  The atmosphere is amazing.  Game days are very competitive - but in good fun.  There is ample parking - unless it has rained.  If it has rained, then RV parking and some auto parking is limited.  Concessions at the stadium are pretty good - the usual stadium foods like hot dogs and burgers.  I always get ice cream from the Penn State Creamery.  The stadium is starting to show its age.  I understand that there are some needed improvements on the way.  If you come for a game weekend - bring your earplugs if you don't like noise.  Because Penn State fans make some serious noise!"

It isn't the newest, nor the most comfortable, but the atmosphere is unrivaled. 107,000 fans dressed in white chanting ""WE ARE...PENN STATE"" is enough to give even opposing fans (I brought a friend who is an OSU fan to a game) chills. The team may not be championship caliber now, but this stadium is a must visit for anyone who is a college football aficionado. Everyone should visit this place at least once."

6016,Date of experience: November 2015,7-Mar-16,Big Ten,Penn state,5,An Iconic part of Penn State and the local Landscape,"Beaver stadium is impressive!  When you comfortably hold over 110,000 people - it's hard not to be!  As big as it is, most seats offer a great view of the game - even those in the upper deck.   The elements can be a concern - especially for seats that aren't under cover - but not always because of precipitation!  Seats on the home side can get quite a bit of sun!  Bring your sunscreen!  We have seen it grow from a ""U"" of 65,000, to where it is today.  It is a wonderful place to see a football game.  At one point, ESPN dubbed it the best venue in the US for college football.  Add it to your bucket list!"

6020,Date of experience: November 2015,1-Dec-15,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Penn State Football,11/21/15 -Greatest place to see a football game. It all starts with tail gating. The stadium is beautiful and FULL of spirit. WE ARE ! If you ever want see a College Football Game this is the place.
6022,Date of experience: November 2015,27-Nov-15,Big Ten,Penn state,3,Needs a major upgrade,"I've been a season ticket holder for 30 years, and only recently realized how unfriendly it is to handicapped individuals.

6027,Date of experience: September 2015,19-Oct-15,Big Ten,Penn state,4,Clean and Well Managed,"The biggest disadvantage is the very tight seating, especially if surrounded by larger people or people who rent the stadium cushioned seating. When behind those in the rented seats, it is like an airline.  The people tend to lean back on the backrest and take up more of your leg space. If you can get tickets near an isle you'll have a little more room."

Stadium is clean and most seats have excellent views of the field.  Parking can be quite a hike, so allow extra time to walk from car to stadium.  Great views of the surrounding Happy Valley from the upper decks of Beaver Stadium.  New scoreboard is hugh, and displays high quality graphics and videos."
6030,Date of experience: September 2015,5-Oct-15,Big Ten,Penn state,5,Football!!!  Nittany Lions!!!  Tailgating!!!,"This is fun for the whole family.  The stadium holds 110,000 people and there are games when it is mostly full.  We were at the PSU vs. Rutgers game which attracted over 103,000 attendees.  It was a ""striped"" game with fans wearing either navy blue or white depending on their seat section.  Despite the large crowd everything is well organized and under control.  For tailgating you can pick up free bags for waste and for recycling to make it easy to keep things in order.  Great crowd.  Fun day.  Everyone will have a great time."

6034,Date of experience: October 2021,21-Oct-21,Big Ten,Prudue,5,Cradle of quarterbacks,"Ross-Ade Stadium in West Lafayette, Indiana, home of the Purdue Boilermakers football team, isn't a postcard type of facility. But I'll always remember it marked the first time I saw Bob Griese. It was 1966 and Griese led Purdue past Illinois 25-21. Built in 1924, with a seating capacity of 13,500, comparable to the lower portion of the current facility's west grandstand, it now seats 62,500 and features an upper deck to the east side of the stadium, a new press box with a four-story pavilion, a media center, 34 luxury suites and a 200-seat indoor club level, an expanded main concourse, a patio area for fans to enjoy a more party-like atmosphere and a new grand staircase at the south end of the stadium. Two distinctive features of Purdue's All-American Marching Band are the world's largest drum and the solo baton twirler, the Purdue Golden Girl. With 373 members, it is one of the largest marching bands in the world. Most importantly, Purdue is known as the Cradle of Quarterbacks, having produced several All-America quarterbacks who went on to fame in the National Football League, including Bob DeMoss, Dale Samuels, Len Dawson, Bob Griese, Mike Phipps, Gary Danielson, Mark Hermann, Jim Everett and Drew Brees. Unlike some colleges, Purdue doesn't retire numbers of famous players. But Purdue is represented by 18 inductees in the College Football Hall of Fame, including Griese, Phipps, Hermann, Bump Elliott, Alex Agase, Rod Woodson, Leroy Keyes, Dave Buts and Otis Armstrong."
6035,Date of experience: October 2018,6-Mar-19,Big Ten,Prudue,5,Great big 10 football venue.,"Walking distance from Purdue University Campus. Great food and space for gathering, here and all around campus.  Stay at fabulous Black Blanket Farms Bed & Breakfast for the games."
6036,Date of experience: November 2018,27-Jan-19,Big Ten,Prudue,3,Not a Power 5 stadium,"Having been to a couple Big Ten, SEC, and Pac 12 stadiums, this one lacks that atmosphere. Actually it??s about half the size of many. People were all very nice, minus one overzealous Purdue fan. Seemed like a decent amount of parking nearby. Some of our group parked somewhere and had to shuttle in. Got to see a great game at least and they had 3 military guys parachute in."
6037,Date of experience: November 2018,19-Dec-18,Big Ten,Prudue,4,College football experience,I wanted to get away for my birthday weekend and enjoy a good football game I managed to find an area drivable from Mooresville North Carolina that afforded both a college and professional game in the same weekend. I was treated to a close for big 10 football contest I was able to secure first row seats in the end zone which while not ideal for viewing a game gave a different perspective and afforded me the opportunity to appreciate the size and speed of the players. The sightlines were excellent my view was on obstructed the college atmosphere was electric and I had an awesome time.
6038,Date of experience: November 2018,20-Nov-18,Big Ten,Prudue,5,Football game.,Fans were great to visitors. The seats were very reasonably priced.  We had a nice tailgate area.  Only complaint is we had a slippery ride to get to our tailgate spot.

Great typical stadium to visit, see a game, and hang out after.  Great crowd, vibe and good vendors.  You will love it.  #boilerup"
6042,Date of experience: September 2018,14-Oct-18,Big Ten,Prudue,3,Room to Improve,"Let me start by saying that I'm a lifelong Purdue fan. I love Purdue sports and give Mackey Arena a perfect 5 star rating. I would give it  a 6 if I could. It's perfect. But in all honesty, Ross-Ade is just ok. It's definitely not a terrible place to watch a game, but it's not an especially memorable place either. I come here because I love Purdue sports, but I don't love the actual stadium. Coach Brohm has brought back interest in Purdue football, so attendance is up. Which is wonderful! But the atmosphere is still lacking compared to the electricity you see at other Big Ten stadiums. For whatever reason, Ross-Ade just doesn't get super loud. When the place does start to get loud, it's often at the wrong time. A lot of the fans cheer loudly (and keep cheering loudly) when we're on offense and make a great play, which makes it hard for our offense to hear in the huddle. And I can't count how many times I've been one of the only people standing and yelling on a crucial third down on the defensive end. The student section is pretty decent, but certainly not on the same level as the Paint Crew at Mackey.The concourse areas aren't very welcoming (just a bunch of concrete), and they get VERY crowded. The bathrooms do too. For whatever reason, the Ross-Ade renovations in the early 2000's just didn't have the same positive effect on the concourse areas as the ones at Mackey a few years ago did.I can't ever get a cell phone signal at Ross-Ade. No idea why. If I'm there for 4 hours, I have a signal for maybe 15 minutes total.Parking can be a real challenge at Ross-Ade, and many out of town guests really struggle with this. The banned items and bag policy (clear bags only) has gotten incredibly restrictive as well. They even banned seat cushions, which is absolutely asinine. I absolutely despise the South End Zone patio area. It takes fans out of their seats and makes the stadium look more empty. It also doesn't look appealing. When they initially established this area, it was supposed to be temporary. I sure hope that's still the case and that they have a good plan for this area.Phase II of the Ross-Ade Renovation plan calls for an upper deck on the east side of the stadium. This would be a phenomenal addition in my opinion, as it would add a significant number of good (centered) seats. It would also provide a unique/signature look for Ross-Ade that a lot of other college stadiums don't have. If they were to add that upper deck, they could remove what's left of the south bleachers and perhaps re-design the horseshoe area a bit too.Despite my criticisms, I do think Purdue really is trying to create a better environment at Ross-Ade. Permanent lighting has allowed us to schedule more night games, which do have a unique energy and atmosphere. The new sound system is definitely better. AD Bobinski has earned my respect and confidence, and I have no doubt that a day will come when I'm more satisfied with Ross-Ade if he stays at the helm."
6043,Date of experience: September 2018,13-Oct-18,Big Ten,Prudue,3,Purdue vs Missouri,"Nice game day experience. Arrive early to find more parking options navigate traffic on campus. Although the stadium is at the edge of campus , game day traffic can be a headache due to pedestrian traffic and tight streets."
6044,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Oct-18,Big Ten,Prudue,4,Yes!  They sell beer here!,"College football at Purdue has its challenges, but with last years bowl bid and they're getting it together this year it looks to be another good year for the Boilermakers.  So, if you go to a game there is an added bonus of having a beer.  Also, it really is easy in and easy out of the stadium.  Enjoy!"
6045,Date of experience: September 2017,14-Aug-18,Big Ten,Prudue,5,Football,Great place to watch a college football game. They now have a Beer garden in the South End Zone. It is also a lot of fun tail great in the parking lot. Go boilers!
6047,Date of experience: November 2017,6-Dec-17,Big Ten,Prudue,4,"Some things excellent, others not so much","It's a bit of a challenge to rate a stadium as a whole but there are some specific points that are worth noting.  It's a bit of a old school facility, mostly bleacher seating and you're not allowed to bring in your own portable seat back.  Season tix holders can rent them for the season.  The new lights are fun and when they do the light show in a night game after a win it's totally cool.  I've got no beef about the parking as you can park for just $10 in the University St. garage which is just down the street, but they don't advertise that very well.  Our son is in the marching band, so we think the music program is beyond excellent.  Really, the All American Marching Band is one of the best in the country and an outstanding part of the game day experience.  Our biggest complaint this season was that the concession stands were constantly running out of things, several of the food choices one day, ice at the concession stands another day, water on a hot September game day.  Purdue had a better than expected season and attendance was up, but you gotta plan ahead and that they failed to do on several occasions."
6048,Date of experience: November 2017,9-Nov-17,Big Ten,Prudue,3,Big Ten Football,"I'm not sure on what basis you rate a football stadium.  Ross-Ade is an older facility (1924) recently renovated with wide concourses and lots of food options.  There is a south end zone area where alcohol is available.  The biggest drawback (other than the quality of the team) is parking, which is limited relative to other Big Ten schools, and its location which is on the other side of town from the Interstate, and so somewhat confusing for out of town fans to get to."
6049,Date of experience: October 2017,28-Oct-17,Big Ten,Prudue,5,Great night game experience,We had seats in section 32 very near the end zone. We love seeing the band come on to the field.  Rooting for the Huskers to beat the Boilermakers.

Spirited fan base - at least until they started getting behind..."
6051,Date of experience: September 2017,24-Sep-17,Big Ten,Prudue,2,Hmmmm,We were at this stadium for the Michigan - Purdue game in September of 2017. I get the sense that this stadium is not used to a sellout (which this game was). I can't even begin to describe the chaos in the concourses. It was nearly impossible to move. It took 10 minutes to go from section   105 back to 103 after getting some snacks about 30 minutes before game start. Later someone went back to get more snacks at the beginning of the 3rd quarter. They didn't return until the start of the 4th quarter. The seating was extremely cramped. The views from our seat were great - and there probably aren't many bad seats in the stadium. Nice Jumbotron in the end zone. We tried to park in one of the official lots and were turned away because they only accepted pre-paid parking passes. We ended up parking for free on the street in a nice neighborhood less than 1/2 mile from the stadium.
6052,Date of experience: October 2016,24-May-17,Big Ten,Prudue,5,Great Place for a Game and Other Events,"I'm a season ticket holder for Purdue and goto most of the games.

6053,Date of experience: October 2016,20-Apr-17,Big Ten,Prudue,5,The cradle of quarterbacks,"My fondest memories of Purdue University's Ross-Ade Stadium were flying over the stadium on a flight in a two-engine Piper Cub from Columbia, South Carolina, to Chicago's O'Hare Airport after completing six months of Army training in 1963 and watching future Hall of Fame quarterback Bob Griese beat my alma mater Illinois 25-21 en route to the Rose Bowl in 1966. Ross-Ade Stadium was built in 1924 with a seating capacity of 13,500. Today, after several additions and renovations, its seating capacity is 62.500. Purdue football is noted for two things: its reputation for being the cradle of quarterbacks and its world-famous marching band. Griese is perhaps the most famous of many outstanding quarterbacks developed at Purdue over the years. Others include Dale Samuels, Len Dawson, Drew Brees, Mark Herrmann, Mike Phipps and Gary Danielson. But a Saturday afternoon at Ross-Ade Stadium is more that a football game. The 389-member marching band, which has been the host band for the Indianapolis 500 since 1927, is noted for the World's Largest Drum, the Purdue Golden Girl featured twirler and the Block P, the first field formation ever created by a marching band in 1907. In 2014, Purdue introduced another unique renovation. The bleachers in the south end zone, which seated 6,100 spectators, were removed to make room for a Patio area for fans to enjoy a party-like atmosphere with tables and concessions. From the air or the 50-yard line or the Patio, it's always an exhilarating experience to attend a football game at Ross-Ade Stadium."
6054,Date of experience: November 2016,28-Nov-16,Big Ten,Prudue,4,Decent Stadium,"Saw the Wisconsin game, Purdue lost, but enjoyed the warm bathrooms, snack selections, reasonable prices and the beer tent. Excellent marching band!"

6056,Date of experience: September 2016,9-Nov-16,Big Ten,Prudue,3,Home of Purdue Boilermaker Football,"Purdue football program has struggled, but it's not for lack of the venue.  There have been several recent updates...some well received, others, not as much.  Personally, I could live without the jumbo tron and enjoy the live game day atmosphere.   But it's a clean, safe place to visit with a decent amount of parking within a reasonable distance and great tailgating."
6057,Date of experience: October 2016,18-Oct-16,Big Ten,Prudue,5,Nice Seating No crown,I've been to many stadiums to watch football games. I have to say the field at Ross Ade Stadium is great to watch a game from anywhere in the stadium. The field has very little or no crown to it. Many stadiums have so much crown you can't see the other side of the field. I was surprised and it made for a very enjoyable day. Thanks
6058,Date of experience: August 2016,6-Oct-16,Big Ten,Prudue,3,"No Lights, No Energy","Ross-Ade is a bowl-shaped stadium with a massive press box on the west-side.  The stadium is better than average structurally and the overall access to the game is easy.  Situated next to Mackey arena, it's in a prime spot on campus.However, there are no lights at Ross-Ade.  THe Boilermakers always play in the middle of the day with no prime-time.  There is a massive sinkhole in one of the end zones and the sun will absolutely fry you.  WItht the current performance of Purdue football it is very low energy, my advice is to wait for basketball season."

6063,Date of experience: November 2015,19-May-16,Big Ten,Prudue,4,Big 10 Football,"Went to a Purdue vs Illinois State football game during Purdue's homecoming weekend last November.  It was my first time to a Big-Time College football game.  Being from CT teams are not as big nor are the stadiums as in the Big 10 and other conferences.  Purdue has not been playing well so the stadium was not full, but it was a good time.  The pre-game ritual with the ""Drum"", apparently the biggest in the world was very enjoyable.  The Purdue band was also very good as were the all the other performers.  The game was not great as far as college football games go, but it was a pleasure to attend a game as Ross-Ade Stadium."

6065,Date of experience: October 2015,16-Jan-16,Big Ten,Prudue,5,Boilers!,"Always a fun day at Ross-Ade Stadium. No bad seats here, even in the end zone. You are close to all the action and the stadium is relatively easy to move around in. Expect to see Purdue Pete, cheerleaders, recruits, the AAMB, and maybe even the ex-governor. The food is pretty good, but expect to pay event prices. The brats are the best! Buy the $8 cup for free refills on Coke products. The All American Marching Band is the best you will ever see.....don't go to the concessions during halftime! The Band puts on an incredible show all day long starting out with warm ups on the practice field at 7:30 am! Meet the members (400+) at breakfast tailgating and then follow them throughout the campus as the march first to Mackey Arena for the 211 pep session, then into Ross Ade for the pregame show, then the half time show. Stick around for the post game show, then march alongside the band to Slayter Hill for a mini concert! This happens every home game! Remember to bring sunscreen and dress for the weather."

Go when there is no ball game scheduled unless you want to pay for parking.  Neighbors will sell you a spot on their lawns if you are going to the game.  Bring warm clothing, an umbrella and walking shoes.  If you lose your voice cheering, there is no lost-and-found for that.  Well policed; you will be safe in the mob."
6073,Date of experience: September 2014,30-Jun-15,Big Ten,Prudue,4,Great food from a stadium,Purdue changed food vendors and the new vendor has excellent quality food at very good prices.  There are no exorbitant stadium prices for the food (drinks can be steep except sodas are bottomless).

They are beautifully appointed, down to being glass-enclosed, but with a split window in front that actually goes up and down to allow more of the ""feel"" of being at the game, which can be closed when the wind and weather act up!This is the way to watch a football game - far better than on TV at home, but with all the comforts of home!"
6080,Date of experience: October 2014,14-Oct-14,Big Ten,Prudue,5,Many Thrilling Memories from this Place,"Being a Purdue alum we come at this from a slanted perspective admittedly.  But with that being said the new renovations made for this season has been an upgrade in functionality and appeal.  Gone are the ""old"" bleacher style seating.  In its place a beer garden serving of all things beer and wine.  Speaking with other teams visiting fans there is some envy in their desire to visit and longing for such a progressive approach to game day at their stadiums.  It has been a very nice perk for season ticket holders to be able to go to this garden before and during Purdue home football games.  Beyond the recent upgrade to the stadium, I have been a long standing season ticket holder.  I have witnessed great feats and great defeats at this memory packed venue.  I know others denigrate this stadium, but I have found few college football stadiums that I would say are better than this stadium (granted that list of college stadiums we have visited equals only10 so I admit to a limited observation group) .  In my estimation there are few better places to spend a fall Saturday in Indiana than Ross-Ade Stadium."

6082,Date of experience: September 2014,1-Sep-14,Big Ten,Prudue,4,One of my favorite places in the world...but,"I'm a Purdue alum and big Purdue fan, so I love being in Ross-Ade on a gameday Saturday. That said, it's by far from a great place to watch a game; but not because of the building itself.The sight lines are pretty good from almost any seat in the main stands...and the Shively Club is a good place to watch the game as well...But Purdue fans aren't the best group of people to be around, especially if you're a Purdue fan that likes to cheer.Sure, there are good fans in the place, of course...but if you want to stand during a key defensive stand or just like being loud, you'll probably be called out by a fellow Boilermaker...I have been probably 25 times- and that stinks. I don't curse or call out players, yet many fellow Purdue fans are bothered by noise...at a football game.If you're visiting, you should have no problem from your hosts. The food is good and relatively affordable for a sports venue and the concourses are wide since the revamp over a decade ago. The stadium has a good score board, TVs in the concourse and is clean."
6083,Date of experience: October 2013,23-Jul-14,Big Ten,Prudue,3,The Athletics Department Knows How To Kill The Game Day Atmosphere.,"The stadium itself is mostly fine.  It went through a rehab in the early 2000s.  The concourses are wider, there are plenty of vendors for food and drinks, and the restrooms are far nicer than they used to be.  There are TVs around so you can keep up with the game if you're not in your seat.  The biggest problem with the stadium from a physical point of view is the benches need to have 2 or 4 seats removed, then remark the remaining seats with the extra 2-3 inches of space from the removed seating.  If everyone shows up for a row it gets really tight.  Given the lack of attendance the past few years due to a very uncompetitive team, shrinking the capacity to under 56,000 might not be a bad idea.The biggest problem with the gameday experience is more systematic of college football in general and not specific to only Ross-Ade Stadium.  In the quest to pursue the almighty dollar the massive Jumbotron runs everything during the game.  Plenty of commercials for you to watch.  Lots of self promotion to other things related to Purdue.  A third of halftime will be spent honoring a past team or a current team for another sport.  If you think a football game should have the band play fight songs or entertaining music, with the cheerleaders doing things to get the crowd into the game you're not going to like 21st Century college football.  If you want an experience similar to what you can get by staying home and watching the TV, then you'll like what you get in modern college football.To top it off, the football team just hasn't been good the past few years.  It is one thing to play well yet still lose the game.  It is another to watch your team be simply be uncompetitive.  Who wants to pay money to watch that?"
6084,Date of experience: November 2013,12-Nov-13,Big Ten,Prudue,2,Quietest game day atmosphere ever,"We went to Purdue for the first time to cheer on the Iowa Hawkeyes. We went anticipating local food vendors outside the stadium and fun, rowdy fans. No. It was so quiet, no vendors, no excitement. We decided to go on in to the stadium. Many of the restrooms don't open until 1/2 hour before game time. The food was not great. The brats were dull, no sauerkraut available. Nothing very interesting. The rest of the experience was fan-based. Purdue fans were nice people, and clearly dejected. It seemed as if half the sparse stadium were Hawkeye fans. We had a great time and a great win, but it was sad to see a mass exodus of Purdue fans by the fourth quarter."
6086,Date of experience: September 2020,28-Mar-21,Big Ten,Rutgers,5,Rutgers Rah!,Don't let the name fool you.  This is a great place to watch a football game.  I would even recommend it for a family outing.
6087,Date of experience: October 2019,20-Oct-19,Big Ten,Rutgers,4,Rutgers Football - Scarlet Knights at Shi Stadium,"I have never been a fan of Football, my husband loves the NFL, but never really rooted for a College Team; my daughter started Rutgers this year; so hubby decided to buy season passes.   The first game we went to was excellent.  Rutgers won the game and had the best fireworks show I've ever seen.  They have since lost the last 2 games that we went to, but we still had a good time.   Throughout the game I'm having fun watching  the dance team,  marching band and Mascot.  They are really good and entertaining.  Every time Rutgers scores a touchdown, a Scarlet Knight rides on his horse across the field.   This is a fun event to do with the friends, family and kids.  If you are bringing a bag, it must be clear - or very, very small like a clutch purse.  The police outside the stadium check bag size.  Look up the requirements before you go,  this is common place now in stadiums - not just this one.   They also have lockers to rent in case the bag is too big."
6089,Date of experience: January 2023,19-Jan-23,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Stadium is nice - Be aware of  Rose Bowl parking,The Rose Bowl Stadium is perfectly nice. I wrote this review to make readers aware of the parking situation for the Rose Bowl game. For the most part the parking is on an adjacent golf course. The parking was $50 and for that price you could be parked close to the stadium (if you arrive early enough) or as far as a 15 minute walk across the ups and downs of the grass of the golf course.
6090,Date of experience: January 2023,9-Jan-23,Big Ten,UCLA,3,The Rose Bowl has lost it's bloom!,"We enjoyed the football game at the Rose Bowl on Jan. 2, 2023.  The stadium itself leaves much to be desired.  Very, very old. No amenities to speak of. Very few vendors selling items inside.  Pricy!  Lines everywhere for concessions, souvenirs and bathrooms.  Getting out of the place after the game - a total nightmare.  Very poor lighting outside the stadium, poor signage, no one directing people to buses. Really took the bloom off the Rose.  Bad ending to a good day!  Will not be back until many changes are made."
6091,Date of experience: January 2023,8-Jan-23,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Decent experience.. But??.,We were excited to see our Utah Utes play Penn state in the Rose bowl game.. Stadium is old and doesn??t have any bells and whistles. Very dysfunctional  in and out access. Been there now and probably won??t be back..parking is horrible on the golf course.
6093,Date of experience: January 2023,4-Jan-23,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Time for an update!,The Rose Bowl stadium is all history and needs to be updated. The stadium is antiquated. Getting there is not overly complicated. Leaving on the other hand was awful. You are better off walking back to downtown Pasadena. All the vendors are outside.
6094,Date of experience: November 2022,21-Nov-22,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Iconic Stadium,The experience was amazing. Highly recommend watching a game in this iconic stadium. Not a bad seat in the stadium.
6095,Date of experience: November 2022,20-Nov-22,Big Ten,UCLA,2,Not great,As Stadiums go I've seen a lot of them.  This one has the history and is worth seeing a game in once but it is an AWFUL stadium.  All food and restrooms are on the outside so its a long walk to the seats.  Getting out with the crowd after the game took over an hour.  Yes.  We won't be back.
6101,Date of experience: January 2022,11-Feb-22,Big Ten,UCLA,5,"Beautiful stadium, easy access","We saw the Rose Bowl in 2022. In the midst of the COVID crisis, they did an excellent job of screening people and making sure we were as safe as possible under the circumstances. The stadium in easy to get into and out of. The parking and traffic can be rough. We walked two miles to get there and back, and probably got as good timing as many who drove."
6102,Date of experience: January 2022,9-Jan-22,Big Ten,UCLA,5,A record setting Grandaddy of em all!,"Save for the loss to Michigan and snowflakes in Seattle being unable to handle a little snow it wouldn't have happened.  2022 wasn't supposed to begin in California, and all signs pointed to another Buckeye's CFP appearance.  But like the rest of last year a last minute scramble found plans changed with the family at the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day.From the records set to Utah's impressive fanbase it was a ""granddaddy of them all"" for the ages, with excellent crowd management from start to finish!"
6103,Date of experience: October 2021,25-Oct-21,Big Ten,UCLA,1,UCLA/Duck Football Game,"My experience at the Rose Bowl for the football game on October 23rd was an absolute nightmare. My family and I missed most of the first half of the game due to the vaccination/COVID check lines. We waited in line for about an hour with tons of people. When we got to the front, there were only TWO people checking vax cards. Only six tents operating the checks all around the stadium. The organization of this could not have been worse. At any other football stadium, you show your ticket and proof of vacciation at the ticket check. I don't understand why the Rose Bowl has not adopted that idea. I hope that there are more tents set up for future games, so that people can actually have the chance to watch the game that they are paying to attend."
6104,Date of experience: September 2021,4-Sep-21,Big Ten,UCLA,4,A destination game experience,The lines to get in could??ve been better spread out and more conducive to effective flow.  Limited concessions - had to go to 3 places just to get a hot dog (including 2 that advertised hot dogs).  Good sight lines to the field.  Suggest a seat cushion - at a minimum.
6107,Date of experience: January 2020,5-Feb-20,Big Ten,UCLA,3,"Beautiful Stadium, but they won't let you see much","We came by the Rose Bowl... everyone in our Business Group was either BigTen or PAC12 alumni.   The plaza in front was cool, to see all the schools and the named bricks.   The stadium is pretty amazing to look at.   The park in the area is really nice.WHILE I liked the plaza, it was a little disappointing to not be able to see any more of the stadium.   It was a Thursday afternoon in January ... nothing going on, and a guard at the gate, but he wouldn't let us in, even just for a minute to look around.   MANY other stadiums have one portal open to look around or something like that.  It was a bit disappointing to just see from the gates."
6109,Date of experience: January 2020,10-Jan-20,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Lots of history in a beautiful setting,"Rose Bowl Stadium is quite unique. The stadium has no concourses all the vendors and facilities are outside of the stadium. When you enter the stadium you walk right into the seating bowl. We were seated on the West side so had shade in the afternoon and did not have to deal with the sun in our eyes. Sunset was amazing, some of the famed LA/Pasadena haze made it even more spectacular. If you get a chance go. All seats on the sides have backs and arm rests. Seats in the end zones are traditional bleachers."

Even though our Badgers lost, the weather, the atmosphere, and the entire Rose Bowl scene resulted in a lifetime of memories!"
6111,Date of experience: January 2020,4-Jan-20,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Best stadium for college football in the country,The Rose Bowl is the best college football game every season whether your team is playing in the game or not.  It truly is the ??Granddaddy of them all?? (in the words of the great Keith Jackson).  There literally is not a bad seat in the stadium.  There is nothing like the sunset late in the 3rd quarter as the sun sets and lights up the San Gabriel Mountains.  The pageantry and tradition of the Rose Bowl game is unmatched in college football.  And when your team plays in and wins the Rose Bowl it is literally a dream come true.  Go Ducks!
6112,Date of experience: January 2020,1-Jan-20,Big Ten,UCLA,1,Don't go if you need a seatback,"This was my 2nd time to the Rose Bowl. I found out the 1st time that the seats don't have backs. I have back problems so this time I brought a stadium seat. They wouldn't allow me to bring it in. As I was going to my seat I saw someone with a stadium seat identcal to mine. They said no one even mentioned it, they had no issues bringing it in. This was my last time at this stadium."
6113,Date of experience: October 2019,12-Nov-19,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Great Stadium!,I have been to this stadium many times and the experience was always great. Parking is easy but pricey and the area around the stadium are beautiful. The stadium inside is really big and you don't feel all the crowd in there. There is plenty of space for everyone.The only downside is that the stadium is not covered but you don't need any cover in California since it never rains here.
6114,Date of experience: October 2019,8-Nov-19,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Great to experience world-class stadium,"A marvellous sporting ground, it was completed in 1922 and hosts the annual Rose Bowl Game. Expanded since its inauguration it now has a seating capacity of over 90,000 spectators.It is the home ground for the UCLA football team."
6115,Date of experience: November 2019,6-Nov-19,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Nice Place for a Run,The Rose Bowl in Pasadena is a great place to go for a run. I go there often to run the three mile loop. I like that the loop around the Rose Bowl is three miles and perfect for training for a race. Surrounding the Rose Bowl is the famous stadium and a golf course. The loop goes around both. I would recommend the Rose Bowl for anyone looking for a place to run or walk.
6116,Date of experience: October 2019,13-Oct-19,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Fun at the Flea Market,"This is my first time to visit the flea market and I am glad I did There are a lot of interesting items to purchase for home and for gifts The prices and variety are great I plan to return next month in preparation for holiday gift giving If you plan to go - make sure you bring a hat, sunscreen and wear tennis shoes. Prepare for lots of walking.Also - there is not a lot of options for vegans so make sure to pack a snack or eat before coming"
6117,Date of experience: September 2019,18-Sep-19,Big Ten,UCLA,5,UCLA game at the infamous Rose Bowl,"You??ve grown up watching the games played here, now come experience it! We watched UCLA play in their home stadium and experienced the grandeur of the views, so many seats are great! We visited with a former Bruin Linebacker (my future son in law) so we??re able to go on the field before the game. The turf was in great shape and it was an awe inspiring experience to look up into the crowds ready for the game. The food vendors were kind and the offerings were tasty and well priced. It??s an old stadium so the seats are a bit tight and there??s not much leg room if you are a tall person, but it??s worth the experience to attend. Of course the 50 yard line seats were fantastic. Bring sunscreen it gets hot on the sunny side of the field."
6118,Date of experience: September 2019,17-Sep-19,Big Ten,UCLA,1,The worst sporting event I have ever been to OU vs UCLA. Poor facilities management,"To whomever would care who manages the facilities at the Rose Bowl you should be ashamed. I was at the UCLA game 9/14/2019. As someone who paid money to go to this game and the respect that I as well as the fans that attended spending $100s or not $1000 to go were given is a travesty. We had to wait in line as only 3 gates were opened, i did not get to my seat until the end of the 1st quarter!! How is that even possible. You charge the highest prices have the worst facilities and that is the best you can do. What a shame, it is no wonder why the game is so poorly attended.  Sure I wont be getting a refund or even a 'so sorry' you obviously dont care. Dont believe what you hear people thinking the Grand Daddy of them all is iconic.. well it once was whoever is running the show right now, should be FIRED!!!"
6123,Date of experience: August 2019,28-Aug-19,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Rolling Stones were great,"Great show,but the Rose Bowl was not great. No one could give us any information as they were just hired for the event. Seating was haphazard and uncomfortable and we were directed to wrong seats (by staff)for over an hour and had to move.Worst venue ever for the Rolling Stones,but their show was great!"
6127,Date of experience: August 2019,24-Aug-19,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Rolling Stones,"There are many ways to arrive at the Rose Bowl. Many people take a shuttle from the Parsons lot and others take Uber or a Lyft.After much thought we decided to go to the show 3 hours before showtime and found a place to park easily and once the show was over we bolted to our car and we??re out in 20 minutes back to our hotel.With this many people, 60 to 80,000 people, I would highly NOT suggest that you take a Lyft or Uber. We did this at the Paul McCartney show at Dodger Stadium and it took us over 2 hours to get a ride. I will never do that again unless I am at a small venue. There were many people who simply walked from the old town Pasadena areaThere was a very large staff of security however each person seemed to be from a different unit or department. There was clearly no additional preparation for an older crowd to see the Rolling Stones. We are in our 50s and did not have an issue however there were many many people who were having issues standing in the hot sun and not getting any assistance from their car to the entrance or from the entrance to their seat. One could argue that if you were not able to assist yourself then you shouldn??t go but that doesn??t seem to be the theme most places. AlI I could say is that if I had trouble walking and knew the crowd was going to be huge, I would personally probably opt out of even attending the event. Rose Bowl would argue that there was a separate ADA Entrance however it was in the sun with no separate seating for sun protection and it was really nothing more than a separate line. This scenario was clearly inadequate and I felt sorry for the people that needed help because the Rose Bowl was grossly unprepared. There was a guy behind us in line who complained to several security people that walked by while we were waiting to get into the Rose Bowl and none of them really seemed to have an answer or any empathy.aWe did see one person have a medical problem while standing in line to get into the event and it seemed to be chaos with at least four different types of uniforms and an ambulance drove right by even though there were 3 dozen people screaming and yelling ??over here??!I would strongly suggest that you arrive early for any event. Since we arrived early it was very easy to wander around and the bathrooms were good for the both men and women and there was plenty of places for food and drink. As it got closer to showtime everything was extremely crowded.Although there is a ridiculous gun problem in this country the bag policy for the Rose Bowl was the tightest security of any event I have ever been to and I have been to hundreds of events. It was more extreme than flying and getting through TSA security. You absolutely need to pay attention to the bag policy because if you do not it will make your day miserable!! My wife ended up taking a very small cell phone case which she could put her ID, insurance card and some cash and that was all. I took nothing in except what fit in my shorts pockets: wallet, phone and glasses.The place itself is very old and the seats are extremely tight. I took a couple of photos that you can see below. I am 5??11?? and my wife is 5??6?? and you can see that we were extremely tight sitting in the seats. If you are a large person you will most likely be very uncomfortable in the seats.So now the question remains,  would I go again: if there was an event that I absolutely had to see I would go early and pay very close attention to all the announcements that come on email, Facebook and Instagram prior to arriving at the event. Unfortunately for older folks it seems as though you??re forced to follow your team or event on social media to get the most information directly from the promoters. Other than that I think the place is too large and too outdated and would much rather see a game or a show in a more modern place like the Forum or the new stadium that is being the built right next to the Forum.Of course the Rolling Stones show itself was amazing and awesome so I put up with everything that I mentioned above but you should be aware of all the details if you choose to go to the Rose Bowl."
6128,Date of experience: August 2019,18-Aug-19,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Best Flea Market EVER!,If you love flea markets then this is the place for you if you??re in the Pasadena area!!!!  I mean they have everything! It??s a massive display of all things u Kauwait and wonderful.

6142,Date of experience: September 2018,24-Mar-19,Big Ten,UCLA,5,This is one of Pasadena's most famous attractions,"While I am in my mid-seventies, I didn't step into the Rose Bowl until I was about 23. I knew the Rose Bowl as the site of the Biggest and Best New Years' college football games only. I didn't follow football so all I knew really was that the Rose Bowl game on New Years' Day with everyone I knew in Los Angeles.Then I went to a Pasadena High School graduation held at the Rose Bowl. Three different high schools were graduating an outstanding group of students and we were there in person. I was so impressed by the size and quality of the stadium. It was exciting to be there after growing up seeing it on TV.Then my husband and I bought our first house and we started going to the Swap Meets held there every month. I had never seen so many antiques in one place and the crowd walking the aisles was friendly and everyone seemed so happy to be out in the sun finding bargains galore. Soon my husband wanted to have a booth of our own to see his hand made and carved leather products. At first we had not realized that we needed to be in line as sellers at 4 or 4:30 AM. That was rough but being there, treating the facility as our own, or at least about 100 sq. ft. of it, was a thrill. It was fun to talk to the buyers.Now as I look back for the purpose of the review I can see why the Rose Bowl is so precious to the families of Pasadena. Actually, the Rose Bowl itself has become the central piece of a very large recreation center for Los Angeles. Now it is at the heart of the area where walkers and hikers enjoy the trails and where dogs enjoy a dog park and where one of the best park grounds offers barbecue facilities and where there is a fine aquatic center. The list goes on and on."
6145,Date of experience: December 2018,5-Feb-19,Big Ten,UCLA,1,Rv parking at Rose Bowl,"I called and emailed Park Jockey to find out the exact requirements for parking our fith wheel trailer for two nights.  Park Jockey emailed back saying a truck and trailer are concidered as one unit and I did not have to pay for a tow vehicle. This is in an email from Park Jockey.   The day I arrived I was told I had to pay an extra $40 or leave with no refund, so I paid even after explaining everything to the attendant and showing him the Email.  So figured I would get it resolved after I got home.  That's not going to happen, Park Jockey said they charged me correctly and that's the end of it.  If you plan to RV for the Rose bowl with a trailer plan on paying the max amount that's is shown on the web site. If you don't they will get it from you one way or the other."

Longer times getting out, you may park on the grass, and tons of people. We go to the flea market and TONS of stuff to look at. Some vendors ask for high prices on cheap items, be smart and negotiate or walk away. Someone has it for a reasonable price. Food vendors and bathrooms all around. Enjoyable if shopping or not."
6148,Date of experience: January 2019,15-Jan-19,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Great Vintage stadium...But also vintage Food Vendors...How To attend the Rose Bowl on a scalped Ticket,"I attended the 2019 Rose Bowl Game, Ohio St. Vs Washington. I didn't have a team in the fight, I just went as a fan of great sporting events. I went to the parade and left at 10:30 and walked from Pasadena City College to the free shuttle line at the start of the parade route (North Pasadena Ave and West Union Street). The guy there told me the line was AT LEAST 45min..It was LOOOOONG and the first of many lines encountered...It was less than 2 miles from there to the stadium so since I had no ticket I hoofed it. The walk was fine but there were not any ticket sellers for the first 1.5 miles....There were maybe 2 homeless looking guys with ""Need A Ticket"" signs...My guess is they were working for someone to acquire low bid tickets to resell...I was checking Stub Hub and at around noon the ticket prices were $130-150 for anything endzone and decent. There were $90-110 tickets available but they were all row 70+ ...a reasonable ""Safe"" get in price but not ideal. There are also the stub hub fees and taxes that make the $90 ticket about $125+ and the stub hub last minute pick up is about a mile due east of the stadium so it's a 2 mile round trip to get the ticket.Once the stadium was visible in the distance I started to notice sellers mulling about...I guess the police don't really care and there were at least 5 guys I passed on my way into the parking lot selling tickets. I found one guy who had about 14 tickets in hand, all grouped in sets of 2 or 4 tickets. I only needed one so he showed me his groups of 4 which would still leave him with 3. One that caught my eye was Tunnel 1 Row 55 seat 121. The face price was $215. I was of course wary of counterfeits as well...So I pulled out my phone and read the barcode with an app that reads barcodes (for scanning shopping cards etc) and the number matched the barcode. The seller was all ""What are you doing?"" I told him I was verifying the barcode. If it's good we have a sale. He said ""We don't rip people off here"" ...I told him I'm from Boston and they do it there so I'm just being careful....I know a guy who bought NCAA tickets for basketball playoffs..He got to the venue and they were like ""Umm..fake..."" He was out over $500..They looked legit when he showed me later but when I scanned the barcode for him it read 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-0-1 even thought he ticket number was some random numbers that looked real...They were fake...Lesson learned.Ticket scanned ok on my app...I offered him a fresh $100 and he was good with that. So for $100 I was in Tunnel 1 with a seatback, 55 rows from the field and I was pretty sure he wouldn't be able to sell the last 3 so I had a good chance of 3 empty seats next to me. I snuck a quick picture of the seller just in case and then ticket in hand headed for the gate...When I was entering and the woman scanned it I said aloud ""Please be real...."" she laughed and said ""You're good, we've had a few of those prayers today"".....I was in...$100....great deal and a great first Rose Bowl..even though I would have appreciated a closer game.?Notes...There are not nearly enough food vendors at the Rose Bowl stadium. The lines for regular food were 45 minutes with 4 minutes left in the first half. Once half-time started I was dumbfounded at the inability to get any food without waiting an hour+. There seemed to be no ""Hey hotdog here"" vendors in the stands. I went up to a guy selling pretzels from his vendor bag on the concourse and asked if there was any way to get hot food without waiting in line for an hour...he said ""Tre has some hot dogs....YO TRE, WHERE YOU AT?"" and Tre raised his hand in the crowd from 50 feet away... I went to Tre and sure enough he had about a dozen foil wrapped hot dogs squirreled away in his vendor bag below the hot pretzels...I gave him $10 for a hot dog and told him to keep it. It was worth my time saved...I was going to take 2 but i realized that as soon as he handed me a hot dog a dozen people caught on and all offered him $$ for hot dogs...So I only bough 1...I understood the need for food...They simply have the worst food service model ever. It's woefully unprepared to serve 100,000 people. You cannot get anything to eat in a timely manner from 1 hour before kickoff until you find a restaurant on your way home...Alcohol is everywhere and there are no lines/short lines. It was $14 for a 24oz coors light can and $17 for a 24oz 805 can and the same for a 24oz Modelo...there might have been a I'm pretty sure those were the only beers they offer in the area of the stadium I was in. It would be a hard walk through the crowds to the next area to find alternatives. There was ONLY coors Draft. It was billed as ""Stadium Draft Beer $12"". No other beers...It's pretty much just Coors Light.... They also had pre-mix drinks in little 6 oz? Bottles for $15 that were Jalepeno margarita, cosmos and vodka somethings...They would pour that in a cup of Ice for you...Get a seat with a seat back if possible. It's roomier and more comfortable. Check out the sections before hand but it's basically any seats on the sidelines from end zone to end zone...BRING SUNSCREEN! I had a little travel bottle that I shared with at least 8 other people who were cooking in the sun.Look for security gates further down if the one you are entering in is packed. Gates B and C were packed and a guy said ""Walk to Gate D it's empty"" and sure enough there was nobody there...In in 5 min.There are a lot of porta potties all over the place when you are walking to the stadium and in the parking lot...I ended up walking over 7 miles in and out that day...good exercise."
6149,Date of experience: January 2019,14-Jan-19,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Best setting in America for football!,My family of four recently attended our third Rose Bowl game and needless to say we highly recommend the experience.  The setting is absolutely beautiful and something that TV does not do justice.  The staff at the stadium is very helpful and courteous. Parking is tricky but if you arrive early and park on the golf course you will be fine - we even walked up to the parade and back with ease.  Highly recommend this game and stadium for football fans everywhere!
6150,Date of experience: January 2019,10-Jan-19,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Rose bowl game,"Went to the game between the Huskies and the Buckeyes.We had been to the parade in the morning and walked to the stadium after the parade.We noticed when walking into the stadium that there was room for very few cars in the area. We had no idea about the parking or how to leave the stadium and were very lucky to have gotten ahold of some others on our tour for the parade during the game or we may still be there. We got into the line for the buses to take us to Pasadena. Little did we know that the line went throughout the area for about a mile ending up in cattle pens before boarding the buses. The buses moved a ton of people back to Pasadena but it took us well over an hour to get on a bus. The stadium setting was beautiful and every seat seemed to have an unobstructed view. The seating was exactly what you would expect for an outdoor stadium and the design with the tunnels entering about half way up the seating area was great. The bathrooms on the concourse were numerous. With 91,000 people you should expect a wait.Although the game itself was rather boring until the last five minutes, I crossed this off the list. Probably would not return just because of the parking."
6151,Date of experience: January 2019,6-Jan-19,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Rose bowl game,Went for the Rose Bowl game and it was an epic experience. Full house for a great game. Stealth fly over was awesome as well as fireworks and confetti at the end.  The stadium staff is extremely friendly and makes the experience even better.
6152,Date of experience: January 2019,6-Jan-19,Big Ten,UCLA,1,Plan well ahead,"Took my wife, three sons and one daughter to watch Ohio State play Washington in the 2019 Rose Bowl. Parking was not bad, already had a parking ticket in general parking which is located on the golf course. We were one mile from the stadium so decided to start early heading there so to watch the band prior to kickoff. The one mile walk turned into 1.5 miles based on all the obstacles we had to manage. One was a six foot opening on the golf course that 10,000 people were trying to get through, added 20 minutes. We then arrived at our gate of entry where we found ourselves in a cattle type shoot funneling the same 10,000 people through five security check points, one at a time. Don??t get me wrong, I encourage security but it took one hour from that point to clear security. It??s not like they have this game every ten years. We finally arrived at our seat with the game just starting. I had heard how bad the bathrooms or lack there of were, it was all true, another 30 minute wait. It??s very sad that a venue like this with so many events each year can figure it out. I??ll watch from home next time."
6153,Date of experience: January 2019,5-Jan-19,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Once in a (my) lifetime trip to the Rose bowl,The city really knows how to host a bowl game! From the parade to the local restaurants everyone was welcoming! Very impressed that they could host this huge event and still be so laid back and polite. If I had one concern do not take the shuttle back to the Parsons lot after the game. The line was unorganized and took much longer then the walk up the hill would have. We took the Metro out of town after the game which I would recommend.
6154,Date of experience: January 2019,4-Jan-19,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Rose Bowl Game,This was a once in a lifetime experience.  To experience the magic of the stadium and see our college football team play was memorable.  I will say that access to food and restrooms was poor at best.  I??m guessing that when this stadium was designed over 100 years ago there was not the knowledge that we have today on ease of access by good design.  Food lines easily interfered with foot traffic which greatly hindered both.  I would visit the stadium for special events but would not be interested in more frequent attendance.
6155,Date of experience: December 2018,4-Jan-19,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Great Experience First Rose Bowl,"I??ve read other reviews but we had such a great experience. We researched everything before coming, including reading the reviews, which helped us plan how to get the most out of our day in the easiest way possible. We were traveling with family, one who had a stroke and walked with a cane, so we wanted to make it as easy as possible for him to get around. This did cost us more money but we felt necessary. We paid extra to park in a closer lot, we arrived early and got to enjoy the area and get pictures easily without thousands of people around. We enjoyed the fan area and seeing everything going on. We got to our seats early and enjoyed watching warm ups, seeing coaches come out, etc.  Our seats were further up but we had a great view. I don??t have the best eyesight but I saw the entire field and scoreboards clearly. Any problems we had were other patrons acting like jerks, which isn??t the responsibility of the park.  I was amazed by people complaining about coming to an event with 91,000+ other people and thinking they are going to show up and walk in.  The bathroom situation. Again, there were more bathrooms than I normally see and any line I was in moved quickly. We really enjoyed ourselves. We didn??t rush to leave and watched the after game festivities. It was a little crowded still walking out so we expected trouble getting out of the parking lot and thought we may have to sit for a long time, but we moved right out and rarely stopped moving. We were back to our hotel long before we even thought we would be out of the parking lot.  Great game, great venue, lots of fun."
6156,Date of experience: January 2019,3-Jan-19,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Not an easy stadium to enter or exit,Went for the Rosebowl. The shuttle lines were crazy long so walked to the stadium. ( nice seeing the houses in the area) Once in the stadium the bench seat sections were super cramped . Also very hard to exit the seating section if anyone is trying to climb up the stairs.
6157,Date of experience: January 2019,3-Jan-19,Big Ten,UCLA,2,"I get the history of it all, but please update this stadium!","After attending the Rose Bowl 2019, I can say...I went to the Rose Bowl.  If I had to go there for any other event, I'd think twice about it.  It's old, dirty, ill-equipped.  Please spend some of that money you are making on parking, drinks and food and put it back into the stadium.  Not enough bathrooms, seats are so old, they are rusting apart.  Scoreboards and the like are severely lacking. Parking is a nightmare and worse getting out.  Cell service is out of the question during/after an event.  Forget about Uber, you'll never get a signal."
6158,Date of experience: January 2019,3-Jan-19,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Great Experience...Not Very Easy or Fan-Friendly,"We attended the game on Jan 1, 2019 and getting in and out of the Rose Bowl was a nightmare.  On the way into the game the lines were VERY long and security had no control of the crowds...people were pushing over the bike racks which made for a HUGE safety hazard and very chaotic atmosphere.  Plan to get into the game when gates open or wait in line for an hour plus.  Leaving the stadium is not any easier, we ended up walking back to Old Pasadena (2 miles) and grabbing an Uber from there.  Once in the stadium the experience is as beautiful as it looks on TV, but plan on a lot of time and walking getting into and leaving the game."
6159,Date of experience: January 2019,1-Jan-19,Big Ten,UCLA,5,105th Rose Bowl Ohio State vs. Washington,We went to watch the Rose Bowl for the First time in our lives. So cool. this historical Stadium in Pasadena. great atmosphere. The mother of all Collage Bowl Game. A must See.
6160,Date of experience: October 2018,9-Dec-18,Big Ten,UCLA,2,An Old Dump,"Look I have no choice in going to this old dump to see UCLA football, but this ""iconic"" venue is a dump. Lines are long to use restrooms, even after expanding them. The scoreboard is hard to read, especially on the South side. The replay screen is too small and unless you pay extra, you have to walk up narrow aisles with no railing to your seat. If you want to visit it because it is the Rose Bowl, go. But to see a football game it stinks. Did I mention, that unlike newer stadiums, the seats are way away from the field."
6162,Date of experience: November 2018,11-Nov-18,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Granddaddy of them all,"Best venue to see a game. Granddaddy of them all. With the San Gabriel mountains in the backdrop, what a beautiful scene to behold. Don't miss an opportunity to visit this beautiful venue."
6163,Date of experience: October 2018,2-Nov-18,Big Ten,UCLA,5,UCLA vs Arizona game,"Read the reviews and we arrived early and we were aware of the bag policy and we went into the stadium  early so no issues with long lines.Enjoyed the venue and game.  Sat up high enough so the we could see very well. We did lots of research before buying our tickets Since we read about all the parking and Uber issues we walked from the Courtyard in Old Town.  It was an easy and pleasant walk and we felt safe the whole time.The stadium staff was so helpful and there were student was signs asking on saying ""ask me if you need help"".  Given some of the bad reviews, we were prepared and it was so cool to this this iconic stadium in person.  We had pizza and found the rest rooms fine.  Does get cool so we were glad to have brought light jackets as it was a 7:30 game.  Would love to return some day and see the Grand Daddy of them all."
6165,Date of experience: October 2018,27-Oct-18,Big Ten,UCLA,4,ROSE BOWL GREAT VENUE AWFUL CHURROS,"Attended the Utah vs UCLA football games last night, and the Rose Bowl staff were all very friendly and helpful.  The Rose Bowl is a great venue.  Very clean, great seating, and lots of food choices.  However, the inner thing I would absolutely say to avoid, especially at $6 each is their churros.  They make the nastiest churros I have ever attempted to eat and just couldn't.  My husband couldn't stomach his, and there were people in row behind us who had purchased and they also couldn't eat.  In fact, over if the gentlemen said he had purchased one the last time Utah played 2 years ago, and said they were horrible then too.  He was really surprised that they were still as bad, but they were.  All of us three away.  So, great staff, great venue, but stay away from the churros."
6170,Date of experience: September 2018,18-Sep-18,Big Ten,UCLA,3,History dragged down by difficulty in getting to and from,"I did attend a Rose Bowl Gabe here many years ago- parked far away and walked inFrom more recent reviews, parking beside being a rip off is still nightmarishCome on- figure this out to make it slightly more pleasantly"
6173,Date of experience: September 2018,3-Sep-18,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Classic Stadium,"Needless to say that every trip to the Rose Bowl is a fun experience!  Weather it??s a UCLA home game, a World Cup Soccer game or the annual Rose Bowl Game, you are gonna have a good time at an old traditional, historic stadium!Every seat is a good seat!  The trick is to score a ticket at it??s sold out events! If you don??t want to play the parking lot game, just park near Old Town Pasadena and take the convenient shuttle in!  Such a time saving convenience!They have plenty of different food concessions. The restrooms are clean and the crowds are well behaved. Arrive early and enjoy your experience at ??The Granddaddy of Bowls??!  I??ve been doing this for decades!"

6176,Date of experience: November 2017,24-Aug-18,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Junkers Delight,"A trip to the Rose Bowl Swap meet is American Pickers on steroids. Come early, bring lots of cash and your bargaining skills. For well over 30 years this has been the monthly place to find that treasure you have been looking for but didn't know it. Bring lots of sunscreen and enjoy. More? you want more? in addition to the old stuff there is also an area for new things, clothes, furniture, plants, etc."
6180,Date of experience: August 2018,20-Aug-18,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Disappointed,"My first time here in this stadium and I was disappointed . Paid $60 dollars for preferred parking which was over priced .  Seats were uncomfortable . Legs were cramped due to lack of leg room, shoulder to shoulder on sides. No air flow so it was very hot . Took over an hour to get out of the parking lot, no traffic directors until the end."
6186,Date of experience: August 2018,17-Aug-18,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Great Experience,Highly recommend going to this iconic stadium.  Watched OU and Georgia.  What a great experience and loved.....every minute of it.
6190,Date of experience: January 2018,6-Aug-18,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Rose Bowl Game - GA vs OK,"First visit to the historic Rose Bowl.  The venue exceeded out expectations.  We sat on the Georgia side on 50 yard line, halfway up and had the most perfect birds eye view of the entire game."
6195,Date of experience: September 2017,12-Jul-18,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Brilliant Show!,"Everything about this stadium is brilliant. Things were sign posted perfectly. I saw GreenDay here last year and the staff were very friendly, always helpful and as I was catching an Uber after the show, signs were clearly marked as to where you had to go for pick up/drop off. It was an awesome night and everyone there made it feel a lot safer. Security was brilliant and well taken care of. I felt very safe."
6202,Date of experience: January 2018,28-May-18,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Gooooo Dawgs....what a game,First of all the surrounding area including the neighborhoods and Pasadena were wonderful.  Second of all the game was incredible.  It was the absolute best game I have ever attended.  The atmosphere was great.  The weather was perfect.  The fans were in to the game all the way thru 2 overtimes.   The only negative experience was once inside getting around the stadium.  We were stuck in a sea of people for 30 minutes and did not move a foot.  Some people were frightened and others just frustrated.  The area where the concessions are located needs to be widened.
6203,Date of experience: December 2017,20-May-18,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Gooo Dawgs!,"What an amazing experience to not only be able to go to The Granddaddy of them all, but watch my husbands face when the Bulldogs won! This place has a presence that??s hard to explain...you just have to experience it."
6208,Date of experience: January 2018,13-Apr-18,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Almost 4 months later,"So its been 4 months since Georgia won the Rose Bowl and I am still in disbelief that we were able to be there and win the game as we did.  Unbelievable.As for the stadium and getting in and out of it the city of Pasadena seriously needs to get better at hosting this event.  They are going to get a bunch of people hurt or worse having them stand around in a crowd for 3 hours after an event. In this day and age and the iconic stature of this event you would think it would be a matter of national security.  Instead it is about as important to the City of Pasadena as a leaf falling in the street in October.  The event planners should do everything possible to disperse as much of the crowd as possible as soon as possible after such an event.  Instead they have people lined up for 3 hours, often in zig-zagged lines where there are thousands of people within and area 50 yards square....and not a security person in sight!  There are event volunteers but these are high school and college aged kids without a clue of what they are doing and, after the game, ready to go home and be done with the whole thing!Security is so bad that about an hour after the game vendors start showing up and start cooking with propane cylinders in huge crowds of people standing nearby.  Let that sink in for a minute and consider some of the attacks on crowds the world has seen in the last few years.  I am not  going to live life being afraid and refusing to go to events like the Rose Bowl....but I am also not blind to what is a catastrophe waiting to happen. The Rose Bowl, the City of Pasadena and the State of California really need to get this under control before there is an incident that gets a bunch of people hurt."
6209,Date of experience: January 2018,12-Apr-18,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Best College Football Venue,We are huge Oklahoma Sooner fans so we made the trip to Pasadena for this year??s Rose Bowl. The game didn??t end the way we hoped but it didn??t take away from the experience. We started our day at the Rose Bowl Parade then went to the game. I??d heard great things about it but the event definitely lived up to the hype!!Don??t miss the opportunity to attend a game at this stadium. Boomer Sooner!
6210,Date of experience: January 2018,2-Apr-18,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Iconic college football venue,"If you have a chance to go to a Rose Bowl Game, you should do it! I've been fortunate enough to go twice, and the atmosphere and pageantry are like nothing else in college football. In both cases, the weather was spectacular and the sky provided some memorable sunsets. Be prepared to do some walking -- maybe a lot of walking -- from the parking lot, and know that the stadium is old and lacks modern amenities. However, going to a Rose Bowl is something you won't forget. You can (should) prepay for parking in advance on the web site; ride share is not available for pick-up close to the stadium.In 2018, we happened to be blessed to witness one of the greatest college football games ever, between the University of Georgia and the University of Oklahoma. It was the first overtime game in Rose Bowl history, and totally lived up to the hype!"
6212,Date of experience: January 2018,18-Mar-18,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Rose Bowl Game 2018,"My daughter is an Alumni of the University of Georgia so we went to the game. Prepare to do some walking, like any major sporting event! They do it right at this stadium. That's probably because it's the oldest bowl game, called, ""the Grandaddy of Them All."" The weather is great at that time of year and I took some beautiful pictures. If good pictures are what you're after, sit on the east side of the stadium. Mother Nature will bless you with a sight at sunset that will be the treasure of your pictures! When you enter the stadium, you will see the teams that have played here, it dawns on you that you have entered a revered place sculpted from college football history. Hopefully your team wins, but with the experience, there can be no losers! Also, the workers are friendly and courteous to help extend this wonderful experience!"
6213,Date of experience: January 2018,5-Mar-18,Big Ten,UCLA,5,2018 Rosebowl,"Bucket list trip. It didn't disappoint. We are Oklahoma Sooner fans and even though the game didn't come out the way we had hoped, it was still a trip of a lifetime."
6214,Date of experience: January 2018,4-Mar-18,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Trip of a lifetime!,"We really enjoyed our trip to watch UGA play in the Rose Bowl. The stadium is older, but it is beautiful with a nice view of the mountains in the background. The weather could not have been more perfect. Everyone we met there from security to concession stand vendors were super nice! Great experience. If you ever have the opportunity to go watch your team play in The Rose Bowl on New Year??s Day, do it!"
6217,Date of experience: January 2018,5-Feb-18,Big Ten,UCLA,5,"Like all ""Granddaddies"", you must this Granddaddy of College Football!","We were fortunate to travel and watch our beloved Bulldogs at the Rose Bowl Game.  The stadium grounds are beautiful . . . When traveling there for a game, go a day early just to stroll around.  Also, there's an economically priced public golf course immediately behind the stadium - a must for any college football & golf lover!"
6218,Date of experience: January 2018,29-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Always wanted to visit,Planning on heading Black next year for the parade and game. If you are a football fan this is an iconic stadium
6219,Date of experience: August 2017,28-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Classic game venue,This was a bucket list trip for a college football game. The Rose Bowl is a must for every serious fan. Parking and access were fairly easy. Food was even decent for a football game. Take some extra time to walk the tailgating scene and soak in the experience.
6220,Date of experience: December 2017,22-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Bike around the Rose Bowl,On Dec 31 we wanted to check out Pasadena and the rose  Bowl.  Free parking is available near the Rose Bowl. We rode our bikes For 3 miles around the Rose Bowl stopping to watch as university band members were arriving for photo shoot.
6221,Date of experience: January 2018,21-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,5,2018 Rose Bowl -CFB playoff,"There is no other college football bowl I would travel to, but jumped at the chance to see my Georgia Bulldawgs play in this year's Rose Bowl.  The experience was everything I hoped for.  This iconic venue was even better than expected amenity-wise.  I anticipated hellishly long bathroom lines and limited food offerings due to the stadium's age.  This wasn't the case at all.  Lines moved swiftly.  This venue, built in 1921, did a MUCH better job of handling the crowd of 90k+, than the brand new Mercedes Benz Stadium in Atlanta did the following week with a crows of 75k."
6222,Date of experience: January 2018,20-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Go Dawgs- Rose Bowl,"As other reviews have stated,it's an older stadium so don't be surprised at the size of the screen.Get your food before you go to your seats. It's different than other stadiums and food is actually outside the tunnel to seats. Restrooms too."
6223,Date of experience: January 2018,19-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,4,"Rose Bowl, historic and fun.",We recently attended college playoffs at the Rose Bowl. So fun to see and attend a game here. We had end zone seats but we could see great. We had a great experience cheering on our GA Bulldogs! My one issue was the super slow service at the concession stand. (This May be run by another company so not Rose Bowl fault but it needs improvement!) Parking was easy and well staffed and organized. Sitting in this famous stadium was an outstanding experience. I??d love to attend the flea market there. Overall great experience and fun to see this historic stadium!
6224,Date of experience: January 2018,17-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Georgia Bulldogs in the 2018 Rose Bowl!,I love this stadium.  It is so iconic and historical.  It was an honor to be there cheering on the Dawgs for the playoffs!
6225,Date of experience: January 2018,15-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Great Game Horrendous Lack of Organization,"My husband and I were fortunate enough to attend the Tournament of Roses Parade this year as well as the Rose Bowl.  What a game!  Staying in Pasadena, we had short walk to the Gold Line at Allen Station to Parson's parking lot where we caught the shuttle to the stadium.  Entering the stadium was crowded but didn't take us very long to make our way through the tunnel.  Our seats were good and we had a good view with the help of the large screen.  Exiting the stadium was a total nightmare.  There was no organization as to dividing shuttle riders and folks who had driven and parked.  It took us more than 4 hours from the time was over to be herded with the masses to a line about 1 1/2 miles long to queue to the shuttles and make our way back to our hotel.  Total pandemonium!  We thoroughly enjoyed seeing the stadium, experiencing the amazing game, but if you go, be prepared and store up on lots of patience and tolerance knowing that the exit process will be complete bedlam!"
6226,Date of experience: January 2018,15-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,5,UGA Rose Bowl 2018,Best game I??ve ever witnessed in one of the best football atmospheres!!!!

6228,Date of experience: January 2018,13-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Historic stadium!!,Came for the Rose Bowl game. Had heard mixed things about the stadium. Parked on a golf course. Location marked by lit balloons.The tunnels in were packed. However the seats were good. We were up high where there was a concourse with bathrooms and food.No need to go back through tunnels.A great experience. Go Dawgs!!
6229,Date of experience: January 2018,12-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,4,The stadium has seen better days and needs some serious TLC as well as some organization.....,"(it gets the benefit of the doubt b/c of its history hence four instead of three points).  The good points are: it is ""The Rose Bowl""--a historic venue in a gorgeous setting.  Due to the bowl shape of the stadium you can see most of what happens on the field.  Well that is about it for the good.......Getting to the place is a nightmare of epic proportions.  Its location in a residential area means traffic--two hours before the game--is at a standstill and those directing traffic (as I discovered pretty much around LA in general) have no clue what they are doing.  Parking is easy--if you do not mind walking a mile, plus.  The official parking is on an adjacent golf course but getting to/from one's car can take a while as some of the parking is as far as a mile fr/ the stadium and you had better remember exactly where you parked as, except for balloons showing the parking area number--there are few, if any landmarks.  Once you have actually gotten TO the bowl it is an even worse nightmare getting into the stadium and the hired help is a total joke (when is anyone going to realize that the ""S"" in CSC event staff stands for either ""surly"" or ""stupid"").  Once in line to get into the stadium it took almost an hour and that was after spending half an hour finding where to get into line due to the lunacy of their queue configuration.  The people in charge of security are an absolute joke and simply want to show they have a modicum of authority so use it as often as possible.  Not only are they under-staffed but also under-trained, under-equipped, and just plain ignorant, surly, & downright mean.  As ushers inside the stadium they have no clue as I was accosted when I walked through the tunnel to get to my seat where a CSC staffer demanded to see my ticket and then proceeded to send me the wrong way to my seat.  When I noted that was the wrong way I was told that I should go the way instructed.   Upon trying to leave the exit we wanted to use was blocked and we were forced into a narrow gate only to get stuck behind a CSC event ""supervisor""---or so his cap said--who walked in front of us smoking and cursing into his cell phone.   As has been mentioned there are no rails to assist you in climbing the stairs and those stairs and seating is very tight so think before you decide to leave your seat.  Concession lines are extremely long and those concessions are vastly over-priced ($7 for ""luke-cold"" bottled water).  The only lines longer are for the vastly inadequate restroom facilities.  Note you cannot keep up w/ the game outside of the seating area b/c there are no television screens or public address announcements on the concourse area--at least none that I saw.  Luckily the game was in our favor; we visited a historic venue for a historic game; and we have a picture standing in front of the neon ""Rose Bowl"" sign.  My suggestion to the Rose Bowl folk is to hire a new staffing agency; make certain they are trained and friendly/polite (surprisingly those were about the only people in LA--aside fr/ drivers--who were not outgoingly friendly); update the concessions & restrooms and add some hand rails)"
6230,Date of experience: January 2018,11-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Beautiful Neon Sign,We did not attend the game we only stopped by to see what the stadium look like.  We did here it's crazy on New Year's Eve night. That's when the floats are done and people are celebrating. The Rose Bowl sign is beautiful to see at night.
6231,Date of experience: January 2018,8-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,5,"There's a reason it's called ""The Granddaddy of Them ALL""!!!   Amazing Experience!!","We had the Trip of a Lifetime when we attended the 2018 Rose Bowl!!  It was a super addition that our ""Glorious Dawgs""  came home with a win.  Yes, the Rose Bowl is old, but hey you knew that when you went people.  It's historic,  that means it's OLD!!  We drove to the stadium and didn't have any problems at all getting in or out.  Was it slow?  YES, but what do you expect when moving 90K people from one area?  Have some patience.  The stadium was awesome, I don't think there was a bad seat in the house.  I also never experienced any problems with lines at any of the restrooms either.  Food vendors were plentiful and there seemed to be a wide variety  as well."
6232,Date of experience: January 2018,7-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,4,An Experience,"Attended 2018 Rose Bowl for UGA against Oklahoma. It is an old stadium, but definitely worth the trip. Hard to get in and out of the stands, but really not a bad seat in the place. The concessions are definitely in need of up upgrading. Dogs winning helped make it an even better experience."
6233,Date of experience: January 2018,6-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,3,What a game,"We fulfilled a bucket list trip by attending the 2018 Tournament of Roses-many folks around us were doing the same.  It was a bonus that the Bulldogs were playing.  I was surprise to find the stadium in a residential area.  Except for tradition, the Rose Bowl is a very outdated stadium that is hard to maneuver.  Steps are very steep with no railings, the tunnels are very narrow, and the restrooms old.  Many food vendors and drink varieties, but the rows are so tight, not many people fought to get out of their seats.  But it was a glorious game!"
6234,Date of experience: January 2018,5-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Experience of a lifetime - but know before you go!,"Let me start by saying my trip to the Rose Bowl on 1/1/18 was the trip of a LIFETIME.  My team won in double O.T. (Go Dawgs!) and is headed to the National Championship game.  I would not trade this experience for anything!  If you get the chance ?? GO ?? but take some advice from people who have been there, done that.  There are some logistical details I wish I had known before I went.The ParadeStadium parking is 5+ miles from some sections of the Rose Parade.  Ideally, you would park your car where you plan to tailgate (ideally in a low-number lot like 1 or 2...) and take an Uber to the parade.  We walked several miles and then finally took an LA Metro (their subway) that morning to get to our grandstands (1570 Colorado).  I am so glad we saw the parade, but I won't need to do it again.  We left before it ended and basically ran to an Uber to get out of there before the crowds.  People that left very soon after us took over an hour to get back to the stadium parking/tailgating area.  With time being short (8 AM parade and 2 PM kickoff) that cut way into tailgating time.  Sit at the start of the parade (the end of the route closest to Rose Bowl Stadium) and once it's about 70% over -- get out of there (if you care at all about getting back to your tailgate!).  Clearly I like tailgating!Back to the tailgating...Some of the lots are REALLY FAR (mile+) from the stadium.  Lots 6, 7, etc. are a good hike so don't plan to park in 7 and carry your stuff to someone's set up in lot 2... unless you have a large wheeled cart!If you have people trying to find you, take some sort of very obvious flag or balloon or similar object to fly really high in the sky.  It is almost impossible otherwise because there aren't a ton of landmarks once you get out onto the golf course (where the parking and tailgating occurs).   There is a company called Tailgate Concierge which we used in order to have everything set up for us (food, booze, TV, tent, chairs, etc.) since we came across the country and didn??t have all our stuff.  Worth looking into if you have a large enough group!Our kickoff was at 2 PM.  We headed in at 12:40 and barely made it.  There are 4 gates, each with only 7-8 security lines.  It takes FOREVER.  Once it finally started to move, it seemed ok, but we felt like corralled cows at one point ?? stuffed in the queues and not moving.  I have some claustrophobia but I did ok.  Mainly because you are outside (just look up at all that space above you!) and surrounded by mostly your own people.  If you go in without a bag AT ALL, you can go in the shorter lines.  I would have put my phone in one pocket, cash and ID in another, and my ticket on a lanyard around my neck had I known that.  But we made it in, and got to our seats - eventually.  The seating numbers do NOT make sense, no one who works there seems to know where seat numbers start and end, and they really aren??t much help.  Very nice, but not helpful!  We walked up and down to the top row about 4 times before we landed in our seats.  Try to scope out a map and figure out which row you will walk up or down ahead of time.  I wish we had!  Especially once people are sitting on the seat numbers and the sections aren??t labeled very well, it is tricky.  The TunnelsThe word ??tunnel?? freaks me out (see claustrophobia above!) but these are just openings into the stadium, like EVERY OTHER stadium I have ever been in, that lead you from concessions to inside the bowl shape and to the seats.  Tunnel is a misnomer.  We also had no trouble getting to our seats from the tunnels ?? it was the entry gates that caused the problem.  Tunnel 27 was more like an open air hallway and then 8-9 steps up to the seats where the ushers stand to (try to) guide you.  Concessions Maybe there aren??t enough concessions as others have said, but maybe it was just because this was the ROSE BOWL and no one cares about paying for a $14 beer after they have bought a ticket, a cross country flight, a hotel room, and paid whatever other expenses.  But the lines were long, and some moved faster than others.  Your best bets are the domestic beer lines where you get a 24 oz. bomber in a can (less spilling!) for $14.  Make some friends in the line and try to listen for cheers so you can keep up with the game.  I had been told ??if you go out for a beer you may miss a whole quarter?? and that is not true.  Perhaps before the renovations from 2013-2017, but not anymore.  You may miss a possession but not a quarter.  The pizza is good too!TIPS:- Most of the areas where you walk are dirt so don't wear new shoes.  - It is a LOT of walking - think Disney-amounts of walking.  I wish I had worn my running shoes despite them not being as cute!- It gets COLD when the sun goes down.  You are in the mountains."
6235,Date of experience: January 2018,5-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Rose Bowl 2018,"Great historical venue, small tunnels to enter and exit the game stadium.  Wonderful staff to make sure you are seated properly.  Take you ticket each time you exit the viewing area to visit concessions or restroom.  It would be a good idea to purchase a ticket lanyard.  Not enough food, ran out before end of game & limited tv's for viewing while waiting for food.  If you are traveling with a ADA person you will need to look for ADS entrance signs, not clearly visible."
6236,Date of experience: January 2018,4-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,2,An infrastructure nightmare.,"Typical of ""venerable"" stadiums, the Rose Bowl has terrible access. There is a good amount of parking available but, due to limited roadways, it is difficult to get to. The stadium is old and does not have such niceties as handrails. The seating is the worst aluminum bench seating I have ever had the misery to sit upon. The benches have two gaps in them to give you an especially painful sitting experience. The only good thing about the stadium is that, being a bowl, it does have good sight lines."
6237,Date of experience: January 2018,4-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,5,yes there are FLAWS but come on it's THE ROSE BOWL,"Here is the downside....parking can be horrific, it's crowded, the stadium is old and antiquated so bathroom breaks and food runs take a while. Here is the positive....its a bucket list type attendance, the show including a stealth fly over is awesome, the game a BCS semi final was probably the best college football game in 2017!  First OT game in Rose Bowl history, most points scored, first meeting between OU and UGA. The experience was unbelievable!! Here is my tip:  take Public transport to Pasadena and walk the 1.7 miles to the stadium and be part of history."
6238,Date of experience: January 2018,3-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,1,Beautiful Rose Bowl needs an update,"Watched the best college football game ever.  Followed by the worst experience in getting out of the stadium and grounds.  50,000 people came by buses provided by the city of Pasadena.  After the game, in the dark, with staff that had no clue how to move 50,000 people to awaiting buses almost ruined the event.  It was dark and many older people were put in a dangerous situation, being told to keep walking to some unknown spot to find the end of the line.  This walk in the dark took hours, no clue how far we walked.  It was exhausting.The stadium is under-equipped with restrooms and the stadium steps are very difficult for those not in hiking shape..  Time for a make-over.  Keep the charm and make it worthy of the game itself.The unexpected benefit was the respect and help the Oklahoma and Georgia fans showed each other after they game trying to help each other out of this march through concentration wire fences."
6239,Date of experience: January 2018,3-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Awesome Venue! Horrible shuttle experience.,"First the good... This stadium is set in a beautiful location and having watched the Rose Bowl for over 40 years it was great to travel out and watch my Dawgs!The bad, both getting in and getting out was extremely disorganized. We wanted to take a shuttle up from the parade. We were told that the shuttles would depart at 10:00, when we lined up there was supposed to be one line that zig zagged through barriers however they were not qued properly. At 10:15 the first shuttle had not even loaded so we decided to walk the nearly 2 miles to the stadium. After the game was even worse, there was no clear markings where the shuttles were picking up, again we tried to find it and couldn't so we walked the two miles back to our car. It appeared to me that they were totally unprepared for the amount of people that were there."
6240,Date of experience: January 2018,3-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,2,rose bowl game,game was awesome but the rose bowl is old and outdated i feel. logistics of the parking and entrance and tunnels sucked.  perhaps it just couldnt handle the crowd but then again it is suppose to manage and expect a packed stadium.
6241,Date of experience: January 2018,3-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,1,100 years of experience????,"Besides the horrible traffic, the service staff there were ignorant of what and where things were in the facility, it seemed like they were never training.  We asked 20+ people in uniforms where the Will Call office was and either they did not know or looked at us with a blank stare and did not speak.  They were somewhat organized in getting you into the parking areas, but when the game was over it was a mad house, with nobody directing traffic to smooth out the flow of 20,000 cars.  This was THE WORST organized event I have ever attended.  I have been to many events just as large where the people wanted to help the attendees.  The hospitality (extra charge) area was just as unorganized as everywhere else on property.  They missed opportunities to sell more food and drinks because they did not have any organization or work flow to serve the customers.  The same person who took the order, took the money, and went to get the items you bought.  Instead of having order takers and some expediter delivering the order to the counter.  Why was there only 2-3 people at each booth and it seemed like one of the three was standing in the back watching???  The people traffic flow was sooooo congested, with choke points that were less than 6 feet wide as you passed the ""B"" gate, you had 1,000's of people passing through this 6' wide spot along with electric carts that had to move people out of the way or pinch them into the fence and rock wall to get through. The people flow to get into the stadium was much better, even with the security screening. The ADA access was non-existent, the electric carts were not to help ADA movement they were full of dignitaries even though the cars had the wheelchair symbol on them. Cell phone service was very spotty, if there was any at all.  I was at the Super Bowl in Houston and the organizers brought in extra WiFi and Cell tower boosters through out the area to make sure everyone had service and WiFi access.  I would NEVER go back to the Rose Bowl Stadium again, this was such a terrible experience.  Had to walk out of the area (and walking was way faster than driving) for 2 miles to get to the ride share pick up spot.  The Rose Bowl METRO Shuttle service line was a never ending MOSH PIT of 30,000 people and not well organized, The shuttles took you to Memorial Park to drop you off, then you would have to walk another 1/2 mile or so to the METRO Gold Line or a parking facility.  Would some one please teach these organizers how to run an event better than this."
6242,Date of experience: January 2018,3-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,1,Rose Bowl - Disappointing!,"If your team plays in the Rose Bowl, you want to support your team so you'll choose to go.  It's a logistical nightmare!  Infrastructure doesn't exist to support getting into the stadium, moving to your seat, or driving to pre-paid parking.  You can stand in line for a long time to get food and learn that in that line you can ONLY get drinks!   It took as much time to get to the game and to our seats that the game itself. In addition, the game announcer made error after error in crediting tackles to players on the wrong team.  The digital scoreboard for 2 quarters inaccurately represented the score.  The digital replay of a scoring drive was so delayed that they played it on the big screen just as the opposing team was starting their offensive possession (well after the media break and kick-off after the score.  Upside:  The stadium is in a beautiful setting of the mountains and the fly-over by the air force was spectacular!  Overall, the granddaddy bowl of them all is hype and a flop-very poor user experience!!  Be prepared to exercise patience when your team plays here!  Hope management figures out how to do it right - try modeling after AT&T stadium in Dallas."
6243,Date of experience: January 2018,3-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Rose bowl,The event staff were get friendly and the pregame transportation was excellent. The event was will organized and I felt safe. The only negative was that the post game transportation was extremely disorganized!!! We had to walk in a loosely organized extremely long line for nearly two hours to get on a shuttle. People with children in disabilities and the elderly suffered. There really really should have been a consideration for the fact that this people could not queue and walk for that distance.
6244,Date of experience: January 2018,3-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,1,Good game....horrible crowd control,"Considering the Rose Bowl is very old they have no idea how to manage an event.  Almost impossible to access.  The bowl site recommends using the metro,  over a mile from the stadium without a sign anywhere telling people from out of town where the stadium is.  Getting there is a piece of cake compared to getting back....3-1/2 hours in a line to get a shuttle, and even the shuttle drivers don??t know where the shuttle is going .....it stops in the middle of an office complex.....nothing open in the area....and not a policeman or security guard in site.  If your team gets in the Rose Bowl you are going to go BUT pay whatever the price is for parking at the stadium, plan on being in the parking lot at least 5 hours before and after the game. It is said that New Orleans is the best managed city in the Caribbean.....even New Orleans cant manage to mismanage a major event this badly.  In this day and age getting crowds away from venues is a major safety concern.  The after event crowd management at the rose bowl is a catastrophe waiting to happen."
6245,Date of experience: January 2018,2-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Don't count on shuttle for leaving game! Need back up plan!,"Rose Bowl Game.  Rode over on shuttle. No problem. Line around the 2 corners of block and then queue.  But it moved.  After the game... and award presentation... could not find end of line... walked 1/4 around stadium in ""line"" to see massive queue ahead of us.  So standing properly for 25 minutes we were led to parking lot where the ""end"" could not be found.  We gave up!  I think people are still in line there! Couldn't get cell reception, so followed a crowd to neighborhood with cell reception and uber.  Crowded, long walk.  Cell connection at Orange Grove Blvd & Rosemont. Finally success connecting with Uber at Lincoln &  Orange Grove Blvd.  Would have been a shorter way to that intersection.  Take a printed map if you are going to rely on cell service. Find out blocked roads first and where uber can get to before you go to stadium! Surprised leaving was so miserable with venue with such history. Let me know if this is helpful."

Even though our team lost, we were thoroughly impressed with the stadium and the whole atmosphere of the event.  It was a great game, and even though we were 72 rows up which is only 5 rows from the top, you could see great!  Stadium layout is awesome!

6248,Date of experience: January 2018,1-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,2,"Football game great, parking ridiculous","We were here for the rose bowl game. For what they make in parking, the least they could do is pay people to direct traffic after the game as well. We have literally not moved in the parking lot for an hour because it is a cluster. Totally ruins the experience of the game and the venue."

Truly The ""Grandaddy"" of them all.","I have attended the Rose Parade and Rose Bowl Game since I was a child beginning in 1966 for the game. Located in a beautiful residential area, unlike many stadiums relegated to industrial or tougher neighborhoods, the feeling is such a throwback except it is real and alive today! UCLA fans really have it made coming here to tailgate in the gorgeous surroundings, and there is no better experience than the New Years Day tradition of attending the Rose Parade live, then walking through the beautiful areas, past historic houses, and down to the parklike grounds leading to the Bowl for the very first New Years Day Bowl game, and still the best of them all! . Do it once and you may be hooked for life!"

6258,Date of experience: October 2017,25-Oct-17,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Rose Bowl Flea Market,The Rose Bowl Flea Market is a definite good time. It can definitely be overwhelmingly hot during the summer and early fall. Make sure you bring bottled water and your walking shoes. If it is your first time going just stick to the outer perimeter because it can be daunting at first.

I checked UCLA??s football schedule and was happy that they were home the same Saturday we were in town. I have no affiliation to the school, but as an avid sports fan the Rose Bowl is as famous as a place you can visit. Right up there with old yankee stadium, Fenway, Wrigley and all the other throw backs, the Rose Bowl did not disappoint. We got there early, parked north of the stadium and really took in the college football atmosphere. We dreaded the potential nightmare of leaving and the traffic, but the route took us quickly right back to the freeway and we were on our way. What a great way to spend a Saturday. We will be back."
6261,Date of experience: January 2017,20-Oct-17,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Worked the Rosebowl,Was fantastic to see such a remarkable stadium in person. Very well kept. Was a journey to get here and parking was daunting. But overall was a blast.
6265,Date of experience: September 2017,23-Sep-17,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Iconic but allow for plenty of time!!!,"This is such a great place to visit and you be able to take wonderful photos, probably 350 days of the year.  That said, unless you walk or bike there, this is never an easy venue to reach by car.  If you can take a bus/shuttle, often set up from Parson's in Pasadena, do it!  Also, don't miss the monthly Rose Bowl Flea Market, held the first Sunday of each month.  Finally, walking around the Bowl is a fun people-watching activity, and you will cover just over three miles."
6266,Date of experience: September 2017,20-Sep-17,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Historic and Fun Place for a Football Game,"Have been to the Rose Bowl on numerous occasions for UCLA Football in the last 3 seasons.  The Rose Bowl, although it is old and not the greatest stadium, is still a very nice venue and its sight lines are much better than the LA Memorial Coliseum where it seems like no matter where you sit, you are a long way from the action.  The Rose Bowl has been incrementally improved over the years and still has some way to go, but unless you are on the hard concrete seats in the end zone, it can be a nice experience.  It's been the site for many historic sports events like the annual Tournament of Roses Bowl game, Olympic events, World Cup Soccer championships and many other concerts and important events.  It's a place that has history and atmosphere.  One important thing is not park at the Rose Bowl.  When it is available, take Metro Gold Line to Pasadena and take the Bus to the Stadium."
6269,Date of experience: September 2017,13-Sep-17,Big Ten,UCLA,4,"Legendary, but not a great stadium","This is one of the most famous and important stadiums in all of sports. That being said, Its a lousy old bowl design that was built almost a 100 years ago. I loved the experience and being there, but the stadium itself is lackluster. Its over a mile walk from the parking lot (on a golf course). A must see experience for sure, but you might leave slightly disappointed. There is no upper deck, which might make finding seats a struggle for some. September game was brutally hot if you werent in the shade."
6270,Date of experience: September 2017,11-Sep-17,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Great classic venue to see a game!,"We went to the UCLA/Texas A&M game, and pre-purchased a golf course parking spot (very difficult to find though). This area is where most of the people tailgate, and can be a long walk to the stadium. We sat in the endzone, but didn't miss the game because when the ball was in the other zone the large screens kept you in the game."
6271,Date of experience: September 2017,7-Sep-17,Big Ten,UCLA,2,The UCLA/Texas A&M Football Game,"I was very surprised and disappointed in the Rose Bowl.  It is a very old and out dated facility.  The restrooms are mostly on the ground level.  The PA system is attorcious.  I could not understand anything that the announcer said during the game.  The access tunnel system is not adequate for the number of people attending the game.  Maybe I was expecting too much from all the television hype that surrounds the Rose Bowl, or maybe The Rose Bowl bowl game is more impressive."
6272,Date of experience: September 2017,7-Sep-17,Big Ten,UCLA,1,Old stadium - needs a bull dozer.,"Very similar to old Cotton Bowl Stadium in Dallas.  Structure is very old, limited bathrooms, and must exit stadium for food or restrooms.This was a 'bucket list' visit for us and very disappointing.  The 'bowl is one deck, but each row gets farther from the field."
6273,Date of experience: September 2017,4-Sep-17,Big Ten,UCLA,4,UCLA Football.. but very horrible parking,"My family and I attended a UCLA football game this labor day weekend. Let just start off by saying that the parking was horrible. Yes, there is people guiding you were to go, however the parking is on grass!! It's like a big park, and when the game finished, it was an extreme chaos trying to get out. No help from people who work there, good luck finding the exit. Inside the stadium was really nice. It's just as you would expect it. We sat in the general seating area and got some nice descent seats. It was a good game although UCLA got smoked thru out the whole game, but that's for another story. People that sell lemonade are nice, we got 2 lemonades from them each at $7 a pop, they come in nice size cups, just estimating about 32 oz. The stadium was also offering zip lock bags to put your stuff in since they weren't allowing to bring in big bags. However the stadium was nice, still horrible parking and at $30 bucks, it was expensive."
6274,Date of experience: September 2017,4-Sep-17,Big Ten,UCLA,3,football stadium bucketlist,"Attended a college football game here.  Always dreamed of going to the Rose Bowl, but the stadium itself is old, crowded, and rather run down.  You literally have to leave the stadium to go to the bathrooms or concessions.  And don't expect the big Jumbotron monitors.  They only had one smaller screen located on one end of the stadium and I never did find the play clock.  And they only showed replays when it was beneficial to UCLA.  The UCLA fans were loud and mouthy, not very welcoming but I did appreciate their support for their team.  The stadium is located in a very beautiful residential neighborhood, and is a little difficult to get in/out of due to traffic.  But they do provide a nice shuttle system to/from the Parsons Bldg nearby, which I would definitely recommend unless you want to park within painted stripes on a nearby golf course.  My opinion is to go take your picture in front of the sign and skip the game experience!"
6278,Date of experience: January 2017,29-Jul-17,Big Ten,UCLA,2,Iconic Stadium Needs Major Renovations,"Attended USC Penn State Rose Bowl.  Great game but the Stadium itself needs major renovations.  Seating needs steeper pitch -- my view of field was constantly blocked by people walking in the aisles in front of me.  My section had hard metal bleacher seating, so no back rests and no clearly defined seat.  Video board is sub-standard compared to NFL stadiums and many college football stadiums.  Parking and shuttles from downtown Pasadena were a nightmare.Concessions were disappointing and restrooms need updating.Overall, a very disappointing experience for a $500 ticket :("
6288,Date of experience: November 2016,24-May-17,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Beautiful Rose Bowl,"If you're here for a game or the famous flea market, this place is nice.  The restrooms are clean, the people who work here friendly.  If you're here for the flea market, have some good walking shoes, a little pocket money and have a blast seeing all of the wares for sale.  The things for sale, some new, some not so new and the antiques are beautiful and the variety of things is out of this world.For a game, this place is wonderful.  I've been for regular UCLA football games and for the ""Grand Daddy of Them All"", the Rose Bowl Game on New Years Day.  The place is very well run, yes they check your bags and you have to go through a metal detector to get in, but it's for our safety.  So, get there a little early, bring your patience and have a good time."
6305,Date of experience: September 2016,5-May-17,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Visited for Ucla vs Stanford football game,"Rose Bowl is beautiful and historic stadium.  One of a kind.  Must see a football game here.   For sure. However the peripherals are shabby and poorly maintained.   Restrooms are not nice and often over-crowded.   Be prepared to wait in long lines.  Also the largest negative about Rose Bowl is the huge, congested bottleneck of humanity that develops around the entrance area to the stadium about 45 minutes to 15 minutes before kick-off.   My goodness.  People can get hurt    Trampled.   Injured type of situation if Rose Bowl doesn't sort it out.  There must be a better way to organize the entrances in a more systematic and safer line-up format to enter the Rose Bowl."
6312,Date of experience: January 2017,11-Mar-17,Big Ten,UCLA,4,This historical stadium should be on your Bucket List,"Easy to find.  Parking is crazy for the Rose Bowl Game.  Get there super early or make alternative parking arrangements.  There are strict rules as to what you can take in and the size of your carryons.  I just took my phone, keys and wallet in my pocket.  Make it easy on yourself.  Once your ticket is scanned and you are inside, take the time to check out the various plaques and markings on the walls.  Plenty of eateries.  Bathrooms weren't too crowded.  Our seats were in the end zone right beneath the large screen so although we saw the game fine as it's not like you are up too high; we did not get to see any of the replays or special videos because they only have that one screen.   That would probably be the only thing I would change.  We saw a great game.  Leaving was pure madness.  Our friends who took the shuttle from downtown Pasadena said it took forever to get back to their car.  So just be prepared about the logistics.  Other than that, this is a must see place to visit at least once in your lifetime."
6314,Date of experience: October 2016,1-Mar-17,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Great Venue...But Don't Come Late,"**Warning: Be careful with the size of purse you bring in, they will not let you enter if it's out of compliance. Went to Rose Bowl to see Coldplay (amazing!). My friend and I got there early and didn't have trouble getting parked, but it did cost $25. There were a bunch of different stands that had food and seats outside of the venue, which was nice. Also, lots of port-o-potties. Getting into the venue to sit did take a really long time, and security was tight. Definitely leave lots of time for this. Once in, good acoustics, good views, super small seats though (knees hit the seats in front). Would definitely go again for another big name!!"
6317,Date of experience: January 2017,11-Feb-17,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Touchdown!,"We are huge Penn State fans so we decided to make the trip to Pasadena this past year to see PSU vs. USC.  The game was epic to say the least.  We wish the outcome would have been different, but we thoroughly enjoyed our trip to the Rose Bowl.  The USC fans were super nice and friendly, which made the trip so much better.  Overall, the stadium itself is historic.  We liked the idea of being there better than actually being there.  Since it was very rainy the days leading up to the game, the field around the stadium was extremely muddy.  It was disgusting walking to the game.  The stadium itself was smaller and narrower.  Also, I'm glad I'm an athletic person because there's shuttles to the stadium, but you have to arrive hours before to wait for one.  We decided to walk the couple miles through the neighborhoods to get to the stadium.  Finally, it took hours to exit the stadium.  The staff put up fences for people to wait for shuttles out of the stadium.  However, the person who set them up was not very intelligent because they set them up in a way that kept every person stuck in the stadium.  We spent at least 2 hours stuck in the stadium trying to exit it.  We finally made our way out when people broke a fence down so we could escape."
6318,Date of experience: January 2017,7-Feb-17,Big Ten,UCLA,2,Underwhelmed in Pasadena,"Myth, Legend, Iconic, Historic ... yes, it doesBut, as a sports venue ... lacking in so many ways ... grounds are ordinary, restrooms are few, crowded, and long lines ... concessions are limited ... crowded tunnels ... only one big screen available ... not impressed    ... Try the Big 10 stadiums for venues"
6319,Date of experience: January 2017,21-Jan-17,Big Ten,UCLA,5,"Iconic venue, a must for any football fan.","Just got back from attending my second Rose Bowl (alas both were Penn State defeats) and would highly encourage any football fan to make an effort to see a game in this iconic venue. The stadium itself, sits in the Arroyo Seco, an ancient dry riverbed a mile or two from Pasadena's famous Colorado Boulevard. The huge valley is quite picturesque, being ringed by the San Gabriel mountains in the distance. There is a huge ""green"" (lawn) in front of the stadium??which serves as a parking area and a golf course is located at the stadium's opposite end. The facility was built in the early part of the 20th century, so don't expect many (if any) of the modern amenities which are standard in newer stadiums and arenas. Firstly, the stadium was built as an oval and generally, with these type of stadiums, the higher up that you sit-the better the view of the action that you will have. This is because of the gradual slope of the seating, with the first 10-30 rows being relatively ""flat"". The seating consists of metal benches. Some have ""chairbacks (mostly the rows between the twenty yard lines and some of them don't. To my knowledge, there are no club seats here, although there is a rather large press box-so I'm sure that there are some private suites as well. There are 2 scoreboards, one at the top of each end zone but only one of them is a ""Jumbotron"" allowing you to watch the game and see replays. Concessions and restrooms are located outside of the seating area and ring the stadiums perimeter. There are a huge variety of concessions available here but it isn't possible to watch the action on the field while waiting in the beer or hotdog line. Similarly, the restrooms are small and cramped, so expect huge lines at halftime. Finally, both access and parking can be difficult as well. The stadium is accessed through (mostly) two lane roads and most (if not all) pass through residential neighborhoods, virtually ensuring that both ingress and egress will not be quick!Despite all of the faults that I've detailed, I'd still recommend viewing a game at the Rose Bowl. The event itself, is the attraction here and nothing detracts from that. Modern stadiums, flush with amenities are nice but they the sorely lack the history and soul of stadiums like the Rose Bowl. If you ever happen to be sitting here on New Year's Day watching a football game being played on green grass while looking out at mountain peaks in fall-like weather when most of those watching at home are wishing that they were you-then you'd know what I'm referring too!"
6321,Date of experience: January 2017,13-Jan-17,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Nice Old Stadium For Football,"Back again since 2014. Seating=higher seats are better that lower seats. Parking is still very important. Seriously consider Lot H, if available. Worth the price. Easy in and easy out. The 2017 Rose Bowl game was fantastic!"
6322,Date of experience: January 2017,8-Jan-17,Big Ten,UCLA,1,DUMP!!!!!  UCLA should be very ashamed.,"This stadiuhm hasn't been renovated in decades.   Far too few restrooms.  Lines for both men and women over half hour long.  Some stairways are actually dangerous.  I am 4'10"" and 65 years old and our seats were in row 76 of 77.  The stairs up had NO handrail a d each step was at least 12 inches high.  It was an incredible struggle for me to get up the stairs until a gentleman saw me fighting to raise my short, old legs and helped me.  Then,  up that high, there are no restrooms.  I would have had to go all the way down and back up.  No way could I do that.  Husband went down at beginning of halftime for bathroom and, due to long lines, didn't get back until halfway through third quarter.Parking is just as bad.  Haphazard, no organization.  Friend was parked so far away, he didn't get into game until halfway through first quarter.Questions below.  I don't recommend this stadium in any weather.  UCLA should be very ashamed of the conditions here."
6323,Date of experience: January 2017,8-Jan-17,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Rose Bowl Game! Wow,"After parade, we tailgated until it was time for the football game started! Great thing to do on New Year's Day! USC vs Penn State! Fun day. A must do!"
6324,Date of experience: January 2017,7-Jan-17,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Rose Bowl 2017,"Went to see the Rose Bowl 2017 and it was a great experience. Only 3 ways to enter by vehicle, so expect a long wait for a stadium that seats close to 95k. Old stadium so none of the flashy stuff, only one screen to look at. Seats are all bleacher style seats, so bring a cushion. Amid the mountains, it is a nice sight."
6325,Date of experience: January 2017,7-Jan-17,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Not going to review the game,"When stadiums sell beer and other alcohol beverages to especially students and other young people, it means that there is undoubtedly lots of drunken folks sitting nearby.  Their crude and rude behavior made for an uncomfortable situation for those of us who were trying to watch the game.  Drinking beer requires one to continually walk in front of others on the way for refills and bathroom breaks.  Restroom and food lines were extremely long.  But . . . we got to see the Rose Bowl (even though my team lost)."
6326,Date of experience: January 2017,7-Jan-17,Big Ten,UCLA,4,"Great time & memories, but be prepared for long lines everywhere","Penn State vs USC game was a thriller that helped create great memories.  I was unable to secure tickets beforehand, but was able to work with a scalper.  The game was a VERY hot ticket, so there were inflated rates and no negotiating.  The tickets ended up being in the USC section, so our Penn State apparel clearly stuck out.  While many of the USC fans displayed low class, we never felt in danger.  Getting thereWe took the Metro Gold Line to Memorial Station, which turned out to be a great move.  It was $1.75 each way, and dropped us a few blocks from the stadium shuttles.  It was safe before and after the game.  The line to get on the shuttles was literally about a mile long, but it kept moving.  We were there 3.5 hours before kickoff, so I'd imagine the line got longer after us.  We were supposed to meet friends for a tailgate on the golf course, but signage was weak and the area was quite crowded.  We determined it would take too long to get to the tailgate and back to the stadium, so we hung out near the stadium where there were ample food and beverage options.  They also had big screen TVs to watch other football games.  The majority of ""seats"" are bleachers, so you get to become close with your new neighbors.  Lines for restrooms were long, but moved at a decent pace except for halftime.  At least one of the concession stands had computer issues, causing long delays and forcing us to use cash if we wanted to move along a little faster.  Be prepared for an expensive day:  as a benchmark, 16 oz beer inside the stadium is $14.  A brat and fries was a $20 meal.  I'm glad to attend the game and experience the Rose Bowl, but don't relish the idea of returning."
6328,Date of experience: January 2017,5-Jan-17,Big Ten,UCLA,5,USC vs. Penn State,"Amazing to have finally checked this off my bucket list!!!  Such a thrill to be part of the ""Granddaddy of them all""!We walked from the parade route (Colorado Blvd. near Orange Grove) to the Rose Bowl and it took about 40 minutes (it's about a mile and a half, but you're going around freeway interchanges and lots of people).  We could have taken a free shuttle but a) we wanted the walk after sitting and getting a bit cold at the parade and b) the line up of shuttles was tremendous and at the point that we got to the shuttle area, nothing was leaving yet, so we figured walking was easier.We met friends at the golf course, adjacent to the Rose Bowl, just north of the stadium, to tailgate.  Once at the golf course, we had to walk a long way around Penn State's alumni tailgate to get to our friends' area, but that only amounted to 10 more minutes of walking.From the golf course taligate, we left at 1:00 for the 2:00 kick-off.  The security line was a bit of a mash initially, but then we were funneled through metal barricade bars (a la any amusement park line).  If you have NO bag, there is an express line.  If you're carrying your clear tote, you go through the regular line.  Everyone goes through a metal detector.  This part took about 25 minutes.After you're through security, you get to the stadium gates where you present your ticket to get in.  This only took 5 minutes.  We entered at section 14 and had to walk around to get to our tunnel 10.  It was crowded with people, but this only took about 5 minutes.  We were in our seats at 1:45 and there was still a marching band on the field.There is no covered concourse:  it's all outdoors on this main entry level.  Concessions and bathrooms are at the same lentry evel.  Once through your tunnel, your seats are either up stairs or down stairs.We were in a section of bleachers.  There is not enough room to be comfortable.  We were literally squished next to our seatmates the whole 4 hours.  bleachers are numbered, but as soon as a ""large"" person fills a space, the person next to them loses some of their space.  It's kind of dog eat dog.  We put up with it because it's the ""Granddaddy"".  We stood most of the time, which is expected. Beers were $14 so do your best at the tailgate!The stealth bomber flyover started from the end zone with the jumbo-tron; good to know if you want to anticipate photo opportunities; don't know if it's this way every year.You won't regret it if you're a football fan....I'd go again in a second!"
6329,Date of experience: January 2017,5-Jan-17,Big Ten,UCLA,4,A Memory Maker,"We went to the Rose Bowl for the PSU vs. USC game. Being there was just surreal. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was the infrastructure was old and it was quite tricky to go up and down the bleachers. Also, you had to go a long way to get to the restroom."
6330,Date of experience: January 2017,5-Jan-17,Big Ten,UCLA,2,Very poorly managed.,"Lines at the restrooms were long.  Lines to the concession stands were long.  No concession stands directly inside the stadium (like the coliseum).  I used to think the Coliseum was terrible however it is 10x better than the Rose Bowl.  Bad access to stadium.  Barricades everywhere which makes you feel like cattle.  If it wasnt for the Rose Bowl, I would not have gone to the game.  I will refuse to go there for a regular season game."
6331,Date of experience: January 2017,5-Jan-17,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Rose Bowl!!!!,The granddaddy of them all. Love this stadium. Go if you have a team you want to watch. It's in a fabulous area and full of energy. Haven't been in 30 years and it's still amazing!
6333,Date of experience: January 2017,4-Jan-17,Big Ten,UCLA,3,The Rose Bowl Game,"I wanted this stadium to be all that I had hoped, as it was on my Bucket List. It is a tremendously famous stadium, and  classic looking , but it was cramped and tight to anyone 6 feet or taller. We couldn't understand any of the PA announced calls or messages. Nobody could! The acoustics were terrible, nothing but echoes and muffled sounds. Really expected to actually hear and understand what was announced. PA, field microphones, even the officials calls. After the game ended we got caught in a mob mentality crowd blocked in from exiting to the parking lot, blocked from the entry to shuttle busses, and barricades prevented an ambulance to get through with a patient aboard! More than 30 minutes passed before several stadium workers and police moved some fencing, barricades and got the crowds to finally begin to exit. Not organized for 90,000 + fans to move safely out of and away from the stadium. It was a snap-finger away from a semi riot. Rose Bowl committee, please get this improved."
6334,Date of experience: January 2017,4-Jan-17,Big Ten,UCLA,2,WTH??,"Wow, I was shocked at the Rose Bowl Stadium from the parking attendants and the seat ushers to the outdated quality of the stadium. It took us almost 2 hours to go from Rose Parade to the stadium parking. Reason? No one was directing traffic. Cars were blocking intersections by just not moving; police present on site were all in a group chatting; people were getting out of their cars to complain...It was a nightmare. Once in the stadium, the usher had no clue where the row I was sitting in was. He kept telling me to proceed down from the tunnel when in actuality, I needed to go UP. Luckily, I know my number line and was able to figure it out. There are limited bathrooms, which can be a typical complaint, but these are very outdated. One stall was literally a door leaning against the frame off hinges and all. Inside the stadium there is only one big screen to serve as a prompter for replays, etc and it happened to be behind me. Inconvenient to watch a game backwards. All in all, it needs updated."
6335,Date of experience: January 2017,4-Jan-17,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Excellent venue for a game.,"First time at the Rose Bowl, but I've been to plenty of other stadiums. This one is one of the best. The Rose Bowl committee makes things easy for the spectators, much like at the Augusta National. They issued a spectator booklet and there were plenty of signs leading the way to the stadium."
6336,Date of experience: January 2017,4-Jan-17,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Once you're in it's truly an experience!,It's a beautiful stadium and great venue to watch football once you get in. Leave yourself plenty of time to stand in line at security and getting into the tunnels. Higher seats offer better vantage point for viewing play development. Its called the most famous of all stadiums for a reason and rich in history! It's a nice walk from the parade to the game and you can avoid the traffic.

Great site lines, fairly comfortable seating and easy to access by Uber and foot.  Hope to return in the future"
6340,Date of experience: January 2017,3-Jan-17,Big Ten,UCLA,2,Rose Bowl Transportation,"After reading community reviews we decided to take the shuttle to and from the Parsons parking lot to the stadium. The trip over was super easy and based on reviews we expected long lines for the rerun trip. What we experienced on the return trip was quite scarey. People were pushing into line, several gates had been toppled, at one point, people were knocking bikes over and pushing to get into a small opening and we actually saw one person with a bloody nose. Where there were security personnel they did their best to control the crowds, but in the spaces were there were no personnel, it was pandemonium. Never experienced anything like it. We ended up walking back to pasedena as the shuttle is really the only form of transportation and the line stretch at least 3/4s of a mile 2 hours after the game ( captured the distance on a fit bit) The chaos may have been due to an overly rowdy and inebriated crowd and the game went down to the wire meaning 90,000 people leaving at the same time. The walk back was not far ( regardless of what the reviews say as you do not follow the bus route) Uber was stationed one mile from the stadium and would only pick up there and there were no cabs. If you go, either leave the game early or find an alternative way home. They say the wait is not that bad in line, but the human factor was down right scarey and we heard on a police scanner that three bricks had been thrown at one of the shuttles cracking the windshield."
6341,Date of experience: January 2017,3-Jan-17,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Rose Bowl/Rose Bowl Parade Experience,"Out of Towners, we weren't sure of the best way to experience both the Rose Bowl game and parade. We ended up arriving at 6 A.M and got a fabulous parking experience. From there we walked into town for the parade. We weren't sure Uber could get us into town due to road closures. We were far down the parade route, the 1500 block. The Rose Bowl is close to the beginning to the parade, about a 1 1/2 mile walk. The 1500 block is about 3 miles. There was a huge line (I mean huge!) for parade holders to enter at the beginning of the route. Security was insistent that we enter there,  but then a program director, told us we could walk on a parallel street away from the crowd, a much better solution. Yes, it was a long walk but certainly doable. Great place to tailgate, but don't drink too much of any beverage! I've never seen lines to Port-a-Potties so long. Waiting in a cue 20 to 30 minutes is unacceptable. Same thing happened inside the stadium where I missed 20 minutes of the game at the end of the 1st quarter.  Ironically, lines for food seemed reasonably short.Plenty of security was visible in the stadium. They monitored alcohol consumption. The stadium was fine, but old. Wish the had a second big screen for easier viewing of replays."
6342,Date of experience: January 2017,3-Jan-17,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Bowl Extravaganza,"Old stadium with terrible parking arrangements. Either (1)Uber close to the stadium and walk the last .5-1 mile or (2) arrive 3-4 hours before game time. (3)Drive to your designated lot and pray for a miracle that will get you through the parking mess, better known as the ""Pit of Despair"". Or try door (4), and drive as close as your nerves will allow, and park wherever possieRble (public or private yds) and again, walk the rest of the way.  Ugh, the parking experience is a nitemare!!  Did I mention this already...the parking! ...A Nitmare!!!  The food was good, with some interesting selections. Loved the crepe sandwiches! The stadium itself is a sort of neat/cool older venue....and you will enjoy it in a nostalgic way; but again, only if you survive the parking lunacy of this location; which basically is masquerading as anything remotely organized.     So be warned.....plan your drive well, when attending events at the Rose Bowl."

In all honesty, the place is no longer fit for purpose and should be pulled down  or severely renovated, neither of which is going to happen due to its status as one of college football's iconic stadiums"

I prepaid online.  Otherwise, it's $15 Cash Only.  I was able to find a space without any problem.  The shuttle was right next to the parking structure.  It was big and comfortable and took us to the stadium within minutes.  After the game, I left 10 minutes early to avoid the crowd. I did not have to wait to get on the shuttle to Parsons.  My overall parking experience was excellent.  I will park there again.  Also, the shuttle avoided different street closures to private vehicles to the stadium.  Thanks."

If you go all the way around it's a little more than 3 miles and there is usually always free parking unless there is an event. There is a separate path for joggers and dog walkers. You can also bike around but you will be on the street with traffic. Lots of green areas too to warm up/stretch out in or walk the dog around (not off leash)."

There has to be a better way to get 100,000 people into this stadium! These issues need resolved for better enjoyment. Had I known the entrance would be so slow and crowded, I would have entered the stadium much sooner. I barely made it to my seat in time for the game!

It is the most exciting bowl game period.  The stadium itself is dated.  The bench seats are terrible.  The entrances are congested and cause large lines to form.  But I don't think anyone was there to admire the old stadium.  We were there because it is the Rose Bowl game.

I have always wanted to see the Parade and my family wanted to go for the Football.  Clearly last minute means no hotels near Pasadena, but HEY  that's OK!  Here's a summary of how we made it work by staying in LA:1. Flights: Fly into Burbank.  We did Southwest and Burbank is an easy airport to navigate.  Then taxi, super shuttle, uber or rent a car.  We did Uber.  Super Shuttle is $17 a person, Uber was $60 to our hotel, so we went the Uber route.  Cheaper for 4.  LAX is just a close to LA as Burbank, so pick what fits your schedule/budget.2. Where to stay: Again, nothing in Pasadena so we stayed in LA.  We stayed at the Hilton Doubletree, not super fancy, but very suitable.  What you want to look for is a place that is near the Metro.  The LA metro runs a gold line to Pasadena, with even more stops on Super Bowl game day.  The Doubletree is walkable to Metro.  It's in a neighborhood that has a lot of homeless, so that is the only downside.  A taxi ride is $4, but my family of 4 walked and we were fine.  It was a sunny day and there were others walking with us.  It was a 10 min walk!  Easy.  Right into the metro station, down to the Train.  At the train gate they sold one way and round trip tickets, so don't fret about getting a ticket in advance.   The upside of Doubletree?  Starbuck inside the hotel and great little restaurant also connected.  3. The Parade: Metro Gold Line drops you 1 block from the Parade Route on Arroyo Parkway.  So at the midpoint or so of the Parade. There is ""Free curbside seating is available on a first-come, first-served basis at three stretches along the parade route.  People camp out for a spot as early as 12:00 Noon the day before the parade.  Of course we didn't do that, but you don't really need to.  It is very easy (although tight at times) to walk down the sidewalk, or stop and watch.  You can see it ALL.  Of course, if you're a serious viewer and you want a spot with a seat you'll want a ticket in the stands.  But is it not needed.  I got beautiful pictures, the walking gave us a good sense of the neighborhood and the people and there is wonderful street side vendors cooking fragrant food. Skip breakfast and buy on the street if you want a true taste of this event.4. Post Game.  Here's my flub.  We SHOULD HAVE gone to where they park the floats to get an up close look.  I totally forgot about that. We got caught up in the end of parade scatter and needed to use the restroom and I'm hungry madness that kids always have.  So we stayed around Old Pasadena (which is super adorable by the way, but not many stores are open on this crazy crowded day).  Restaurants are.  We went to Le Pain Quotidien, which is on Colorado (the parade street).  Fresh bakery and sustainable food mission.  Bathroom line was LONG, but we got a table in 20 min.  Staff extremely nice.  Highly recommend this kind of break in your day.5. Getting to the Stadium.  Very easy, very walkable if you don't mind a bit of a hike.  We walked from our brunch to the stadium.  It's about a mile and a half.  Just don't say that out loud to your kids because it is a fun walk and it sounds longer than if feels.  There will be a lot of other doing the same, so pretty easy to just ""foliow the crowd"".  You'll walk down a hill partly on sidewalk and partly down a well worn path.  You'll see the Rose Bowl Stadium on the way down. Then through the ""tailgaters"" and to the entrance.6. Arriving at the Stadium.  We had to stop for our Stubhub tickets, which was very easy and fast in the Arrival Tents.  Enjoy this little moment of madness.  You'll find yourself in Selfie, Family Pick and team game goods-land.  Tons of people, lots to see and buy.  My daughter wanted a Stanford scarf but don't buy it yet.  You don't want to walk in with a bag... there are many vendors inside the stadium as well.   Prior to entering the stadium-- Don't carry bags.  We didn't have anything other than wallets (mine was a small clutch).  This is IMPORTANT because the line to get in for no bags is much, much shorter than bag check.  7. Inside the Stadium.  Everything was perfect.   So many vendors and bathrooms that there were no lines.  We were on the East side so we had sunshine, bring sunglasses.  We were in the lower seats around the 30 yard line...near that controversial stanford band!  Great seats and sunny.  Remember to look and make sure you are sitting with your team.  When you buy your tickets make sure you buy correctly.  The poor Iowa fans on our side were outnumbered for sure.  You will find pins, hats, tee shirts, etc all available for you as well as lots of food, beer and soda.  Typical football game but a bit more ""snappy"".  8.  Post game.  We hiked back out to Old Pasadena.  Yes, you are now going UP, but it's easy if you don't mind a little huffing and puffing from the kids and you're in decent shape.  It will be dark, but again you are not alone.  Use your smartphone flashlight.  We wanted to eat at Urth which is on the opposite side of Pasadena, but we walked it anyway.  2+ miles.  You could get the shuttle by the stadium (very longggggg line). Or grab a taxi once you hike up (we're too cheap for that).  We just walked.  Dress in layers, it was chilly if you didn't have a jacket.9. Back to LA!  We could have metro'd but we Ubered.  It was $27 to Uber back to our hotel.  No big deal and then we didn't have to worry about the Little Tokyo neighborhood issues.  Again, nothing bad, just a lot of folks down on their luck.10. Getting home.  We flew out the next day out of LAX.  No checked bags so we traveled light.  So GO.  It was fun.  Best if you can stay in Pasadena and enjoy the shopping.  They had all the favorites on Colorado that are probably open prior to game day.  So glad we went."
6420,Date of experience: January 2016,10-Jan-16,Big Ten,UCLA,5,A hell of a experience,"Rose Bowl game 2016 was my first football game ever. Now I know that I started big. I'm a huge soccer fan and what I saw in this game I had never seen it in a soccer game before. Very different experience.Arrive early so you pass security before it get crowded. Also, if you don't got tickets in first hand, buy your ticket at Stubhub. I bought my ticket just a few hours before the game started ;)"
6421,Date of experience: January 2016,8-Jan-16,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Rose Bowl Game with Al Brooks Tour,This was our first time to see the Rose Bowl Football Game.  We booked this game as part of our tour with Al Brooks Tours which made the experience excellent and stress free. Our coach bus brought us to the stadium early enough so that there were not long lines to enter or go through security.  We had a great box lunch on the bus; so no need to buy food at the game.  Our seats were on the lower level on the side near the end zone. There are extra Al Brooks employees outside the stadium to help you find your way in and back to the bus. The bus was parked near by and was able to leave fairly soon.  Hotel and sightseeing are all part of the tour package that has many options.
6423,Date of experience: January 2016,4-Jan-16,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Great atmosphere in a beautiful setting,"This stadium is dated and lines are long. They also have issues with entering the stadium that create an unbelievable wait to get inside. The beauty is in the atmosphere, weather, and tailgating location (mountain view)."
6424,Date of experience: January 2016,4-Jan-16,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Amazing Rose Bowl Game,"We attended the 102nd Rose Bowl game and what an experience.  We walked from the Rose Parade to the stadium and it wasn't a bad walk.  Since many people do this, it seemed that driving up to the stadium would take a while and when the game was over, people who parked at the stadium had to deal with thousands of people walking down the main streets and it was difficult for them to get out.  Once we arrived at the stadium, everything was set up very well.  The food was amazing in the tailgating area and the vendors had a lot for people to do while they waited for the game to start.  Security was fast and got a lot of people through quickly.  The gates were clearly marked and the bathrooms clean.  It was a great experience."
6425,Date of experience: January 2016,4-Jan-16,Big Ten,UCLA,2,Major Updates Needed,"While I realize this is cherished grounds for college football and has great tradition, this stadium is a dump.  It took almost an hour to get in the gate, 1/2 hour every time wanted a beer or food or use bathroom.  If the tunnel was half full they would close it.  I am sure it was great 50 years ago but it is terrible place to watch a game now."
6426,Date of experience: January 2016,3-Jan-16,Big Ten,UCLA,5,First time to attend the Rose Bowl,"Great experience but the Iowa Hawkeyes lost...????. And, as long as you leave early enough the traffic wasn't as bad as one may think. Unfortunately, I can say if you leave early the traffic wasn't bad... Yea, that's how bad the Hawkeyes got whooped...??"
6427,Date of experience: January 2016,2-Jan-16,Big Ten,UCLA,3,"Beautiful Location , Lots of Waiting in Line","Love the location among the mountains and part of town,  logistics need work spent about an hour trying to get in to the game (rosebowl).  Sight lines were better than anticipated.  We're were at the top end zone and still felt a part of the game."
6428,Date of experience: January 2016,2-Jan-16,Big Ten,UCLA,2,"Beautiful Venue for Football, but Bench Seating is Outdated","Stunning view of nearby mountains. Shuttle from the Gold Line is very well-organized, and moves people as quickly as a bus bridge can.Bench seating rows are very close together, and narrow aisles to the concourse quickly bottleneck. At the end of a high-attendance event, you feel like people have crawled over you for three hours.They do have a pretty wide variety of concessions.You can somewhat mitigate the limitations with a game plan. Get your food / drinks early, and find your seats before the aisles back up. Plan your concourse visits to avoid ends of quarters."

Beautiful exterior surrounded by palm trees. Worth the side-trip."
6433,Date of experience: November 2015,15-Nov-15,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Classic stadium,In town on business decided to mix in an little fun and it was.  The Rose Bowl is a classic.  Great game amazing staff very friendly to out now state visitors.  I would go back again in a minute.   Be prepared to wait to get in security very tight but I would rather have the extra security and be safe and have fun.
6434,Date of experience: January 2015,11-Nov-15,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Rose Bowl Experience,"This is a classic football stadium with a lot of history. The location is without equal being in close proximity to golf courses, tennis courts, world-class swim stadium and the San Gabriel Mountains. The stadium's loud speakers can be somewhat loud to those with sensitive hearing!!"
6436,Date of experience: October 2015,23-Oct-15,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Home of the Rose Bowl Game - Enjoyed Goilingng to the Cal vs UCLA Game,"We went to the Cal Berkeley vs. UCLA game (UCLA Game).   We had a good time.  The fly over of the 2 military jets was impressive during the Star Spangled Banner.   We liked watching the game.  It was the 2nd Thursday night football game for UCLA.  There was a special half time show with some of the cast members from the Las Vegas MGM show KA.We enjoyed watching the game, but it was a bit lopsided with UCLA winning and looking the most impressive.  Final score was UCLA 40; Cal 24.We stayed at the Courtyard Marriott so took the Old Pasadena shuttle, which is free, to the game.  It is a very convenient location with lots of parking.  The line to get on the bus to the game was ""short"".  The line at the end of the game was long - but it moves along very nicely.There is a variety of food vendors at the game.Seating was good to see the game.We have visited the Rose Bowl a number of times, so this was a repeat visit.The only thing odd about the game is that most universities have a football stadium on the campus, the UCLA students and alumni are willing to continue for years to drive all the way from Westside of LA to Pasadena.  Happy they do, but did want to note."
6437,Date of experience: October 2015,14-Oct-15,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Soccer Fun,"Got to go see a huge soccer game here with 93,000 of my closest friends.  The stadium did a great job of handling the crowd, and I don't think there was a bad seat in the house.Concession prices were awfully high, as is expected at all stadiums."
6438,Date of experience: October 2015,14-Oct-15,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Awesome tailgate,"We attended the US-Mexico CONCACAF Cup soccer game here. As an older stadium, the food and restroom facilities inside are pretty limited, but the tailgate and activities outside before the game were excellent. There was lots of room for tailgating and thousands of people just having a good time."
6439,Date of experience: August 2015,12-Oct-15,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Historic and old fashioned,"Old-fashioned bowl - a real bowl - that is the center of a vibrant outdoor scene of golf, cycling, walking, running, and swimming"
6441,Date of experience: September 2015,23-Sep-15,Big Ten,UCLA,4,"Rose bowl go see it,awesome.","So much history there it was a great experience being there to watch the BYU / UCLA Football game. Seating was a little tight but was not to bad. The parking on the stadium grounds is filled first and then on the golf course parking. Which is not that bad if you get there early a short walk required. You can bring in some small snacks and sealed water bottles and your own stadium chair if you want. Surprisingly it was so layed  back. The bowl holds over 92,000 so be patient. After the game it's a mad house but everyone was pretty good and courteous. The traffic is controlled pretty good.  So go and have a good time."
6442,Date of experience: September 2015,23-Sep-15,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Old cement has soaked up lots of history!,"I've attended many UCLA football games over the years.  Be prepared with a hat and sunblock if you attend a day game.  Many food vendors with a wide variety of treats!  Getting out of the parking lot at the end of an event can be a pain - go with a group of friends in a motor home, as you get to park along the street west of the golf course, giving you a straight shot out of the bowl!"

6446,Date of experience: August 2015,19-Sep-15,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Another landmark stadium to check out,"I've been here a few times.  I've hiked around here, watched the fireworks on 4th of July, and went to flea market days on 2nd Sundays of the month twice.  The one thing I have not done; is watch an actual game here.  There's tons of parking here.  If you go to watch the fireworks, I would recommend parking on the street because you could get stuck for over an hour.  If you come here for the swap meet (recommended) the earlier you get there, the better parking (free) you get.  I loved buying old books and finding good furniture to rehab so you may love this place if you're also into that."
6447,Date of experience: December 2014,18-Sep-15,Big Ten,UCLA,2,Great fireword,"This review is for July 4th Fireworks event at Rose Bowl.1. Fireworks: EXCELLENT!! Still the BEST Fireworks in LA. Every year has different creative presentation. 2. Parking: FWY 134 E, off ramp is back up on the freeway already. It took over 45 minutes to get in the parking lot after exiting the freeway. Only 2 staffs (lines) to pay the parking fee and have to merge into only one line to get into the parking lot. Many staffs are inside the parking lot ready to direct the traffic but the parking entrance is taking way too much time. Maybe should consider to open up more lines or entrance for people to get into the parking lot. 3. Food Vendors: After get in the stadium, food is always the next thing come to mind. The food vendor at the front gate is very disorganized. There is no assembly line for preparing the food. The cashiers are yelling out the orders but no clear communication with the staffs who are preparing the food. In addition, the food quality is awful and way over priced!! Since there is no sign stating there are other food vendors in front of other gates, people all waiting in long line at this particular food vendor which is right after entering the main entrance. Maybe should have sign giving directions to other food vendors. It also helps to spread out the crowd. 4. Staffs: Inside the stadium, many staffs wearing yellow uniform to assist. They make it so much easier to find the seats. Great job!!"
6449,Date of experience: September 2015,15-Sep-15,Big Ten,UCLA,5,"Great Stadium, nice crowd","I visited because I was in town on vacation and this place is famous and highly ranked compared to other college stadiums. About 70,000 fans showed up and the weather was perfect. From what I could tell, any seat is a good spot to catch the game. The concessions are pretty pricy, but there is good selection. I would definitely go back."
6450,Date of experience: September 2015,14-Sep-15,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Flea Market heaven!,"I've been wanting to go to this event for a long time and it did not disappoint! It is so large that I don't think you can fit the whole thing in in one day though. There are many food vendors as well. HINTS: bring your own water as it is $5 a bottle there, also take some kind of backpack or cart as it is easier to haul things around!Can't wait to go back for a game too. The stadium is actually open for viewing and there is an electric energy in it even when it is empty!"

This occurs at the Rose Bowl Stadium every second Sunday of the Month.  You can walk and walk and walk....AND I always find great deals!  It is so enormous that it is impossible to finish walking around the entirety of the place, so it is best to saunter around and soak in the variety of items for sale.I enjoy talking to the endless venders about their unique products and this swap meet has EVERYTHING from one of a kind items, brand new items as well as used or vintage items, which includes clothing. It is a treat to peruse this behemoth swap meet every so often because it is nice interesting outing."

6455,Date of experience: January 2015,12-Aug-15,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Epic,"Even in the BCS era, there are few games that rival the Rose Bowl.  I've been to four of them and you really cannot beat the atmosphere.  Due to the configuration of the seats, there is not a bad seat in the house.  You may have to contend with the SoCal heat for part of the game, however the stadium sits in the Arroyo Seco, which allows spectators to cool off once the sun goes down."
6456,Date of experience: January 2015,4-Aug-15,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Bucket List Item,"College football in the Rose Bowl is truly a magnificent experience.

The place is nuts - not for he feint of heart or people who don't like crowds. I wouldn't want to do it every month if I lived there, but it's certainly something I'd do two or three times each year.Check it out..."
6479,Date of experience: January 2015,25-Mar-15,Big Ten,UCLA,5,The finest football stadium anywhere,"There is no better place to spend New Year's Day than in a seat somewhere in this amazing venue. When the sun sets, putting a pink hue on the San Gabriel Mountains, you'll swear, much like Shoeless Joe Jackson in Field of Dreams, that you were in Heaven. I can't speak to what the stadium is like on non-game days, but if you are in town and have a chance to take in the history and splendor of the Rose Bowl Game (presented by Northwestern Mutual), spend what it costs and get yourself a seat."

I have been to the stadium few times for a Rose bowl game and Nebraska vs UCLA game. Going to a road game you never know how the fans are going to treat. For the majority of the fans were Nebraska, so that could be why.  overall its a great stadium to watch a game."

Really interesting stadium, almost 100 years old, some upgrades, but old school (no seats, only benches).  They do have some upgrades and while the bathrooms were a problem, they apparently added a lot more capacity.  We enjoyed the game and I would go back again if I have the opportunity"
6486,Date of experience: January 2015,10-Feb-15,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Must go!,"I had the opportunity to join my Alumni group this year at the Rose Bowl. Getting into the stadium was a pain so be sure to get your drinks, food and potty break done before you stand in line because it is very slow moving to make it thru the gates. Arrive early. Once inside you have to wait again to get through the tunnels to where the seats are. Again potty break, food and drink before you find your seat ... but maybe not too much drink because a round trip from your seat could take 30 to 40 minutes. Once you get settled in your seats it is amazing. The field seems so close. Ti was the best game ever ... but ... we did win which contributes to the experience.  Read the rules before you go of what you can and can not take into the stadium and remember it can get cold when the sun goes down."
6487,Date of experience: January 2015,6-Feb-15,Big Ten,UCLA,4,The Rose Bowl 2015,Incredible game. Marvelous atmosphere but the stadium needs a makeover. Horrible to get in and out. Lots of food and beverages available but visit the bank before you come.

This is a very nice stadium with ample parking and location.  However, the prices for food and drink at the stadium are outrageous.  I don't mind paying a little more because of an event venue, but $14 for a beer (Coors at that) and highly inflated fast-food items are bordering on stealing.  Imagine... almost $100 for a six-pack.  Sinful!"

We had the suite and I don't think I can sit in a regular seat again.  We also had parking pass which came incredibly handy as parking can be quit a distance.  Upon arriving at the stadium we were welcomed by stadium employees and every time we encountered an employee on the walk up the numerous flights of stairs there would be an employee there welcoming us to the stadium.  Employees dress professionally and all are eager to assist you with a smile.  Once in the suite we had a spread of wonderful Wolfgang Puck dishes and beer, wine, and soft drinks.  The suite has a couple of TV's and is sound proof. When you open the door to go to the stadium seats you can literally feel the crowds energy and hear it too!!!  The roar goes right through you.  It was so exciting and the view of the mountains is spectacular.  For someone who doesn't like football I had one of the best times ever!!"

6500,Date of experience: January 2015,9-Jan-15,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Rose Bowl PARADE__Do Go__Best Seats Seats,"Don't know if you attended yet but one company Sharp Seating has a monopoly on all seats. We attended Jan 2015. We purchased our tickets 6 months in advance (Section 150 on S. Orange St)  We got there and read this is the ""formation area"" and wouldn't see all participants. AND, the eats were were blocked by trees (15-25' tall with leaves), street poles, and palm trees with only 20' between each.. We were furious. Drove to Sharp's office and they reluctantly exchanged them (at $19 restocking fee per ticket) for seats on the Highway Overpass (Section 235) with NOTHING blocking the view, great sun on the entire float for good photography. Section 240 is better as sun is at your back. If you get to seat by 7:15, you'll be fine. You should look at stands and Google, some bleachers on the route are blocked by buildings flanking them meaning you can only see floats when they are directly in front. Nearly all had trees and lamp posts in front of them. This parade is 5.5 miles long so there are lots of spots to camp out on the street overnight if you'd like. However, it was 30 degrees the night before. We found purchasing the parking pass $40 was helpful, just be sure to park by the exit. Lots of port-of-potties around too. Also, the bleacher seats are super tight so you are crammed in. Some of the bleachers look like they go up 60 rows, others just 5 rows. They are aluminum which means a cold bum, and the $10 seat pads at the float building site were much thicker and nicer than those sold for $15 at the parade itself.Would highly recommend working on the floats. We volunteered with Paradiso but also check out Fiesta Parade Floats, and Phoenix Floats. SIgn up online for a 4 hour shift. We ended up staying 10 hours we loved it so much. You really get to appreciate the floats up close. Lots of tasks so can sit or stand or climb. Paradiso was great if you wanted to change tasks or locations and they were a delight to work with. Both floats Zappos.com and Singpoli won awards too! The floats are view-able later that day and 2-3 days after for $10 in some parking lot. They are pieces of work. We opted not to do the football game but that's within walking distance."
6501,Date of experience: January 2015,7-Jan-15,Big Ten,UCLA,5,A Football Fan's Bucket List Must-Do,"2nd time at the Rose Bowl. We learned much from our first visit - arrive early, enjoy the environment, tailgate a bit then begin your trek into the stadium 1 hour before kickoff. Despite a multi-million dollar makeover between our 2011 visit and our visit 1/1/15 for the Oregon/FSU College Football Playoff Semi-Final, access to the stadium is challenging. Public shuttles are a nightmare of waiting in a queue. This year we purchased on-site parking located on a public golf course north of the stadium. Tons of room and bit of a chore to get onto the freeways, but definitely the way to go. Once inside the stadium added port-a-potty's help with accessing rest rooms quickly despite 100,000 fans packing the place. Food and beverage always high at these events but decent quality. At the end of the day - watching the sunset on San Gabriel Mountains as the game enters the 4th quarter brings chills for any devout sports fan looking for those moments in time you will never forget."
6503,Date of experience: December 2014,6-Jan-15,Big Ten,UCLA,5,A Life Time experience,I loved the floats! They are outstanding! The bands were great too.We enjoyed the horses. It is a great time for the whole family.You have to see this parade at least once in your life time.
6504,Date of experience: January 2015,6-Jan-15,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Bowled Over,What a terrific stadium where every seat is excellent and there is an immediacy to what is happening on the field.  Restrooms and food are limited but fill the need.
6505,Date of experience: January 2015,6-Jan-15,Big Ten,UCLA,4,The Rose Parade,If you've never seen the Rose Parade up close you can't imagine the intricacy of the floats. They are just magical. The marching bands and horses provide the rest of the entertainment.We stayed in the city of La Puente because it is far enough away from the crowds but close enough so we could get to the parade route quickly. Once in a life time- just saying!
6507,Date of experience: January 2015,6-Jan-15,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Rose Bowl Game; Worth the effort,"My dream since I was a child, was to attend the Rose Bowl Game;We parked 2 miles away and walked; Easy and one walked through a lovely residential area of Pasadena;   The shuttle was available but the line was very long;The stadium; is old school but so wonderful; We had seats in the ends zone; It was easy to get in and out of our seats to buy food and drinks;  By the way; $13 for a can of beer! Unreal; Our seats were more like benches;  We had fun fans all around us from Oregon and Florida State;We easy to walk 20 yards to public restrooms with no wait!  Security was very present and was needed 10 rows in front of us; They were very professional in dealing with the situation; We had a great experience; We took the shuttle back to our car with 10 minutes left in the game; the line was long but we were loaded onto the shuttle in 10 minutes;  Loved being in the Rose Bowl; Would go back again!!Go Ducks"
6508,Date of experience: January 2015,5-Jan-15,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Historic old Satdium,Its true the Rose bowl is a bit worn but its a timeless classic venue  and I enjoyed my recent visit. I remember coming to there back in the 70's and 80's as a child. My most recent trip toi the Rose Bowl was A bit of a walk down Memory lane since I hadn't been there in over 20 years.  Its true parking is a nightmare that's why i opted for the shuttle from Old Town.
6509,Date of experience: January 2015,5-Jan-15,Big Ten,UCLA,4,What a classic,Walking up to the stadium was a special experience.  Looks exactly like it does on TV.  I can understand why the athletes who play there think it is special.
6510,Date of experience: January 2015,5-Jan-15,Big Ten,UCLA,2,A Logistical Nightmare!!,Have to go to the restroom? Better get there 45-50 minutes before you have to do your business because the lines are long!  Was there for 2015 Rose Bowl game and was shocked at the nightmare involved to get something to eat or drink and use the facilities.  At least one men's restroom was closed off due to flooding and the lines for the others were 120-200ft long!  I understand the structure is very old but at least consider making additions regarding the number of restrooms!   Stop spending money on renovating the press boxes and start spending money on more restrooms and concessions or you will lose fans!  Food and drink also very expensive - I don't mind paying more because I know it's a sports venue but $12 for a cup of lemonade feels like I'm being gouged.
6511,Date of experience: January 2015,5-Jan-15,Big Ten,UCLA,5,NO BETTER PLACE TO SPEND NEW YEAR'S DAY,"I attended the Oregon vs. Florida State College Football Playoff game on New Year's Day in 2015.  The game was absolutely great.  This historic venue tucked into the mountains is a stunning location for exciting sporting events.  The tunnels are old, the food ain't great, but you get a sense of the past which adds to the charm.   It holds over 100,000 fans and there really isn't a bad seat. I appreciate this place."
6513,Date of experience: January 2015,4-Jan-15,Big Ten,UCLA,2,"Still a tired, old stadium","So after being here in January, 2014 for the Natl. Championship game I swore we'd never come back.  That was before the Seminoles returned for the first BCS playoff game.  We came back.  The stadium is still awful.  YES, it's historic.  But the tunnels, the bathrooms, the lack of decent, quality vendors. The ridiculously overpriced food that was barely edible.  Don't mind paying high prices but some quality would be nice.   Come on Pasadena, you can do better than this."
6514,Date of experience: January 2015,3-Jan-15,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Go Ducks but not the food at the Rose Bowl,"Lovely antique bowl, but the food is 'fast' - not quality and can't bring food into game. The B2 Stealth fly over was nice.  I think an upgrade for the technology is needed as they only have one large TV screen at one end of the field - need a 2nd one."
6515,Date of experience: January 2015,3-Jan-15,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Beautiful Parade,A event that everyone should do at least once.  The preview of the floats in the barn was so interesting on how they are made and the man hours of work that it takes.
6516,Date of experience: January 2015,3-Jan-15,Big Ten,UCLA,4,"It is no Autzen, but much nicer after upgrades","I have been to The Rose Bowl three times over the past seven years.  The upgrades have certainly added benefit to the fan experience.  Fan access is easier and there are more facilities and options for food and drink.  The setting is beautiful.  Parking is OK with the adjacent golf course, but the connecting streets were not made to handle 91,000 fans.  As the title says, The Rose Bowl is no Autzen or Husky Stadium...but, it is a top three or four in the Pac Conference."
6517,Date of experience: January 2015,2-Jan-15,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Rose Bowl 2015,"We were spending a week in San Diego after Christmas and decided at the last minute to drive up for the game-Oregon v Florida State. Both fan bases were well represented. Although we were neutral, we got into the act and cheered for both teams. Although there seemed to be many drunk fans I didn't witness any physical altercations and the defacto home team, Oregon, went home winners!!"
6519,Date of experience: October 2014,2-Dec-14,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Premium seating at The Rose Bowl,"Looking at college football stadiums on Saturdays across the country, The Rose Bowl seems to be a very fine stadium. We were lucky enough to purchase some premium seating on the D level in the Club lever of the big press box. These seat are in from of the Loge Boxes of the press box. The view is great of the game as well as the mountains surrounding Pasadena, and you receive a complimentary buffet access, and to many areas available to have a cocktail. Our event was a UCLA football game."
6520,Date of experience: September 2014,2-Dec-14,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Beautiful location and surrounding facilities,"The Rose Bowl hosts popular entertainment acts and athletic games.  The tailgating is superior because it is primarily on the Brookside golf course so lots of grass.  Sometimes parking is limited, the concessions are ridiculously expensive and the restrooms could use an upgrade.  Overall a good venue."
6522,Date of experience: November 2014,29-Nov-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Iconic landmark doesn't disappoint,"If you have a chance to go to any function at the Rose Bowl -- do it. We went to a UCLA football game and had a wonderful experience.  There are a lot of food choices and some of it quite tasty. But, as at all places like this, the prices are high, $8 for a bottle of water! you are allowed to take your own bottled water and light snacks into the stadium grounds.I say that with a cautionary note. The place (of course) was crowded but the people were cordial and there was no problem with this mass of eager fans. The walk from where we were told to park to the stadium was very long, at least a mile each way. But we followed the crowd and enjoyed the view -- especially of all of the paraphernalia people set up for tailgating. We even saw a small satellite dish attached to a huge flat screen TV at one family site.This was an experience to remember.NOTE: This was a noon game and we sat in the south bleachers protected from the sun by wonderful shade as were the people to the west of us. Those in the other parts of the stadium were in the hot sun, it was likely a lot less comfortable there."
6523,Date of experience: November 2014,25-Nov-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,USC/UCLA 2014,"Came from Baltimore to see USC/UCLA game at The Rose Bowl Stadium. This was a Stadium I have always wanted to see a game at. There were huge tailgating parties in a field next to the stadium which was a cool experience. The stadium is huge, it has some seats with backs (sides) and bleachers in the end zones. We sat in section 18 row 71 and had a perfect view of the entire game. I enjoyed the experience, even though USC lost, I found that most of the UCLA fans were very respectful."
6524,Date of experience: November 2014,24-Nov-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,USC UCLA,Loved the Rosebowl to watch football games. Love the atmoshpere and the seating. Added restrooms are a plus.
6525,Date of experience: November 2014,24-Nov-14,Big Ten,UCLA,4,It was a visit to a place of collegiate football history,"I liked the USC President Max Nikia's pre-game tail-gate party that included the USC cheerleaders and the band before they marched into the stadium. l like the game, even though my team didn't win. It was wall-to-wall non-moving humanity at half-time in the aisles."
6526,Date of experience: November 2014,23-Nov-14,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Another UCLA victory!,"Enjoyed many exciting games here as an UCLA undergrad and now a lifetime Alumna member. Site of incredible games~New Year's Day, 10 Year Reunion, Bowl Championship Series this year and most recently against the Trojans. The amount of work for these events are astonishing."
6529,Date of experience: January 2014,11-Nov-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,American Football History,I have always enjoyed the football games at the RoseBowl. There is such a college football history here. USC VS UCLA and other great Colleges. The Swap meet is fun to attend on the Sundays when they have it.
6530,Date of experience: October 2014,11-Nov-14,Big Ten,UCLA,4,"Try the ""slider house"" food booth next time your at a game","This is such a great place to go all the way around.  How can anyone not like to visit Pasadena and go to the Rose Bowl.  Next time your there for a football game definitely try their new ""Slider House"" food booth.  Great burgers!  Don't let the line formed at this booth make you walk away.  worth the wait!"
6531,Date of experience: October 2014,3-Nov-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,UCLA football,We like to park and take the shuttle bus into the Rose Bowl. We are always pleasantly surprised at how organized it runs when so many people and cars converge for each game at the Bowl.
6532,Date of experience: November 2014,3-Nov-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,"History, exercise, landmark, cultural experience, all in one!","This place is so special to me, as I've been here many times since I was a kid. But my favorite thing to do is walk or run the 3 mi loop around the bowl and the adjacent golf course. There is a Lane just for exercising. I do suggest avoiding Saturdays if you are looking for fewer crowds. Once a month on Sunday in a flea market which is also a fun attraction. It is not free entrance, fyi."
6533,Date of experience: September 2014,3-Nov-14,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Cool Stuff,"The Flea Market has a lot of really hard to find things.  If you want to find old relics or stuff from your childhood, it is probably there. The only downfall, is the way patrons can't seem to find the trash cans, they throw their trash everywhere.Expense is based off of when you enter, earlier the more expensive you will pay."
6534,Date of experience: September 2014,2-Nov-14,Big Ten,UCLA,4,The Grand-daddy of them all,"Its the home of the UCLA Bruins and the Rose Bowl. A terrific stadium that despite being in a town that is not too close to a freeway system, the traffic moves very well in and out. Where else can you go and park on a golf course? My secret revenge."
6535,Date of experience: September 2014,27-Oct-14,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Famous,"Even people who are not big football fans have heard of the Rose Bowl, the annual January 1 game played there is so famous. There is also a great flea market there. Virtually unknown fact: my grandfather provided all the lumber for the stadium's benches when it was first built."
6536,Date of experience: October 2014,17-Oct-14,Big Ten,UCLA,4,BIG!,"Went to a UCLA/Oregon football game and was amazed at the amount of fans crowding the stadium, parking lots, and streets.  In a beautiful location, the Rose Bowl offers lots of space for the tail gaters. It??s well organized but the stadium seating is cramped and uncomfortable. After sitting in the 95 degree sun for several hours, I was thrilled to walk outside to find some shade by the bridge. Had a lot of fun at the game but wouldn??t want to be a homeowner in the area. So glad I visited but once is enough!"
6537,Date of experience: October 2014,15-Oct-14,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Getting out of there is the only detraction,"I have been a UCLA season ticket holder for almost 30 years, so I am very familiar with the stadium on typical game days and for the Rose Bowl Game.It is a great venue. Sight lines are excellent. With the upgrades made in the last couple years, the in-stadium experience is outstanding. You can even get a cell signal now!For tailgating at a UCLA game, arrive 6-1/2 hours before the game and park in lot H to be ""where the action is"". Cheerleaders, bands, food options if you don't bring your own, plus the team walks by to come to the stadium.  If you can't arrive that early, tailgate on the golf course north of the stadium. Bring your own food and drink because their aren't many food sellers there until you get really close to the stadium. The drawback for the golf course is it will take a long time to get out of there and onto a freeway. Lot H is a lot better for that.As for seating, between the goalposts you get an individual seat, behind the goalposts are bleacher style benches. You don't want to be too close to the field, because the bowl has a more gradual rise than other stadiums and all you will see are helmets over the sideline. Stay away from rows lower than 15."
6538,Date of experience: October 2014,12-Oct-14,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Iconic Venue for Football,An amazing view is just the beginning of your experience to the Rose Bowl. Sight lines in the stadium are superb. The amount of elevation change for the distance from the field is nearly perfect. When you are a few rows back from the action you are at the right elevation to see the players clearly without binoculars.The aisles are wide enough and the slope appropriate for easy access. Plenty of restrooms with easy access. A variety of food vendors are located in many public areas close to seating. Parking can be a challenge if you need to be close to the stadium. If you arrive late you may be parked on the golf course a long ways from the stadium to walk and there are no restrooms on the way to the stadium.
6540,Date of experience: September 2014,3-Oct-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Bruins game,"Not a bad seat in the house, best part is autumn football in a great tailgate setting.  Nice place to ride the back, grab a dog then head in for a game.  People watching is great.  Nothing like college football in So Cal in the fall"
6541,Date of experience: September 2014,29-Sep-14,Big Ten,UCLA,4,The City of Roses,"Attended a football game.  The stadium is not hard to find.  Lots of signage and directions to the venue.  It can be expensive.  Parking lots can be crowded.  On warm days, take water; it can get hot out there.The crowd was electric.  While there are challenges with parking, the energy from the crowd is awesome. I would want to do it a lot of the time but it is a tremendous experience."
6544,Date of experience: September 2014,16-Sep-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,The Rose Bowl Flea Market is a must do!,"We had so much fun here, even with the heat at 100+ degrees on the day we visited. So much to see and so much to buy. Luckily we had checked an empty bag in anticipation of the shopping. Lots of seating and shade for breaks. We stayed 5 hours and maybe saw half of the market. I want to go back~"
6548,Date of experience: September 2014,15-Sep-14,Big Ten,UCLA,2,Parking almost ruined my good experience,"Took kids 2 nights to One Direction.  A Thursday and a Saturday.  The Rose Bowl is a nice venue and seems to have been renovated since my last visit many years ago.The show was great and the kids loved it.The food is ridiculously overpriced.  When purchasing an overpriced water bottle they remove the cap and won't let you have it indicating some people like to fill the bottles up, put the cap on and then throw it like a missle.  Well I didn't want to drink my water right away so I had to walk around for an hour with two open bottles of water.  I recommend smuggling in your own water or bringing your own caps.  They sell the Dasani brand so make sure you have one of their caps so it fits.I don like they way there are so many seats in between the aisles.  If your seats are mid row you have to crawl over about 25-30 people either way just to get out.Now for the parking.  I know I had the option of parking in Pasadena and being shuttled in to the event but I heard the shuttle lines could take an hour or so so I did not want to do that.  I got there at 330 pm and the gates opened at 500pm.  I got right in to the golf course parking lot and was directed to pull face in against the netting next to the driving range.  This was a mistake.  I have a large SUV.  I HIGHLY recommend anybody directed to park like this to back it in.  After the show I was trying to leave and it was impossible to back out with the amount of people walking by and the cars that had already developed a line to get out.  No cars moved for the first 45 minutes.  It took over an hour to get out and this was on Thursday night when the crowd was the lightest.Their parking system is TERRIBLE.  They need to hire someone who can come up with a better Game Plan than they have.  There are lots of people directing you in and hardly anyone directing you out.On Saturday I did not go in to see the show, I just dropped off and went in to Old Town via  shuttle and then came back to pick them up.  I  parked on the golf course but before the show was over, I moved my car near an exit.  We got out in 5-10 minutes and saved about an hour of waiting.Lastly, they had a parents lounge at the Golf Club.  It was $5 to enter and you could redeem the money inside as you were given a ticket to apply to your order.  My wife paid for us while I was moving the car then when I arrived we went inside with the wrist bands we were given.  We bought some drinks and realized the guy at the door never gave us our tickets.  We went back out to let him know he didn't give us our tickets.  He was rude and adamant he gave us the tickets.  I don't know his name but he was working the door on Saturday night at about 9pm.  He was a jerk.One last thing, If you go up the escalators that are just below the suits there are some concession stands up there that are less crowded.  The water bottles were $1 cheaper and they didn't take the cap off and the food was slightly cheaper than the other concession stands below.  Go figure?"
6554,Date of experience: September 2014,8-Sep-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Historic and Beautiful,"We stopped by the Rose Bowl Stadium to visit and take pictures on a beautiful sunny day in Pasadena. They are just finishing up an extensive remodeling to the exterior of the Stadium and already its more spectacular. There's so much history here and as a football fan this place is second only to Canton Ohio for hallowed football ground. As a longtime Wisconsin Badger fan its a great place to visit. With the remodel, all the teams of the Big 10 and the Pac 10 are honored and listed. The beauty of the San Gabriel mountains in the background is even more breathtaking in person than it is on tv. Pasadena is a great town with wonderful people."
6557,Date of experience: August 2014,23-Aug-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Best flea market ever,Arrive early and pay the extra $2 to get in at 8am - that way you get great parking and the crowd is less.  The artists and craft people are around the stadium and then the paved parking lot is the flea market.  No matter what you're looking for its here.
6559,Date of experience: January 2014,19-Aug-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Can't beat the Rose Bowl on Jan 1st,"Simply the best Bowl experience there is for college football.  Have been to two bowl games and have thoroughly enjoyed the pre-game festivities surrounding the stadium and then the games themselves.  A great venue, hope to be back someday."
6560,Date of experience: October 2013,16-Aug-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,College Football and New Years Rose Parade - Nice Grounds,"We have gone to the Rose Bowl stadium several times to see collage football games.  The stadium which seats 92,000 plus is in a neighborhood setting in Pasadena.    The views from the seats we have had at the stadium have always been good.The stadium is also the site of the Rose Bowl game usually held either on New Years Day.   We normally watch that game however on TV instead of go to the game.Parking for the games we have gone to has been a challenge. If one gets there early enough there is parking on the field where one can do some tail gating before the game. We have found however that staying in Pasadena at the Marriott Courtyard and walking across the street to the game bus shuttles is the easiest and best way to get to and from the game.The line moves quickly to get onto the buses - although at times especially at the end of the game, the line for the shuttle bus seems to be a very very long line.We also know people who go to the Rose Bowl area on non game days just to walk around the area for exercise."
6571,Date of experience: January 2014,30-Jul-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,A must see while in California,We attended the National Championship game between FSU & AU (GO NOLES!!!) at the Rose Bowl and had the time of our lives! It was amazing watching our Alma Mater take home the BCS Championship in Pasadena. The Rose Bowl Stadium is such a historical place and is just as beautiful as you've always imagined. Its a must see while in Cali!
6574,Date of experience: January 2014,26-Jul-14,Big Ten,UCLA,4,2011 New Years Day - UW vs TCU,My 2nd parade and 1st ever Rose Bowl game. Pretty decent stadium with good views from any of the seats. This is a classic game I have watched all of my life and enjoyed being there in person to experience the amazing traditions.
6584,Date of experience: August 2013,24-Jun-14,Big Ten,UCLA,4,HOW much for parking???????,"Too much!  Otherwise, that's my only complaint.  This place is a historical masterpiece of football greatness.  Please visit if you're in town!  Also, GO BRUINS."
6586,Date of experience: January 2014,3-Jun-14,Big Ten,UCLA,3,"Parking, Parking, Parking","Going to the Rose Bowl, for TravelinAlan, is all about parking. Not getting in, but getting out. Having been there many times, it is worth it to pay extra for some kind of preferred parking. It is easy to get trapped on the way out when there is a big crowd. I am not a fan of the extremely slow exit. Handicapped parking is very good.The public transportation option is ok to get there. Leaving will involve long lines to get on the transfer buses. As for the Rose Bowl itself, they have done some upgrading. However, the lines to use the toilets seem just as long as my first visit in 1959."
6588,Date of experience: January 2014,7-Apr-14,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Great job on the Rose Bowl 2014,"They did a great job putting on the Rose Bowl 2014. Tons of people, cars, you name it and all of it went smooth. If you want to see the rose parade before the game, buy tickets way in advance from a sales person on the phone who will help you pick out good seats."
6589,Date of experience: January 2014,7-Apr-14,Big Ten,UCLA,2,Is this place safe?,"Atmosphere was AMAZING for the BCS National Championship.  Traffic flow was a disaster.  Very close to people being trampled because of poor traffic flow immediately following the game.  Shuttles were a disaster, but its only a 2 mile walk to Old Pasadena.  The tunnels getting in and out...how is that not a safety hazard?"
6591,Date of experience: November 2013,4-Mar-14,Big Ten,UCLA,4,UCLA Bruins Football Games,"As a UCLA Bruins fan, I attend most home football games at the Rose Bowl.  I never have to deal with parking because of the convenient free shuttle from Parsons in Old Pasadena.  I live close enough to walk to Parsons and avoid paying the $25 parking fee and traffic.As for the stadium...the new renovations are excellent.  I only wish they would upgrade the seats and tunnels.  During big games, they tunnels can be a little tricky to navigate with my toddler.  The sightlines are excellent from nearly every seat in the stadium."
6593,Date of experience: January 2014,2-Feb-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Rose Bowl Champions!,"Our MSU Spartans were the victors!!! Best part.  The stadium is nice, you can see from any seat.  It is a bit older, but this means plenty of legroom!!  We loved being there for the 100th Rose Bowl.  The shuttle line to get back to Colorado Blvd was horrid!  Heads up; arrange a ride or, if you are able, walk!"
6595,Date of experience: January 2014,20-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Great place to walk!,Not only do we enjoy going to the Rose Bowl to  watch games but e enjoy walking the 3 mile loop around the Rose Bowl. It's a beautiful walk with the mountains and trees. Lots of people watching as well! We can ride bikes too!
6596,Date of experience: January 2014,20-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,4,BCS Game at the Rose Bowl,"We had visited the outside of the Rose Bowl in August never dreaming we would return for the BCS game. Followed advice to leave early and to use Waze to find back roads to stadium...a breeze. Parked on the golf course and tailgated...perfect weather. Again, went into stadium early to avoid the tunnel crush. Also hit the restrooms first. There was already a line but attendants helped it move along. Our seats were on row 73...just four from the top. Our seats had a good view, and it was nice to have seat backs. However, if you wanted food (expensive) or the restroom, it was a trip down, out the tunnel, and to the outer ring. All concessions and restrooms were on this level. Same thing exiting the stadium...everyone out these narrow tunnels. Then when we hit the golf course, no attendants. We heard later that they come out an hour after the event ends. Why? Also, Waze didn't help us going back because all the suggested routes were barricaded. A great day just be patient if you're going to those big events."
6598,Date of experience: January 2014,17-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Excellent time at the Rose Bowl,We were in town for the MSU/Stanford game and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  We had a parking pass around the stadium and were able to tailgate and only a short walk in.  We had ticket issues and the will call people handled our problem beautifully.  Stadium food was expensive - $5 for a water but what can you do?  My only suggestion is go in to the stadium early - an hour before game time is not too crazy for a special game.  The reason i say this is to get to your seats there are narrow tunnels you go through which have a hard time handling the capacity so it takes a while to get in.  Basically your ticket gets scanned at the main gates and all the food/beverage/restrooms are on the outer ring where you enter.  Then you go through the tunnels to get to your seat.  We had enough time before kick off but i wish i had known to leave more time - we missed some of the warm ups etc.  A great time was had by all.
6599,Date of experience: January 2014,17-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Historic and Fun Day at the BCS Championship,"Because we had heard so many bad things about the Rose Bowl, maybe we were elated to find it wasn't nearly as bad as reported.  We got an early start because parking was said to be very limited and expensive.  We parked on the golf course and had a wonderful tailgating experience!  Following the cart path led us to concessions which were reasonably priced and above average (CA Pizza Kitchen - $20 for 2 people!).  The golf shop was a disappointment.  We attempted pictures in front of the stadium but too crowded.  Once open, we made a bathroom stop - there were attendants that kept the line moving.  So even with a long line going in, it moved efficiently.  The dreaded tunnels were not a problem for us - we entered 1 hr before kickoff.  Tunnels were attended and they would hold you outside while the tunnel cleared.  It took 20 min to get to my seat, but visited with fellow Auburn Tigers so time passed quickly.  Strategically we didn't eat or drink before going to our seats, which were #11 and #13 on our row.  However, our neighbors had tiny bladders and you are up and down letting people in and out.  We took advantage of this by having them bring us a drink or popcorn.  Leaving was a bigger chore - took a long time as both bottom and top sections use same tunnel.  Food was disappointing - mostly bratwurst type hotdogs.It didn't feel like a National Championship game - just a big game.  Even Auburn home games feel more prestigious.  But it was a nice experience and the weather was the biggest bonus."
6600,Date of experience: January 2014,16-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,4,"Excellent, Unique Overall Experience","My 9-year old son and I attended BCS championship game in January 2014.  The surrounding mountains, tailgating on the golf course and the charm of old Pasadena were all unique and wonderful.  The Rose Bowl stadium itself was so-so, our seats (35-yard line) were okay but we were too far (row 71) to see well.  The stadium's layout is dated and the replay screen was small (compared to modern stadiums).   Everyone warned us that parking/traffic was an issue so we took the metro from our hotel in downtown LA and it worked great."
6601,Date of experience: January 2014,16-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,The grand daddy of them all,"We had the most amazing time at the Rose Bowl...and the Spartans won!  The stadium is located in a spectacular setting, with mountains, blue skies and warm weather!  We went from the Rose Bowl parade to the stadium...we thought we were going to walk...but it would have been about 5 miles; we got lucky and got a cab.  You have to wear layers if you do parade and game (the weather was 47 at start of parade to nearly 80 at tailgate).  The stadium is beautiful and the staff very helpful and kind.  The food at the stadium is yummy and unique (mexican and traditional stadium fare).  To go to the Rose Bowl is a must do!  To have your team win is amazing and on the 100th anniversary of the Rose Bowl!  LA was very welcoming and a great city for a bowl game! So proud of Spartan Nation!  Go green!"
6602,Date of experience: January 2014,15-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,2,Ugh those tunnels,"This stadium may be historic, but it needs to be torn down. I can't believe this place is such a dump. Those tunnels are a disaster. This stadium was not worthy to host the BCS game of 2014."
6603,Date of experience: January 2014,14-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Michigan State 2014 Rose Bowl Champs!!,"I was at Rose Bowl Stadium for The Rose Bowl.  My team won so that was extra special - the game experience was 5 stars, the venue itself was very nice, 4 stars.  I've seen pictures and TV images of the Rose Bowl thousands of times, but seeing it in real life is quite a treat.  (It's pretty easy to get your picture in front of the stadium with the Rose Bowl sign in the background.)  Ahead of time, I heard nightmare stories about the bathrooms, but our group of 2 men and 3 females had no problems using the restrooms at all (similar to any other sporting venue).  I like the little fenced in courtyard around the perimeter of the stadium where they sell food and merchandise.  Our group thought the stadium food was quite good and the prices were average compared to any other sporting event.  I can't comment on the parking because we parked in Pasadena for the Rose Parade and walked over."
6604,Date of experience: January 2014,14-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Unique Experience,"For the National BCS Championship I was able to go visit this historic stadium. It was definitely a treat. The view from the stadium is spectacular, especially of the mountains. I had heard it was best to use the bathrooms before going into the stadium. So as soon as we made it in the gate that was our first stop. One line was super long and at the next set of bathrooms there was no wait. We sat in the top of section 24 and sure it was not the best view of the field, but it wasn't a bad one."
6605,Date of experience: January 2014,13-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Awesome experience.,"We went to the BCS National Championship game last week and really loved our time there. We'd both heard that the bathroom situation was sub-par and that you could miss almost an entire quarter of the game just waiting in line for the restroom, so neither on of us risked that during the game. We ate outside the stadium, as stadium food tends to be expensive, but the options they had smelled great during the game. We took public transportation from downtown LA to Pasadena and then walked about 2 miles from the stop to the stadium (we didn't want to wait for the shuttle offered). We were glad we decided to walk--Pasadena is beautiful. The stadium itself is also beautiful and has mountains as the backdrop in certain seats, but I do wish it had more tunnels or exits or whatever you want to call them. Nevertheless, it is a historic venue and we are proud to have marked it off our bucket list."
6606,Date of experience: January 2014,12-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Historic Stadium,"Attended the BCS National Championship game, Auburn vs FSU. Our first visit to Pasadena and the Rose Bowl. The stadium is aged a bit but a great venue for a football game. Our seats were great, view was spectacular. We were on the press box side 30 yard line and could see every thing possible. The game was very good even though we lost. FSU fans sat next to us and were first class the entire game. This was a very enjoyable experience, all the ushers were very polite and each of them said ""Welcome to the Rose Bowl"". Wish all the new stadium seating were built like this instead of upper decks that are straight up and hard to climb steps. Concessions were hardly ever crowded, may be due to the  high prices. It was a memorable experience in an historic stadium."
6607,Date of experience: January 2014,12-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,2,Tired Stadium,"Rose Bowl has always been on the top of the bucket list & finally our Seminoles played there for the BCS game.   This stadium is historic but wow, do they need to spend some money & upgrade the place.  The food vendors were boring & over-priced.  More men's bathrooms than ladies & how the fire Dept. lets them get away with those tunnels is questionable. At one point we were stuck in a tunnel & could not enter the stadium from all the people trying to get to their seats.  At $385 per ticket (face value) they need to offer more than a historic name. Glad I came . . never going back."
6608,Date of experience: January 2014,11-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,BCS Game @ Rose Bowl Stadium,"Great atmosphere for football, variety of concessions, lots to see while in Pasadena - restaurants, bars, stores, etc"
6609,Date of experience: January 2014,10-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,4,2014 Rose Parade and Rose Bowl,"1. Rose Parade.  Definitely a wonderful spectacle - so much different in person than watching on TV.  Unfortunately, beware of Sharp Seating, which controls all reservations for grandstand seating, and prescribes to ""bait and switch"" tactics.  I received email confirmation of $90 seats in the section I requested; yet two weeks later received tickets for seats in a totally different location.  I called the company and supposedly was forwarded to a manager, who gave me a story about how they oversold the section; however, they moved us to a section which was an upgrade, normally reserved for VIPs. As we learned when we got to Pasadena, not true!  The original confirmed section was in a much better location.  Additionally, when I mentioned it to some other folks at the parade, Sharp had pulled the same stunt with them.  So, don't take for granted you will get seats in the section confirmed by email.  Thumbs up to the Rose Parade; thumbs down to Sharp Seating.2.  Rose Bowl.  Excellent service and customer relations from Vivid Seats!  They delivered everything promised with the tickets - from seating to parking.  Their agent even worked with me to delay shipment of tickets until I would be home to receive them.  Thumbs up to Vivid Seats for a great experience. ."
6610,Date of experience: January 2014,10-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,2,Good But Old,"The Rose Bowl is historic I was excited to be there 1/6/14 for the College National Championship.The problem was that I had seats behind the goal post. It turns out you cannot see the ball game from these seats. When you have paid $1,200 (face price) for four seats you would at least expect to see the game. You had to stand on your bench to see the field except that the tall guys in front of you were standing on their seats which meant I saw nothing. I left the game after the first quarter.Not to happy with FSU and the Rose Bowl committee making a rip-off like this."
6611,Date of experience: January 2014,10-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Auburn v. FSU BCS Championship Game,"The setting is spectacular!  The neighborhood and surrounding grounds are wonderful and well manicured.  The stadium, from the fans perspective, is outdated as small little tunnels (generally filled with sewer gas) lead out to the seating area; however, once inside the view is phenomenal!!!"
6612,Date of experience: January 2014,10-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,A dream come true,"My second visit to the Rose Bowl was every bit as magic as the first. The Rose Bowl is a dream destination, win or lose. Fortunately, for me, my team won the game on Jan. 1, 1988, and again on Jan. 1, 2014.Our seats, even facing the sun, were ideal. Fans in our area, some in red and some in green, were never obnoxious.Managing a huge crowd can't be easy, but Rose Bowl personnel did a fantastic job of getting people in and out of the stadium. I didn't use the stadium concessions because the Michigan State University Alumni Association provided a fantastic tailgate feast, complete with beer and wine, on the adjacent golf course."
6613,Date of experience: January 2014,9-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Awesome setting for a football game,"My first trip to the Rose Bowl was great. The setting is beautiful - the mountains, the neighborhood, the city of Pasadena - just a really cool place to visit."
6614,Date of experience: January 2014,9-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,WOW WOW WOW Go Noles!,I was there for the BCS Championship and what a great place for a game. The classic stadium was amazing. It's not new with all kinds of neon and what not.....it's PERFECT. The setting is unbelievable. The entire experience was one few are fortunate to have- to watch their team win the final BCS championship in such a location.
6615,Date of experience: January 2014,9-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,1,Old and poorly operated,We were at the National Championship game this week and the Rose Bowl stadium is beautiful but outdated and not functional for such a large crowd. If you went to the bathroom at any time you had to wait 20+ minutes and then after you were done you had to wait at the tunnel entrance for 40+ minutes......This stadium should not be used for such large games as it is totally not capable of handling the crowds....And I wish they didn't serve alcohol at a college game....crazy drunk people everywhere.
6616,Date of experience: January 2014,9-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,2,Rose Bowl Stadium Overrated and Antiquated,"I just returned from the BCS National Championship game in Pasadena at the Rose Bowl Stadium.  The game was great!  The venue, however was very disappointing.  Classic by design and full of history, the stadium does not even come close to what football fans are used to today.  Seats are VERY close together and uncomfortable. Concessions are not convenient to the seats, the restrooms are very old and bad by modern standards.  The tunnels leading into the stadium are narrow and steps are difficult to navigate - no railings.  It takes forever to leave your seat, either go to the restroom and go to concessions and return.  One more thing....the venue is very scary.  The tunnels are so narrow that if there were some sort of panic (earthquake or other evacuation requirement), there would be no way to exit in a reasonable time. Enjoy the history, but that's all you will enjoy!"
6617,Date of experience: January 2014,8-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,"Great Football Experience, College Football Mecca","I visited the Rose Bowl for Auburn's national championship game on January 6th, 2014. Although the game did not turn out how I would have liked (Auburn lost 34-31), the stadium was fantastic. I was seated in section 20, row 60. We had a great view of both scoreboards, the mountains in the background and the field. One difficulty we ran in to was getting around the outside of the stadium. We attempted to enter about an hour before kickoff and had to traverse several bridges plus thousands of people to get in. The other critique I heard is the tunnels can become packed if many people leave the section at one time. I did not experience this and my friends went to the bathroom before halftime and didn't encounter too much crowd, but it was a critique we heard. I had a great time visiting this hallowed ground of college football, and hope to see an Auburn victory in the future."
6619,Date of experience: January 2014,8-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Florida State Reigns in the Rose Bowl Stadium,"What an awesome place to watch first class college football! Beautiful area, tailgating on a grassy, tree lined golf course, great comfortable seats with backs and arm rests, gorgeous green grass on field."
6620,Date of experience: January 2014,7-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Fan Festival,January 1st was the day.  Beautiful and Sunny in Pasadena.  I did not enter the stadium but participated in the Pre game festivities which were outside of the Stadium near disabled parking lot.  I arrived early and left early so it was easy getting and and a breeze getting out.  Be prepared for $$$$$ parking.  It cost me $40.  Since there was estimated  of 800k people for the parade I expected more confusion but everything was fine.  I would go again.
6621,Date of experience: January 2014,7-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Heaven on earth for college football fans!,This is the Mecca of college football and it did not disappoint.  Pasadena and the Rose Bowl have the logistics for this game down to a science.  Can't wait to make a return visit.
6622,Date of experience: January 2014,7-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Fabulous Rose Bowl Experience,"The excitement and thrill of attending the 100th Rose Bowl game cannot be overstated.  Wonderful visiting fans from the ""Green and White"" joined those from Stanford in a celebration of all that a championship college football game could and should be.  Marching bands, cheerleaders, rooting sections and the happy crowd made the occasion joyous. The site is historical and beautiful and the Pasadena weather this day was Chamber of Commerce perfect.  If you are a collegiate football fan, come to Southern California for New Years and make this a ""bucket list"" item on your agenda.  The expected ""fly-over"" was missed and the only negative this glorious day."
6623,Date of experience: January 2014,7-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Perfect Place for a Game!,We went to the Rose Bowl and saw a terrific game. The staff throughout the stadium area were cordial and helpful. Great experience for our family!
6624,Date of experience: January 2014,7-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Spartan's were victorious,"Nice facility and clean.  It is not a modern stadium, built yesterday obviously, but that is part of the history and charm.  Bathrooms were clean and moved pretty quickly.  Lots of concession stands and never had to wait more than 2-3 people in line for food or beer.  The 100th Rose Bowl Game, it doesn't get any better than that!"
6626,Date of experience: January 2014,7-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Loss :(,"Stanford lost against Michigan State. The stadium was beautiful (as always) and clean. Finding the parking lot our car was in was extremely difficult for a very short person since all sorts of large trucks were parked around the lots and it was VERY dark, but finally a very nice Limo driver gave me a map and said ""walk between the trucks"" and LO land BEHOLD, there was the right lot with the car and all the other passengers. I think my problem, aside from the trucks, was that I had previously twice entered the Rose Bowl from the front and this time the friends driving us took the back road through a nice part of Pasadena. It did make finding things in the dark difficult though. Lost to Michigan State."
6627,Date of experience: January 2014,7-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Fantastic Experience,"For the past two years, my alma mater has been a participant in the Granddaddy Of Them All, the Rose Bowl football game. I just want to compliment the organizers, who make the game a fantastic experience for the fans. How? Any number of ways...Where else will you find temperatures in the 70's on New Year's Day?The volunteers are everywhere, dressed in their bright yellow vests, to assist the fans and guests. They smile, they're helpful, and they wish everyone a Happy New Year.The vendors are friendly and accommodating.The stadium has undergone a complete renovation in the past two years and is gleaming, majestic, beautiful.About the only negative is that the parking situation leaves a lot to be desired, but since the venue is over a hundred years old, we'll give them a pass on that."
6629,Date of experience: January 2014,7-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,1,Awful,This is the most awful stadium I have ever been in. If my team ever plays in the rose bowl again I will not attend. The way they manage crowds is horrible. You could wait in line for over 2 hours just to get in to the stadium. And leaving the stadium is even more of a hassle. Overall I did not have a good experience at the rose bowl.
6630,Date of experience: January 2014,5-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,3,In need of upgrades,"On our recent trip to the Rose Bowl, we found conditions lacking.  The seats were cramped and just metal benches.  The score boards flickered and there was only one large Jumbo torn at the north end zone, so we had to keep turning around to see highlights etc.  The concessions were poor, county fair food at best.  Not a proper food concourse.  Beer was expensive and many fans had too much and were unruly.  In our section alone at least 10 people were taken out by security.  The bathrooms were clean though and the ushers very professional.  This stadium was built in 1920 and it looks.  Was expecting a little more from such an iconic stadium."
6631,Date of experience: January 2014,5-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Rose Bowl game,"We had a great time cheering the Michigan State Spartans to victory over Stanford in the 100th Rose Bowl game.  The stadium is very clean and had many bathroom facilities available.  We had end zone tickets, so we had to look at the jumbo-tron to see action on the opposite side of the field.  We were in the north end zone (same side as jumbo-tron) so we had to turn around to see some of the action.  If you are lucky enough to have a choice as to where you sit, it would be better to sit along the side lines.The atmosphere during the game was awesome!  Lots of energy from the fans.There were a number of food and merchandise vendors on the stadium grounds before the game.  Many of the merchandise vendors were sold out of MSU items before the game, but we were able to find a vendor inside the stadium before the game began.We purchased a general parking pass with our tickets and it was worth it.  To get to our parking area, we just followed the directions on the parking pass.  We also attended the Rose Parade, so we arrived at the parking area by 6:00am.  There were no issues with traffic at this time of day.  It was very convenient to have the car on the stadium grounds.Be prepared to wait in traffic when you leave the game.  Also, bring snacks and something to drink to leave in the car.  You will want something to eat and drink as you wait in traffic.  There isn't anywhere to stop along the way so plan ahead.If your team makes the Rose Bowl, you should definitely go!"
6632,Date of experience: January 2014,5-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Find your seat early!,"My husband and I were there for this year's Rose Bowl game.   We wandered around outside the stadium a bit too long, and got caught up in the crowds trying to enter the tunnel, mixed in with the crowds trying to go in another direction to get beer/use restrooms/get food/etc.   The Rose Bowl's tunnels are narrow, as this is an older stadium.   Even after we got past the cross-traffic, we were in a body-to-body bottleneck of people waiting to enter the tunnel.   Security had to allow only so many people in at a time, then wait for the tunnel to clear before the next batch could go.  The crowd itself felt very claustrophobic.   Once inside, of course, the stadium was great.  Only improvement I could suggest would be a large replay screen on the south end, to supplement the one and only screen at the north end.  If you're anywhere in the north endzone area, you'll have to turn around to see replays."
6633,Date of experience: January 2014,4-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Love this place!,"We came to see Michigan State beat Stanford and we were so impressed with how well-run every aspect of the experience was. Concessions, bathrooms, attendants, etc.  it it old but SO BEAUTIFUL.  Sections 16-22 are good for  being in the shade with view if jumbotron."
6634,Date of experience: January 2014,4-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,"If your team is there, you should come","It was on the bucket list, so when MSU made it, we booked our flight. Next time, we will tivo the Rose Parade and have more time at the tailgate.  It was euphoric being in the stadium I had seen on TV for many years. It is very walkable from the parade, if you also include the Metro. If you do, PRE PAY FOR YOUR METRO TICKET. Everyone on the planet will be walking with you, so jump ahead of the massive line to buy the Metro ticket, with a pre paid ticket!!!! There is a beer/wine store just across from the Metro, if you need to imbibe at the tailgate. We walked from Pasadena City College. I had heard the lines in the stadium were horrible. We did not find any lines, people were riveted to their seats. Hot dogs started at $6 and double beers at $13. Basically what we find at all stadiums. There is a shuttle at one point to take you from the Metro, the line for that was waaaaay too long, so we walked. It was a very nice 30 minute walk. People said later the shuttle line was long but moved quickly.Lots of shopping along the route. After the game, all went on sale, so waiting is not a bad plan, since you don't want to hold all those souvenirs during the game."
6636,Date of experience: January 2014,3-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,4,"Classic Stadium, memorable football add to your bucket list",The stadium is much improved in that seats with backs have replaced the bleachers of the 70's when we first attended Rose Bowl Games on New Years Day.  The atmosphere makes up for the lack of big screens and the ideal Southern California climate makes for a marvelous New Year.  The opportunity to view the floats the day before the parade around the grounds is an excellent chance to see the artistry of the floats and to interact with the designers.  Great party environment on game day.
6637,Date of experience: January 2014,3-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Very happy MSU won but...,"I have NEVER seen a more unorganized stadium as this one.  *Massive crush of people all trying to get to their gate (and tripping over the portable line stanchions sticking out in travel lanes) *very disappointing food choices (not one vegetarian/vegan offering) *stupid policy of no bottle tops/unopened beer cans allowed (resulting in spills all over my clothing and flat drinks after a few minutes)*2.5 hour wait for shuttles back to Parsons lot after the game - lines forming left and right and meandering all over the place and yet not going anywhereVery glad State won, but the rest of the experience was a disaster."
6638,Date of experience: January 2014,3-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,1,"Great setting, horse & buggy access","The Rose Bowl is a classic and should be experienced at least once.  Pasadena is horrible for large crowds.  Aside from the freeways, access through the town and to the stadium hasn't changed much since the automobile was invented.  Plan on spending more time waiting in the car or on the bus than attending the parade or game.  Until Pasadena figures out mass transit getting to the Rose Bowl is a joke."
6639,Date of experience: November 2013,3-Dec-13,Big Ten,UCLA,4,"""Would a rose by any other name......""","I wish there was a 4.5 rating.  That's what I would give it.  I attended the Washington/UCLA game on 11/15/13 and am very glad that I went.  Was in town for another event in Pasadena and did not want to miss the opportunity.  Bought a general admission ticket and saw the 2nd & 3rd qtrs.  I knew the place was enormous but never thought I was as far away from the field as I had figured to be.  Yes, u are not close but you're not a mile away, either.  It's a fantastic setting that reminds you a lot of The Cotton Bowl/Texas State Fairgrounds.  You walk in then there is this huge festival vending area that goes all around the stadium.  And there is always a giant crowd out there that doesn't care about he game!!  VENDORS EVERYWHERE!!!  Only drawback is that it's not an on-campus stadium.  But it is definitely a unique experience unto itself.  I highly recommend it!"
6640,Date of experience: November 2013,25-Nov-13,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Game day,"Rose Bowl is a wonderful California tradition but the stadium only has 1 large screen at one end of stadium. We were the visiting team and our seats were Ok, but had to turn around behind us every time we wanted to see the play at the opposite end of field. The city did a great job of Shuttle Bus but after game had to walk nearly a mile to get back to end of line to turn around and go back to get on bus. Took Total walking time to get to end of line and back to bus was about 45 minutes. But with that many people is was not bad."
6641,Date of experience: November 2013,23-Nov-13,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Walk to End Epilepsy,Rose Bowl staff were great and very helpful with this event. There were over 3000 people in attendance and everything executed perfectly.
6642,Date of experience: November 2013,18-Nov-13,Big Ten,UCLA,4,UCLA FOOTBALL EXPERIENCE,"Attended 11.15.13 game versus Washington.The Stadium is a jewel and is in progress of upgrading all amenities. The 1 thing I didn't like about it is that the seating, as you move away from field, moves more away from the field and less upwards than in more modern stadiums. As a result you could be further away from the field on the 50 yard line than you'd be in the end zones.I parked my car in downtown Pasedena at Parson's center ($15) and took free shuttle to the Bowl (10 minute ride). NOT RECOMMENDED! Bus driver got lost on way to the Bowl. After the game the line for the shuttle was hundreds, yes hundreds, of yards long with thousands of people in it. Yes, there are many buses and the line moves quickly, but it can take 1-2 hours to get on a bus after the game. Do yourself a favor and park at the Bowl ($25). The traffic flows pretty well out of lots and you're in your car, not standing in a line to get on a bus. Don't understand why anyone would take the bus!If you are a college football fan in general and not specifically a UCLA fan, I'd recommend a USC game at the Coliseum versus UCLA at the Rose Bowl. Why? I did both on consecutive nights recently. USC game at Coliseum was spectacular. The UCLA game was just very good. The Coliseum has wider seats and aisles, seats are closer to field, USC fans more enthusiastic, and the atmosphere is electric. Not same at UCLA game. And the USC band is just so much better.Still, UCLA football at the Rose Bowl is a great experience."
6643,Date of experience: November 2013,10-Nov-13,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Sensory overload but in a good way!,"There is so much to see at the Rose Bowl Flea Market that you're feet will be done before your eyes are. With this event only once a month, thousands come out to enjoy all there is to offer. I think if you are a treasure hunter at heart, you will enjoy the many unique vintage items that you'll never find on your local retail store. If you don't care for shopping, this is definitely not the place for you. It's hot as there is little shade so put on plenty of sunscreen, bring a hat, and good walking shoes. A few bottles of water is also a good idea. It's actually quite hard to see everything in one visit. There's just that much stuff and you can easily get lost.  So once you can get past the $8 price of admission, you'll take a step back into history and know why thousands come. I recommend it at least once in a lifetime."
6644,Date of experience: October 2013,15-Oct-13,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Rose Bowl Flea Mkt.  great! ....,"Every 2nd Sunday of the month there is a flea market with over a thousand vendors.  Visiting from FL, we found this to be one of the largest flea we've been too.  Prices are based on your bargaining skills, so work the vendor till you're happy ... or walk ... your choice!  There is something here for everyone.  Admission price is based on the time you enter.  7am to 8am @ $15 pp; 8am to 9am @ $10 pp; after 9am @ $8 pp.  I believe it's $20 pp, if you wish to enter while the vendors are unloading ( around 5 or 6 am).  Parking is ""free.""  I highly recommend bringing a cart or wagon to carry your new found treasures.  We walked up and down aisles for over 6 hours.  Sun lotion & water are a must.  Hope this is helpful when you decide to come.  Believe me when I say ... this is an all day event!  Have fun!"
6645,Date of experience: January 2013,14-Oct-13,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Not to be missed historical Icon!,"The Rose Bowl is located in the basin of a park and surrounded by lush greenery and of course, rose bushes. It is a great place to walk, have a picnic, sightsee...and you do not even realize you are just outside a huge metropolitan area. Do not miss this wonderful part of Pasadena!"

If you are a true treasure hunter or thrifter, this is a must stop.  Just plan to spend the whole day because this place is HUGE.  You will find everything you can thing of for bargain (and not-so-bargain) price.  Half the fun is the haggling and negotiating. Some things you may find include: antique paintings, dishes, wine sets, decanters and furniture, car parts, dresses, keys, tools, chandeliers, clothing, doors, yard ornaments, pieces of Hollywood sets, home decor, etc."
6650,Date of experience: September 2013,8-Sep-13,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Rose Bowl Flea Market - 2nd Sunday of the Month,"This market is huge & you can find anything and everything. Wear very comfortable shoes. You'll be walking a lot. The booths around the periphery of the stadium typically are new things. Head two sections away over a bridge and this will be the quietest section. This is the best area to hunt for wearables...clothes, shoes & handbags. I found some good copper trinkets out there today....definitely not clothes. So, if you have time walk everywhere. The central section is enormous. You'll find all sorts of bric a brac and furniture. Want ""Pyrex"", there is plenty. Today I found some amazing vintage greeting cards. Bring a water bottle with you. Water purchased inside the market is outrageous at $3 and $5. On a hot day consider bringing an umbrella for protection. Parking is free. However there is an admission fee. After 9am, it is $8.00 to get in. Want to scope things out earlier? The entrance fee is more. This is a great way to spend a Sunday morning if you like hunting for old treasures."

6652,Date of experience: August 2013,26-Aug-13,Big Ten,UCLA,4,2nd Sunday Flea Market at Rose Bowl,"On our trip from Thousand Oaks to LV we made an early Sunday morning stop at the once monthly Flea market that had been seen several times on HGTV. Very nice layout with Collectables in one section, newer things in another all layed out on a free map givin to us upon entering. Prices seemed reasonable and being this being on the West Coast there seemed to be a great diverse supply of things to look at and buy if you chose to. We seen a good portion in 2 1/2 hrs and we skipped through a few sections ( T-shirts,etc)"

6654,Date of experience: August 2013,12-Aug-13,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Rose Bowl Swap Meet,"This is the mother of all swap meets so be ready with your good walking shoes. You can go inearly (before 9) for bit more entrance fee, if you are moving quickly through and want to swoopup bargains before the crowds. Do yourself a favor and bring a wagon or pull cart to transportyour treasures. The isles are wide enough to accommodate your wheeled carrier. The antique section is the most popular and you will find treasures from 70 retro sheik furniture to rustic antique finds. Bring along a pad for taking notes to return to favorite booth or item, as the place is so big that you may never find your way back to re-visit a potential purchase. Items do comedown in price as they day goes along, so bargains can be had at the 11th hour. The stadium does have ample restroom facilities (close to actual stadium), as well as food area near the front of the arena. Here you will find a mix of food and drink options along with shaded picnictables to rest your tired feet. Go to this event with some patience and a sense of humor, as itis a great people watching spot along with an amazing variety of items to take home."
6661,Date of experience: January 2013,25-Jul-13,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Rose Bowl Game,"I was surprise how few amenities the stadium was lacking.  the bathrooms are old with alot of porta potties.  We had great seats for the game, but the stadium needs refurbishing.  I was also surprise that the stadium lacks esculators and elevators for persons with disabilities and accessibility for seniors.  Overall, we had a great football game Wisconsin vs Stanford."
6669,Date of experience: October 2012,12-Apr-13,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Grand Old Stadium that is getting a face lift,This is a perfect venue for tailgating.  You get to park on the public golf course (which is right next door.).  Get there about two hours early and you should have no problem setting up camp under a nice shade tree.
6673,Date of experience: November 2012,6-Mar-13,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Tradition Lives On,"Love the way the history is maintained and traditions continue at the World Famous Rose Bowl.  Seats are old style bleachers, but a bleach pad is all you need."

I also use the perimeter as my walking course every night.  There is always a lot of people, the lighting is good and the parking is easy.  Nice couple of miles to be outside and getting some exercise."
6677,Date of experience: January 2013,7-Feb-13,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Good Times...,"Fun walking spot, leading to the Arroyo. The Flea Market is great. There's a swingset, and playground where high-school shenanigans with me and my ""group"" took place.  Make of it what you want: people need to use their imaginations more, anyway!!! ^_^"
6678,Date of experience: January 2013,3-Feb-13,Big Ten,UCLA,4,great view,No matter  where you sat in this stadium you had an a great view of the game not to mention the mountains behind. I was there for the Rose Bowl and everything ran so smoothly. I hope I get to see a game here again some time.

6680,Date of experience: January 2013,31-Jan-13,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Great Place To Hold A Half Marathon,I just finished the half marathon and the location was perfect. There is a very nice running/walking area surrounding it. I was surprised how wide the area was that had been set aside for daily use as a running/walking area. It was fun to say that I crossed the 50 yard line in the Rose Bowl (that was where the finish line was located).
6681,Date of experience: January 2013,29-Jan-13,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Couldn't life without it,"Running around the Rosebowl at 6am is exhilerating.  I've run that Rose Bowl for 15 years and going strong.  Never a problem, I've run as early as 5am and as late as 9pm.  It can get a little intense with scheduled activities, but overall, its the greatest place in Pasadena."
6682,Date of experience: January 2013,23-Jan-13,Big Ten,UCLA,5,"Rose Bowl Game ""Grandaddy of the Them All""","Attended the 2013 Rose Bowl. Spectacular tradition in a grand setting. The stadium, aside from the new press box and and few luxury suites, is old and very slow to get into through the narrow tunnels and outside ""security"". However, the magnitude of the event makes it all worthwhile. Come as early as you can and enjoy the great game."
6683,Date of experience: January 2013,18-Jan-13,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Rose Bowl Game,"With 93,00 people in attendance you would think that this would be overwhelming.  Good News!  This operates like a fine tuned machine.  The stadium, City of Pasadena, and fans make this event so pleasant and special!"
6684,Date of experience: January 2013,12-Jan-13,Big Ten,UCLA,4,We had a Blast,"We went as a family to the Parade first then I took my younger son to the game. It is so much fun. We did not have any issues with finding tickets. I paid under face value. This is a great place to watch a football game. We were looking at the press box and the mountain range behind it. The sun was shinning on us all day. This is a must do if you can. Take the family or go by yourself. not one bad seat in the house, but if your in the end zone, you will seat on a bench. We had reg seats so no issues. I hope you have as much fun as we did."
6685,Date of experience: January 2013,11-Jan-13,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Once in a lifetime experience!,"My husband and I booked our vacation to Cali before we knew Wisconsin had a chance of making it to the Rose Bowl.  Once they had, we decided we wanted to see the game and take our chances with scalpers.  We parked on the golf course behind the stadium to tailgate.  The cost was $40/car and split the cost with friends so it wasn't bad.  We had a great time tailgating with other great fans.  Be prepared to be bombarded with people trying to sell you stuff.  At the stadium, the gates were marked well and didn't take long to find our seats, which were in the student section.  We were standing the entire time with the exception of half time but there was enough room to move around.  The atmosphere is undescribeable and we were so excited to be there.  We got a great deal on our tickets just 15 minutes before the game started.   Depending on who's playing this isn't always recommended but since this was Wisconsin's third appearence in a row, it was easy to get tickets and negotiate prices.  They served beer there but the cost was $10 for a can, obviously to deter people from over-doing it.  I got a hot dog, which tasted good and cost me $5.  I highly recommend going once if your team is playing.  We didn't see the parade or take any tours but had a great time that we will never forget!"
6687,Date of experience: January 2013,5-Jan-13,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Great experience,Went to our first ever bowl game and had a fantastic time. Very easy parking in lot D great per game activities. We went in to the stadium early and had no issues woth lines and were able to go right to our seats. The leg room in the seats are a little tight but It was a wonderful afternoon and a great place to see a game.
6688,Date of experience: January 2013,4-Jan-13,Big Ten,UCLA,2,NO CAMERAS,"We went on a bus right from the Rose Parade, where we'd taken many photos with my new Canon camera and 2 lenses, to the Rose Bowl. They refused to let me in without leaving my camera and both lenses with them! I talked with numerous Security people and a Pasadena PD officer - it is Rose Bowl policy that any camera that can use different lenses is 'professional' and cannot be allowed inside!  My seat was 6 rows from the top of the stadium, row 71, in the end-zone!  I guess they were worried that I'd try to sell a photo taken with my 135mm lens!  When asked, they confirmed that only cell phone and point-and-shoot cameras are allowed.  So be forewarned -- THERE IS NO PLACE THAT THEY TELL YOU THIS IN ADVANCE!  Imagine how many people go from the parade to the Bowl and learn this - although the application of the 'rule' is arbitrary - the woman in front of me had a Nikon with 3 lenses!!  I don't think I'll ever go back to the Rose Bowl."
6689,Date of experience: January 2013,3-Jan-13,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Rose Bowl Game Atmosphere is Awesome!,"We attended the 2013 Rose Bowl game between Wisconsin and Stanford.  We lost again, but had a great time.??	Great atmosphere and spectacle??	Ride the light rail to the Memorial Park station??	Free shuttle rides to the game -- its about a 2 mile walk from the station??	Plan to get to the game early -- a lot of people, plus lots of pre-game festivities going on outside the stadium??	Getting in the stadium area is pretty easy.  Getting to the seats is more challenging.  Long tunnels with lines, and locating your seats??	Unbelievable experience"
6690,Date of experience: December 2012,15-Dec-12,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Great place to spend a Sunday morning.,We went a little later in the morning as we were told it is a little crazy first thing.... We found parking right away and a short walk had us in the middle of the biggest antique/flea market we have ever visited.  Quite a large cross section of stuff from antiques to clothes....worth a visit.
6691,Date of experience: November 2012,30-Nov-12,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Flea Market on 2nd Sundays is Great!,"Held the second Sunday of each month, the giant Rose Bowl Flea Market takes over the outer ring of the stadium, with local and regional vendors selling everything from furniture and artwork to clothing, toys, candles, soap, tools and everything else under the sun. Numerous food vendors are also on site. The normal hours are 9am-3pm but early admission starts at 7 with a small additional entry fee. Parking is ample and free.  One additional treat-attendees are welcome to go inside the famous stadium for a peek and photo opportunity! This Flea Market is well-known in the LA area for great finds and good deals and always draws a big crowd. A great shopping, eating and people-watching experience."
6693,Date of experience: December 2011,26-Oct-12,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Good place for a game,"Get there early, as it is difficult to park.  Better, park at the Norton Simon museum and either take the shuttle or walk.  The stadium is O.K."

6697,Date of experience: September 2012,24-Sep-12,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Amazing venue to see a football game,"Plenty of good seats and lots of amenities. The LA crowd is pretty laid back so no problems at the game with obnoxious fans, etc. Overall a great experience!"
6699,Date of experience: September 2012,11-Sep-12,Big Ten,UCLA,2,Needs to be bulldozed and rebuilt.,I know that it have been around forever and has historic presence.  But really port-a-pottys all the way out in the parking lot.?  To go to the bathroom takes at lease 15 minutes from our seats.  We had to park a mile away on a golf course.  Rude people driving golf carts running elderly people off the path to get through.  Saw one guy that looked like he needed help the driver almost ran him down on the path and did not offer to give him a ride till about 50 people started yelling at him.  I have been to allot of stadiums and this one is the worst.
6700,Date of experience: September 2012,11-Sep-12,Big Ten,UCLA,4,fun flea market,"It's a huge flea market once a month!  DO NOT GO WHEN IT IS HOT!  Not only will you be uncomfortable but the vendors pack up early because a) they are hot and b) no one is buying.  California is famous for great year-round weather so hot, humid weather is very rare. Went with friends on an unusually hot/humid day and EVERYONE was miserable. The flea market is once a month, so there are only 1 or 2 months when you should not go. Other than that - enjoy!  Bring cash.  I swear you will find something from your childhood that will be worth revisiting. Some fun furniture if you are in the market for unique items. Easy to find and plenty of free parking. Wear comfortable shoes and a hat if sun is out."
6703,Date of experience: August 2012,16-Aug-12,Big Ten,UCLA,5,A Historic Place to See,A lot of parking. Every second Sunday they have one of the largest flea markets in the world there. Easy to find.

6721,Date of experience: November 2011,14-Feb-12,Big Ten,UCLA,3,The parking is awful!,"I like the stadium, been there many times for UCLA games, it's nicethat you can tailgate. Bad thing is that if ypu don't tailgate finding your car can prove to be a disaster. This stadium is best enjoyed when you do not park on the premises. There are shuttles that take you up to the stadium for some events, just need to find out where to park, it's usually at the Parsons parking lot in Old Town Pasadena. Getting there is a breeze, leaving is not!"
6724,Date of experience: January 2012,1-Feb-12,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Worth the visit if in the area,"I knew I would be passing through Pasadena so I decided to stop by the Stadium. As a sports enthusiast I found it worth the stop just to see the stadium in person. As many have said, if not going on game day, it is just a stadium, but if it is close by on a trip It's neat to see for any sports fan. The location is right of Interstate 210 so why not stop and snap a picture with this historic stadium. A bonus is it's beautiful location."
6726,Date of experience: January 2012,12-Jan-12,Big Ten,UCLA,4,The Grand daddy,A feeling of Awesome washes over you when enter this place. Its an older stadium and doesn't have all the amenities of the new mega stadiums BUT.. this place is so COOL....
6729,Date of experience: January 2012,6-Jan-12,Big Ten,UCLA,3,What you would expect,"Poor beer selection and very expensive. Food options better than average for a stadium.

6738,Date of experience: August 2010,17-Jan-11,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Real Madrid vs. LA Galaxy,"Totally worth the trip down! i think there was 95k+ fans at this game... the shuttle service was EXTREMELY helpful in handling the large amount of people.  Security was A++++ ... it was a short walk from the Westin to the Parson Building shuttle pick up location... we were at the stadium in a breeze.  Upon leaving the game, there was 100 million shuttle buses to take everyone back to the Parson Building... over all it took less than an hour to get every one loaded up and back, which is amazing since 90% of all attendees took the shuttle!I would definitely come to the Rose Bowl again because of how organized this event was!"
6739,Date of experience: January 2011,10-Jan-11,Big Ten,UCLA,5,The parade is superb and the stadium is neat==but getting around is difficult,"It is difficult to get info on logistics to see the Rose Bowl Parade and the Rose Bowl game so want to share our experience.  First, there are masses of people and public transportation is very limited (we walked nearly all the way to the stadium from the l500 block of Colorado Blvd but did catch a train for part of the way after following hundreds of other people walking who also didn't know where they were going--but it was a happy crowd.)   The motel staff didn't know about buses/shuttles, security staff didn't know--and an earlier phone call to the Rose Bowl yielded info that parking was available but we didn't see any other than a $35 park and ride  (with a mile or more shuttle after you park and people were lined up for blocks for the shuttle.)  There could be better info on transportation but it can be done without paying for the package deals if you don't mind some walking.We stayed at a no-frills motel on Colo Blvd (Westways Inn) about half way in the parade route and got parade tickets ahead of time from sharp seating which were located  a half block from the motel  (great seats.)  The hotel which is going to become  a Howard Johnson's this month was $200 a night--if you call 6 mos ahead you might get a street side room which runs $800 for 3 nights.  Downtown Pasadena would be a better location to get to the stadium but don't think there are hotels right on the parade route and they are likely more expensive.  Grandstand parade tickets are $75 each which includes visiting the floats the next day--strongly recommended!The Parade:  It is terrific and visiting the floats afterward is a must!  One of the interesting things was to see the people camped out the day before--totally covering the sidewalks of Colorado Blvd.  People had mattresses, sleeping bags, heaters, fires, food, games and a fun attitude--many do this every year--and it was cold!  One man who had 2 large heaters restaurant-style, said he could stay in a hotel but would miss out on the party.  A large group of young people from a church were preparing gallons of hot chocolate to be given out at midnight.  It was a festive atmosphere and included children of all ages.  No one seemed concerned about the dropping temperatures.  Interestingly, the after-mess--and it was huge after the parade--was totally cleaned up by the following day.The Rose Bowl: the stadium is neat and easy to navigate once there.  It is older and seems small but holds l00,000 people.  Lots of bathrooms and helpful people.  (It would have been better if Wisconsin had won, however.)  You need to leave for the stadium soon after the parade since it takes awhile to get there.A real highlight is visiting the floats the next day  (You can do this for $l0 if you don't get parade grandstand tickets.)  The floats are unbelievable.  Thousands attend this too so be prepared to park and walk blocks.   There are some shuttles  but, again, getting info is not easy.  Old Pasadena is a nice surprise--downtown has many restaurants/bars  and high-end stores all in a 2-3 block area.  There is a real party atmosphere after the game, of course.   All in all, it is worth the trip and can be done without a package deal--tho that would likely  make it easier.   One thing--be prepared for cool weather tho game day was beautiful in the afternoon.  (But the next day it rained all day so we were lucky.)"
6740,Date of experience: January 2011,5-Jan-11,Big Ten,UCLA,2,Dumpiest stadium I've ever been in,"We went to the 2011 Rose Bowl, and while the game itself was awesome, and the event was a once-in-a-lifetime experience I would not miss, the Rose Bowl stadium itself is the dumpiest stadium I have ever been in.  Bring your walking shoes because parking is horrendous, and expensive (really, $40 to park?!?  That's more than we paid for the Fiesta Bowl last year!), and you still hike forever and a day to get there.  The flow of people around and into the stadium is nonexistant, bathroom facilities are subpar, and the seats are old and uncomfortable.  There are hardly any food/beverage vendors selling items in the stands, and due to the limited concession stands, you'll miss huge chunks of the game if you go down to get a drink or something to eat.  There is only one video board, so if you're sitting right under it, have fun twisting your neck around to see any replays.  All in all, one of the worst football stadiums I've been to - the Rose Bowl needs a new home, or to seriously upgrade their facilities."
6780,Date of experience: December 2022,3-Jan-23,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Two times Olympiad Venue,"Not everyday you can walk into a two times Olympiad venue. But thanks to Richard, front gate opens and it was pretty much a private viewing of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The 1920's construction style is certainly imposing. The great entrance flanked with the stones from Coliseum Rome and Altis Olympia Greece. The placards of the Olympians of the 1932 and 1984 Games. It's all history. Don't forget this is also home of Super Bowl, NFL, MLB, USC and a memorial to Los Angeles veterans of World War I.But it will become a 3 times venue in 2028 when the Games return."
6781,Date of experience: September 2022,25-Nov-22,Big Ten,UCLA,5,The grand old Coliseum,"The Coliseum is a huge and legendary venue, home to two Olympics, two Super Bowls, and a number of other historic sporting events. I hadn't been there in many years, so when I went to see the USC-Fresno State game this season, I was pleasantly surprised with the many recent renovations. It is still very much a classic stadium, but the seats, sound system, and jumbotrons are all new. Parking can be difficult and expensive, but you can easily take the Metro E Line to the Expo Park/USC station. From there it's a quick and safe walk to the Coliseum. Overall, a great place to see a football game."
6783,Date of experience: September 2021,19-Sep-21,Big Ten,UCLA,4,A historic venue,"We attended a USC football game.  We purchased on campus parking through a link on the USC website - a short walk to the stadium.  The food concessions were limited.  Although hot dogs were listed on the menu at two stands that I visited, neither had a hot dog."
6784,Date of experience: October 2019,11-Feb-20,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Saints Game,"Even though we lost the game and our QB, we really enjoyed the atmosphere.

6785,Date of experience: November 2019,4-Jan-20,Big Ten,UCLA,5,"And so, to Inglewood...","It??s probably the last time I will see the Rams at their original home. At the end of 2020 they move to play at their brand new multi-billion dollar home in Inglewood. Where the sound of ??Whose house is this...? RAMS HOUSE!!!?? will be a chant that makes absolute sense. Built as a memorial to veterans of the First World War in 1921; it will get the opportunity to do what it was designed to one more time in 2028... to host a Summer Olympics. I went along on a beautiful LA Winter??s evening to see the Rams take on the Ravens. Not the result we hoped for. The Ravens looked unstoppable all evening and the Rams were effectively out of play off contention by the end of the evening. But the atmosphere was superb nevertheless and the $14 cans of beer were being washed down in healthy quantities before those cans are recycled and turned into RSJ joints for Inglewood??s new retractable root. Los Angeles Tycoonary at it??s beautiful, lovely, American Dream best. Everyone coming together with smiles on their faces to see a quality of show that only Americans know how to host. Aloe Blacc put on a superb half time show and despite the result already sliding away; the crowd were on the feet with premium beer in hand. The chilli dogs were superb and made out of pure premium 100% beef. They were half the price of the can of beer so I guess everything evened itself out... apart from Jared Goff still hasn??t married me. See you in Inglewood... shout it loud and proud: ??RAMS HOUSE!!??... Howay the Lads and we are Geordies!! See you soon Los Angeles or should I say (Geordie Shore)..."

6787,Date of experience: November 2019,13-Dec-19,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Historic stadium,"You can take the light rail to USC and walk a few minutes to the stadium, best way to avoid cost of parking and traffic.  The walk takes you past the rose garden, so you might want to plan to get there before your event for a few photo ops.  There are few stadiums that have weathered the test of time and this is one of them.  I hope it stays in tact for many years to come even if it isn't the best stadium for viewing football (avoid corner near the torch)."

(Home loss 6-45!)We came early to the stadium and enjoyed the Fanzone events. Several food trucks to choose from.Different activities to try, until Gates open.Inside stadium - it is huge.To us a great experience.We parked our car next to Metro La Cienega / Jefferson, at a Parking House. $3,- for 24 hours.Going With Metro, cost was $3,5 plus $2,- for buying the TAP card.Some que when going back, but in all it went as expected."

Good screens, great presentation and traditions i.e. lighting of the torch, etc. Of course the USC traditions played out during the game are wonderful. Selling alcohol only in the Clubs has two bad effects - 1. people are not in their seats and that takes away from the experience and support of the teams and 2. when half time is there, the clubs are so crowded that good service is difficult."
6793,Date of experience: October 2019,20-Oct-19,Big Ten,UCLA,4,USC Game,I checked out my first college football game on Saturday night and it was awesome! Such a cool stadium with a lot of history.
6794,Date of experience: September 2019,22-Sep-19,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Rams Game!!,This was our first time to the Coliseum. Went to see the LA Rams. It was great to see the history of the Coliseum and to know that the Summer Olympics and Superbowl was once held here. I think any seat in the Coliseum would be a good seat. We were in 312 and was able to see everything just fine.
6795,Date of experience: October 2018,12-Aug-19,Big Ten,UCLA,5,"Great Stadium, parking can be tough","Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is one of the greatest sporting venues on the planet, twice hosting the Summer Olympics, Superbowls, USC, UCLA, Raiders, Rams and more. Parking can be a challenge."
6797,Date of experience: November 2018,26-Mar-19,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Rams game,"Good to have the Rams back in LA. The Coliseum sight lines are good along the sidelines, but too recessed near and behind the end zones. Results in a cavernous feeling and sounds. Hope the new stadium helps. All the construction for USC game improvement will help once done, but was a negative for our Nov game."
6799,Date of experience: January 2019,30-Jan-19,Big Ten,UCLA,5,City of Angels,"Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, arguably the greatest sports venue in the history of professional sports.  The Coliseum has hosted major events such as the 1932 Olympics, 1984 Olympics, 1959 World Series, Super Bowl 1, Super Bowl 7, etc.  The stadium was previously home to the Los Angeles Dodgers, before Dodger Stadium, the Los Angeles Raiders, the Rams before moving to St Louis, and the San Diego Chargers.  Today, it's the current home of the Rams and most importantly the USC Trojans.   People complain that the stadium is old.  Well, of course, it's old; it opened May 1, 1923."
6800,Date of experience: December 2018,27-Jan-19,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Iconic location for football,"My first NFL game and a great place to start. Sure it's a bit dilapidated and amenities are basic and functional but there's a real atmosphere in the open air with the olympic rings and torch towering over proceedings. Views from most seats were good despite some renovation/modernisation going on. The Rams were excellent too, dominating the 49ers on their way to a Super Bowl appearance. It's not modern but it's got character and atmosphere in spades."
6801,Date of experience: December 2018,14-Jan-19,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Great NFL venue,"Saw the Phil. Eagles kick the local LA Rams butts here mid december. Good venue for viewing, cannot compare as have been to any other NFL/AFL venues.Enjoyed the whole pre / during and after game atmosphere. Plenty action outside stadium little own in it. Great experience, had great seats fairly high up amongst both Eagles & Rams supporters. Would def. go again . Like all major sports venue""s venues globally - food is always average."
6802,Date of experience: September 2018,13-Jan-19,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Great historic place to see a game!,We love that it's not a super modern over the top new thing! Love the old school feel and vibe! Come down and feel the history!
6803,Date of experience: December 2018,10-Jan-19,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Rams vs 49ers,"Great visit to the historic old stadium for my 1st live NFL Game in America. Parked 15 mins away in a residential street (free parking) and was an easy walk in ($5 UBER back after game as not safest area after dark and alone).On arrival I experienced the tailgate outside the stadium and the Rams Fan Zone , both excellent.On entering the stadium I was contacted by someone in the Rams media team who had noticed I had arrived from Australia for the game. They met me and presented me with a t-shirt and other merch which was a great gesture.The game itself was great, the seat was amazing with an unreal view of the mountains and the City skyline in the distance."
6805,Date of experience: December 2018,24-Dec-18,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Eagles vs Rams 2018,"Despite being an obvious fan of the visiting team, Coliseum staff were helpful, friendly and welcoming of all the visitors to their venue. I only give it 4 stars brcause the bleacher seating is in bad need of updating. Other than that - a great experience! (Of course it was icing onvthe cake that my Philadelphia Eagles won that game. :-)"
6806,Date of experience: November 2018,3-Dec-18,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Good Venue    Notre Dame vs USC,"Attended the Notre Dame/USC game and had a great time.  Lots of parking available somewhat near the stadium.  We enjoyed walking through the various tail gate parties.  Most fans were very friendly.  Our seats were toward the ""band"" end zone on the visitors side.  Lots of construction but nothing to stop enjoyment of the game.  Our seats were nearly in the center of the row but most people were polite about going out.  Sight lines were very good and the jumbo screens were good for replays and other displays.  Leaving was a bit crowded but not too bad.  There were lots of food choices available."
6807,Date of experience: November 2018,26-Nov-18,Big Ten,UCLA,4,LA Rams vs Seattle Seahawks,1st visit to this iconic stadium. Used metro return from DTLA with no problems. So much history attached to the venue - Carl Lewis winning four gold medals at the 84' Summer Olympics is a strong memory.The seats are showing their age & are quite narrow but as with most NFL/NBA live viewing there is a lot of time spent on your feet anyway.There was a large crowd in attendance who saw the Rams win in a really close match. Despite the amount of people we were able to return to DTLA quickly via express metro busesIt was the 1st live NFL match for my son & I  & we loved every second of it!
6808,Date of experience: November 2018,12-Nov-18,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Attended Seahawks vs LA Rams game,"attended Seahawks vs Rams game. Enjoyed pretty much except you have hand your hand bags to a storage unit. It is not the most modern staduim, but majestic enough that you can appreciate its existence and history.  Remainded more of a college football type of atmosphere.  One of the most. Moving People staduim ever been to. Half of the viewers were eating during first 3 qtr of the game. I liked that the event staff were very friendly, professional and smooth. I liked that the coliseum is almost near downtown LA. Today was a nice day."
6809,Date of experience: October 2018,4-Nov-18,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Great Venue,"This place is huge and old.  There is some renovating going on and to host an NFL game with the PACKERS in town is a huge undertaking.  The wait for the bathrooms was long, and the food and beer wait was even longer.  We ended up not purchasing any food or beverage because we came to see the game, not wait in line. The stadium is great for football, very similar to Lambeau.  I do love old architecture and the history of the building.  The rose garden outside the gates is beautiful. The RAMS fans sitting in our area were quite friendly during the entire game. There were even a couple RAMS fans that helped one of our group up the steps who needed assistance (double knee replacement). All in all, a very nice experience."
6810,Date of experience: October 2018,29-Oct-18,Big Ten,UCLA,1,Wow.... so bad!,This coliseum should have been torn down decades ago.  Not only is it just in really poor condition but trying to attend a NFL game here was excruciating!  We waited almost an hour trying to get in (thinking that getting there 30 min early would get us through the gates in time for kickoff). So unorganized and way too few gates/entrances. This will be the first and last time I come here for a game.
6811,Date of experience: October 2018,29-Oct-18,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Don??t make them like this anymore!,"Came to the packers-rams game for the history and to see my favourite team, The Packers. The sourronding area is not the cleanest and if you drive to a game expect to pay between $50 and $100 to park. The local policy do a fair job closing roads and guiding people out but it would still take an hour depending on where you park. The venue itself allows you to enter on 2 levels and stairs are very steep. They currently have construction under way to improve the stadium for upcoming summer olympics?If you go, take transit, metro line Blue. Try to get a ticket on the south side, not facing the sun. Get seats lower tan row 65, makes for less stair climbing. Seats and rows are narrow, watch your step."
6812,Date of experience: September 2018,21-Oct-18,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Iconic But....,"It is iconic to visit knowing the history that has occurred at the Coliseum It was need to see the torch lit during the Vikings and Rams game. The tailgate area was very good and had a good mix of entertainment and food. It also has some great historical memoirs and plaquesNow the but...Concessions were expensive (like the food truck ideas) but that still didn't stop people from purchasing too much beer. Security was completely lax as people were smoking swearing and toking in the stands and if you can't smell it as a security then you must not have smell senses. Parking is limited and expensive so I recommend taking transit, The seats are old and thank goodness I won a seat pad at the tailgate.Still great to be at a game site with so much history just brace yourself for some of the distractions."
6813,Date of experience: October 2018,14-Oct-18,Big Ten,UCLA,4,The Real Deal,"This is the way to experience college football (at NFL prices). Seating 93,000 people, USC puts on quite a show... by the players, the marching band, the cheerleaders, the announcers, & the crowds complete, with fireworks. Just eat before you arrive - a bottled water is $5 & a slice of pizza is $9."
6814,Date of experience: September 2018,10-Oct-18,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Great stadium to see a game,First time attending a game here. Went to the Vikings/Rams game and had a great time. Food and beer are a bit pricey but very good - get an LA Street Dog. Not really a bad seat in the house. Rams fans were great and heckled us Vikes fans with humor. Only complaint is getting out of stadium. It was packed and took longer to leave than expected. But it was a nice night so didn't really bother us. Hope to go back to catch a USC game.
6815,Date of experience: September 2018,5-Oct-18,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Thursday Night Rams vs Vikings!,"Been a Rams fan My whole life. Remember my early years rooting for Merlin Olsen, Jack Youngblood, Jack Snow and Roman Gabriel just to name a few. Had the pleasure of watching the Rams play in the Colisium for the first and last time. Being from South Jersey I wanted to take advantage of them playing back in the Colisium like when I was a kid. They didn't disappoint. Man what a game. Goff, Gurley, Kupp, Woods and Cooks look unstoppable. Donald, Suh and Peters on defense. Are you kidding me. It's a dream come true. Thanks Goff for a five touchdown night and sending those stinking Vikings & their obnoxious fans packing. So glad I got to see the Colisium. Looking forward to the new stadium in the near future. Go Rams! Going to being Super Bowl Champs once again!"
6816,Date of experience: September 2018,3-Oct-18,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Rams vs Vikings,Had a great time watching the game with my son.  First time there didnt remember but when I saw the torch I remembered the Olympics were held there when I was a kid
6818,Date of experience: September 2018,28-Sep-18,Big Ten,UCLA,3,NFL game,We came here for the Rams/Vikings game. The good... such a cool experience to sit in a stadium that hosted the Olympics.Cool area with a ton of food trucks (only reason we found it was we had to walk around the entire place to find seats) A good close football game we had upper seats but really has a nice view of the game(section 13)The badIt's old and dingy people throw half eaten food everywhere its like land minesBeer good grief 15 to 17 for a beer unless you want Bud light can for 10Weed not supposed to smoke but it was everywhere and people just smoke it when the security people leave.There was no control over the drunk people rude with loud horns blowing them in you ear (why in the heck are you allowed to bring those in!!!)Getting in was a joke like herding cattle(no like people actually were mooing)Parking...  Oh boy 100 buck right by the stadium and a few blocks to park in someone's yard 40!With such a cool part of history it's shame people treat it like a pigpen
6819,Date of experience: September 2018,28-Sep-18,Big Ten,UCLA,2,Rams vs. Vikings,"Took the bus from Echo Park to the Coliseum. It??s the 200 line if anyone wants to know.The traffic was so bad we hopped off about a mile from drop off.  TRAFFIC.. was a mess. Even though we chose to take a bus hoping to avoid the stand still of traffic it was still a nightmare.I would recommend getting there early to avoid the stress of traffic.Once we got to the gates to enter it was pure chaos. Nobody helping direct traffic or lines or keeping things civil . We missed the first part of the game because it was so chaotic trying to get in.Do not show up with anything that isn??t a clear bag. They won??t accept backpacks, purses ,etc. put everything in a clear bag.Also, if you are a e-cig user they will ask you to check it in down somewhere at other gate or toss it . We went to our seats and proceeded to watch people get so inebriated it was hard to focus on the game. Why aren??t the people trained selling beers for $17 a can noticing when someone is over the limit? People standing in front of us and then we have to stand because we couldn??t see the game. It was a circus.After the game we stayed till it cleared out since it was a stampede .The game was great and Rams won..I??d rather watch it on TV rather then go thru what the Coliseum had to offer.Disappointed venue."
6820,Date of experience: September 2018,28-Sep-18,Big Ten,UCLA,1,Horrible experience,"Horrible place. Visited for an NFL game last night. Queues were awful getting in but you almost expect that from any sporting event. Prices for drinks and food etc also very expensive but also to be expected. Also make sure you check out the bag rules in advance. When we eventually got in someone was sat in our seat so we couldn??t see the seat numbers. People were telling us to ??get out the way??. It felt very hostile from the beginning. Asked a steward to help us find our seat who then had to ask the person to move. Someone proceeded to jump down over the chairs next to us and threaten us telling us if we needed someone to move we should have asked them, which we would have done if we knew it was our seat. He got right in my husband??s face asking him if he wanted to fight. We decided to leave after not even 5 minutes of the game. Such a horrible and disappointing experience. Maybe we just got seats in the wrong place."
6821,Date of experience: September 2018,28-Sep-18,Big Ten,UCLA,1,Horrible and Expensive,"What a shame that one of my favorite football teams has to play in a dump like this.  Where to start?  Impossible to get to with the LA traffic and no mass transit. Want to park anywhere near or on the stadium grounds, prepare to shell out $75 to $100 just for parking.  Hungry?  Good luck getting anything to eat with the lines (although the food choices looked so pathetic, you??re probably better off skipping that).  Thirsty?  Good luck getting through the lines of foul mouthed drunks to get a $17 can of beer.  The stadium is disgustingly dirty.  Prepare to sit in your car for an hour after the game because the traffic flow exiting is a joke."
6822,Date of experience: September 2018,9-Sep-18,Big Ten,UCLA,2,My first time here....,".......I came for a soccer game. I enjoyed the game but I have to be honest....I am not a fan of the Coliseum. It seems almost 'forgotten,' especially sitting across from LAFC. The seats and aisles are small. I cant even describe how uncomfortablelly small they are - like a 5 hour plane ride on America Airlines small....and it just seems dirty and unkempt"
6823,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Sep-18,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Usc vs UNLV game,Okay the good there is some great food near the new soccer stadium it was excellent a lot of food and drinks there.The coliseum is being renovated so it was difficult to get around but there is so much construction going on.The Coliseum is old and will get better when they finish it but no complaints here because if you are a Usc fan there is no place I would rather be than watching a game there.
6824,Date of experience: August 2018,26-Aug-18,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Very average stadium,"Not best place to watch a game, looks very outdated and needs a lot of work. Food outlets weren??t ready when gates opened seats uncomfortable overall very average"
6825,Date of experience: August 2018,24-Aug-18,Big Ten,UCLA,2,""" It Used To Be Really Good ""","The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is totally shut down, as they are renovating it for the new Los Angeles Rams Team. This is an older stadium with extremely limited parking. It was a hassle trying to figure out where to park, especially since the new soccer stadium is only a block away, and they don't have any parking either. This Coliseum should have been torn down a long time ago and completely re-built. It is an old historic stadium, but time has passed it by ! Good Luck Rams !"
6826,Date of experience: August 2018,18-Aug-18,Big Ten,UCLA,1,Terrible,"Saw the Raiders Rams preseason game. Parking was very difficult to find. Wound up having to pay 60 dollars to park 2 miles away at a gas station. Security screening really slowed things away down. Between the numerous drunk people and those who were openly smiling marijuana is was a bit of a mad house. Very unruly crowd.  Seating was crowded, uncomfortable and people continually stood and held signs in front of us to where we couldn't see the game at all.  Not a good experience at all...."
6827,Date of experience: August 2017,16-Apr-18,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Awesome,Loved it here the only negative was that there didn't seem to be any rubbish bins for the ice cream wrappers and there was a bit of rubbish laying about. I did enjoy it though and rubbish is something that seems to happen at these big attractions
6829,Date of experience: January 2018,4-Mar-18,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Under renovation,They are starting to put it back together again to make it better lots of construction going on in the area .
6830,Date of experience: November 2017,26-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,3,NFL Game Saints@Rams,"Went to the Coliseum last November 26th with my brother-in-law to watch the NFL game. I am an ardent Saints fan, my brother-in-law's favorite team is the Seahawks. The Coliseum has (personal) history on its side: This was actually the second NFL game I saw at the Coliseum. In 1991, the Raiders beat the Niners 12-6...Anyways, as a venue, the Coliseum is highly average. It is rather old and the fold-down seats rather creaky, in some spots there is even rust. Also, it is too big and the atmosphere during games is Cali-like mellow, a far cry from the rocking confines of the Superdome in New Orleans or CenturyLink Field in Seattle. However, we enjoyed a gorgeous late-November afternoon, sunny and around 75F. Getting to and from the Coliseum is a hassle, we used Uber to get there and exited half a mile from the stadium because traffic came to a complete stop. After the game, we walked back to Downtown, took us roughly 50 minutes. All in all, it was a nice gameday but if you are not invested in the gig, the Coliseum per se is nothing special."
6832,Date of experience: December 2017,1-Jan-18,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Home of SC Trojans & LA Rams,Old stadium in downtown LA. Parking during football games is expensive. Overall it is well maintained and the atmosphere is awesome. Right next to Metro station.
6834,Date of experience: November 2017,28-Nov-17,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Historic stadium,"Lot of history in the stadium, built for the 1932 Olympics and they even light the torch during football games. We walked on so easy to get in and out of. Paid 30 bucks for parking at some one's home a few blocks away and that was a wise decision, had no traffic issues on our way out. Food choices are plenty and lots of rest rooms. The seats are rusted but actually reasonably comfortable. My wife's team,  Saints didn't have their best game but still an enjoyable experience ."
6835,Date of experience: November 2017,27-Nov-17,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Great experience to see football game,"We went to see the rams and the saints play. Easy to park about a 10 minute walk to the collisuem. Plenty of food options. Many rest rooms. Seats are just fine we were in row 19 , section 20.  A great game and experience."
6836,Date of experience: November 2017,21-Nov-17,Big Ten,UCLA,5,LA Trip,Came to watch my Texans play the Los Angeles Rams and it was a tough loss but the coliseum is awesome. Full of history you cannot go wrong visiting this place. It is truly breathtaking in some way.
6837,Date of experience: November 2017,19-Nov-17,Big Ten,UCLA,4,A classic stadium but be careful where you seats are,"Built for the 1932 summer Olympics, the Memorial Coliseum is a great place to take in a football game (ideally a USC match against a rival like UCLA).  It gets loud, there's a great selection of food on the lower perimeter of the stadium and the views to the city and mountains in behind from the upper rows are great.  Do be careful where you choose your seats.  The stadium was designed for track and field, not football, so the views from sections 26-29 and 1-4 aren't great - the far end of the field is a long, long, long away.  It's easy to get here taking the Metro Expo line."
6838,Date of experience: November 2017,7-Nov-17,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Tips for using  MetroRail to USC games at Memorial Coliseum,"LA is a car city, but as an alum that no longer lives there I have finally started using mass transit into the Colliseum for USC games and recommend it, if you learn the basics. First off the definitions: Metro Rail is an urban rail system in Los Angeles.  Metrolink is a commuter rail system that brings people into LA and then hooks up to the Metro Rail and Metro Bus.  I think that is what confuses people: these terms are NOT interchangeable but completely different forms of transit.  If you ask ""how do I catch the metro?"" it doesn't get you far.  If you ask ""how do I catch the train?"" you may end up on the way to San Diego. To use the rail system to get to the game you want MetroRail (a combination of light rail and subway).Tap Card: looks like a hotel key card and fares you purchase we be loaded on to it so that when you go through a turnstile at a station you will ""tap"" your card and the fare is electronically deducted. Stations have ""vending"" machines and you will purchase a Tap card and a fare to be loaded onto it.  Don't throw the Tap card away, who knows you may get the hang of this faster than I did and hit the town. What rail line to take: Your goal is to catch the Expo Line from the 7th St/Metro Station because from this station you catch the rail line that serves USC/Colliseum.  Know exactly where you are coming from and then you can go online or  ask your hotel/friends to help you find which Metro Rail line and transfers you need to get to the 7th Street/Metro Station to catch the Expo line to USC. For example, we are in South Pasadena and the closet rail station is Union Station.  We can drive/park there, or ride share (uber) to Union Station and take the red line to 7th Street Metro Station and transfer to the Expo Line.  Once we tried to bypass Union Station and ride share directly to 7th street/Metro Station.  We found that at street level there is no big signage that says ""7th Street Metro Station"", so if you get to  7th and Flower Street, or 660 S Figuero (in the Financial District) you are there.  Get out of your taxi, ride share etc and look for people taking escalators DOWN into the station.  If you see anyone in a USC team colors just ask them to show you what to do (follow the football gear).  Once inside the station look for the big vending machines, you will see lots of people using them to buy a Tap card and fare for the Expo Line.  There are also employees and staff available.  Feel free to ask for help, they want you to use the Metro system.Once on the Expo Line you can get off at Jefferson St. which is the north end of campus and where the new University Village is.  Or continue directly to Exposition Park which is the closest station to the coliseum and is on the south end of campus.Return fare.  if you did not book a round trip fare you can purchase one at a small table set up for this just south of the tracks.  Do this NOW, not after the game to avoid crowds. After the game: you can do the reverse, but in addition to the light rail back to 7th street they now have Express Buses to help handle the large crowds after the game that need to get to 7thSt/Metro Station to make connections.  The buses are faster.  Then at 7th/Metro  catch the  other line you came in on, get a cab or call an Uber.Ride Share at Union Station:  Very important that if you want them to pick you up at Union they are supposed to use ""Pick up and Drop off"" which is noted on the building but is underground.  As soon as you book your ride, call the driver to make sure they know to come into the underground parking area to get you.  This is especially important due to safety if you went to a game that ended after dark or are new to the city.  Union Station security will keep an eye out for you.  I am not sure of the ride share set up at other stations.Metrorail will cost you about 5.00 or so round trip.Parking in the area of the Coliseum is limited, expensive ($50-150) and real confusing after the game due to road closures directing people out of the neighborhood.  You'll rarely go out the way you game in and that can be more time consuming and stressful than learning the Metro system.You can sometimes get an Uber to get you to the game but not out of it (they can't get to you)We use ride share to get to a station and then let rail get us to the campus/Colliseum.  And then we use rail to get out of the post game crowds and then call ride share/taxi."
6839,Date of experience: October 2017,5-Nov-17,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Nice and historic but could use some upgrade,"It's a great place to take pictures and watch a football game. However, parts of it is in decay, especially the bench section. I've never been to a professional stadium where there are benches. They are old with peeling paint, and prices are not cheap either. Like any other stadium, food and drink are very expensive."
6840,Date of experience: October 2017,24-Oct-17,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Favorite place to watch football,"I've been in stadiums all around the USA.  This one is just greater - the experience is heightened by the Olympic structure.  And there is nothing like the sound of the Trojan Marching Band (saw Utah vs USC).  Great game.  People were extremely friendly when visiting from Utah, unlike the jerks from South Bend, Indiana who seriously need to get a life - but not everyone can be from USC. Win or lose, nothing compares to being a member of the Trojan family.  The sunshine, the cheerleaders, the traditions - a truly complete University and an unparalleled place to watch the great game of football.  No wonder the Trojans have more Pac 12 football championships than any other team in the conference.  They've been given a magnificent place to Fight On!"
6841,Date of experience: October 2017,23-Oct-17,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Football Fans Delight,We saw USC v. Utah which turned out to be an extremely exciting game.  The stadium itself is somewhat outdated but definitely worth experiencing.  The area is great for pregame tailgating but a little concerning after dark.  Fans were friendly even after we told them we??re visiting from South Bend and are huge Irish fans.  All in all it was a great experience to see the host site for the 1988 summer Olympics.  The only thing better was when ND stomped them a new mud hole the following weekend.  Go Irish!
6842,Date of experience: October 2017,15-Oct-17,Big Ten,UCLA,4,"Built for Gladiators, I think!",A very different type of stadium than what I'm accustom to.  We attended the Rams vs. Seahawks and I'd never seen such a structure for sports with all of the vendors outside of the stadium.  Way too hot for me with way too much sun.  I like the stadiums that have covers and A/C.
6843,Date of experience: September 2017,23-Sep-17,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Must see Awesome Sports Coliseum!!,"Went to the USC vs Texas football game. Visiting the Coliseum was an experience in itself. Its amazing from the lighting of the flame to the over 90,000 seats to watch a game. The atmosphere is electric. This is an historic venue as it was the site of the 1984 Olympic games. All the seats in the stadium are well situated."
6844,Date of experience: September 2017,21-Sep-17,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Visited for USC vs Texas Game 2017,The stadium is still nice for such an old place. The seats were comfortable. My main complaint is the parking and the dangerous areas surrounding the coliseum (but the LAPD did a good job of having officers on virtually every relevant corner when the game ended and it was dark and spooky).

It was awesome, felt like a Redskin home game. With all the money and bling it was nice, won??t last but nice. People of LA if you don??t want a team just say so, or show up! They deserve better attendance than you are giving them. The stadium needs a lot of work, no Way is it ada compliant! Good luck Rams!"

6847,Date of experience: September 2017,16-Sep-17,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Big but drinks expensive,"We went to the Coliseum to watch USC play a college football game. The stadium was massive, much bigger than our UK football stadiums. It was good to visit the home of the 1984 Olympics. We sat very high in the stadium but our view was brilliant due to the stadium design.  Our only criticism is that the drinks were expensive in the stadium, $4 for a bottle of water, $5 for a coke and $6 for a lemonade. Alcohol wasn't served. There are water fountains so you can buy a drink and then fill up the container with water."
6848,Date of experience: August 2017,16-Sep-17,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Chargers vs. Rams,I lived in LA my entire life and it took me 30 years till my first visit to this amazing place. I enjoyed a historic football game here and loved every moment. The place is old and falling apart but its part of the LA charm.
6849,Date of experience: September 2017,12-Sep-17,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Real American high school experience,"Best thing to do on your trip to LA? Whether you like sports or not?1. Buy a ticket to a game of USC Football2. Buy a box of canned beers3. Go to the bookstore on campus and buy a shitload of USC Trojans gear, or not.. 4. Tailgate with all the students, fans and other football fans on campus and then go with the flow. Make sure you take all day for it and you won't be disappointed. Best experience ever!"
6850,Date of experience: August 2017,2-Sep-17,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Good time !,"We caught a L.A rams pre-season game .Lots of people ,good atmosphere great time nice stadium ,can complain would do it again ??"
6851,Date of experience: August 2017,29-Aug-17,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Definitely outdated but still good,"First time visiting for a Rams game recently, the stands are still original so they are small and close together. Still a good stadium but parking is expensive"
6856,Date of experience: August 2017,3-Aug-17,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Nice historical spot,The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is just west of downtown LA and is easy to get to and offers an interesting spot to enjoy a very historical site which will be home to another Olympic games soon.
6857,Date of experience: October 2016,20-Jul-17,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Old but with Soul,Even though it is a pretty old stadium and the facilities could be greatly improved there is no better experience than going to the Coliseum to watch an SC game. Everyone is cheering and it is honestly an amazing experience
6858,Date of experience: September 2016,13-Jul-17,Big Ten,UCLA,4,A must see for a sports fan,"LA Coliseum has history around every corner, it's a great place to visit and since there's such a large number of seats some of the tickets are often on the cheaper side for sporting events. It's located right next to USC which has a beautiful campus and excellent transport facilities, although on hot days it's important to remember there's no shade and on our last visit our section of the stadium ran out of water bottles. Come prepared!"
6867,Date of experience: January 2017,28-Jan-17,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Awesome stadiun,We watched a Rams game here in December and it was great. The stadium is huge and the atmosphere was very electric.
6869,Date of experience: November 2016,17-Jan-17,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Really Needs Facelift,"We have been here several times over the past 20 years, and almost nothing has changed. LA Memorial Coliseum's historical significance is unmatched. It ashamed that it seems to be eroding away. Parking is ridiculous, concession stands are minuscule and seats are uncomfortable. This stadium deserves to updated, but keep it's Romanesque look."
6872,Date of experience: January 2017,3-Jan-17,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Awesome stadium,"This was my first time visiting the coliseum since the return of the LA Rams. I must say, the stadium has that old feeling. Reminds me of being in Rome. I really like the stadium due to the cardio required. Plenty of steps, good for workouts, bad for intoxicated people."
6873,Date of experience: November 2016,23-Dec-16,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Parking Sucks - Food Choices Limted - Rams Offense weak,"If you are going to the Rams game - Be Prepared. Parking can easily cost you $50+.  We parked across the way at USC for an outrageous $50.  Regular fans knew to bring a clear, strong plastic bag for their food and drinks.  I would highly recommend you take the Metro because of traffic and parking.  If you are going to a day game and don't want sit facing the sun the entire game sit on the South side.  The offense was a yawner and the play calling was predictable and did not match the strengths of the offense."

I don't believe it is the best venue for watching football but we really had a great time.  The Food was surprisingly good.  The restrooms are a bit of an issue, taking a good while to get in line and get done.Parking can be a bit tricky especially if you like to tail gate.The metro handles the crowd very well."
6876,Date of experience: November 2016,1-Dec-16,Big Ten,UCLA,1,What a dump,"One of the most famous stadiums in the USA and what a let down this dump of stadium is.If I was in charge I would recommend demolishing the whole place and the building of a fit for purpose new stadium, however as the stadium has held held 2 olympic games it isn't going to happen.The seating is terrible - benches - poorly signed and there is no cover anywhere in the viewing areas and you have to walk a long way to the toilets and concession stands.I had looked forward to visiting this stadium and it wasn't worth the wait"
6877,Date of experience: November 2016,9-Nov-16,Big Ten,UCLA,3,First visit to La Coliseum for NFL Game,"Had to see this stadium once, so went to an NFL game -- first, parking on side streets wasn't too hard for free -- you may have to walk a bit but definitely worth saving the $20-$40 or more being charged....lots of tailgating -- we didn't have tickets so went to the stadium to buy -- I guess ticket reselling is frowned upon in this establishment but eventually we found some resellers -- prices ran about half face, we offered less, walked away when they said no and then they came after us and eventually we bought at a reduced price.   Stadium is old and shows it age but food choices outside and on the concourse are decent, the 1984 Olympic stuff was very nice to look at and review -- with the sun, there isn't really any shade in the stadium, so be prepared to cook unless it is a later game (part of the stadium does get shade) -- many stay out of their seats till just before game time to stay out of the direct sun -- huge stadium, lots of history -- worth visiting once..."
6880,Date of experience: October 2016,17-Oct-16,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Be Prepared!,"Went here October 8 2016 for a Rams/ Bills Football game. First off, NO parking at the venue, it is all pre sold and you must pay ransom pay to park nearby at private lots. Upwards of $60. Then try to enter the venue...NO purses, no bags go check your purse in with them after the LONG line or dump all your stuff in a plastic bag and still leave your purse with them But wait there's more! No tobacco of any sort allowed inside. Mistake #3 don't bring a person that can't be without tobacco! So my other ticket holder refused to go in if no tobacco and NO IN & OUT at all! So there I stand, inside the gates with my $85 ticket alone as my partner decides No tobacco, not going in! I am holding 4 waters, 2 drinks, 2 hot dogs, 2 chips. Show my ticket and I am directed to walk halfway around the stadium to be told ""NO your seat is back at other end"" So there I go again to where I started carrying everything to be told by yet another guide ""NOPE you are at other end"" where I just walked from again! I complain and he decides to walk me back to other destination I left twice before. Still carrying 4 waters, 2 drinks, 2 hot dogs, 2 chips alone and its damn hot and impossible to maneuver thru the crowd who is actually hostile to my Buffalo Bills garb. Made it to my seat in time for half time when I entered 30 minutes before start of game. Ended up going to parking lot at halftime to sit at someones camp and watch the game on their TV powered by generator, in a comfortable recliner with free beer. Only good thing I have to say ids the Bills beat the Rams!  ."
6881,Date of experience: October 2016,11-Oct-16,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Know the rules ahead of time for NFL games!,"We came for a Rams game. It was my first NFL game so here's some tips for others who might have been in the same boat. You can't bring in bags or backpacks. Most people carry clear 12"" x 12"" NFL branded clear tote bags. Women can bring in a purse the size of their palm, but they are very strict about it. Mine was okay, but my mothers which was just a few inches larger was not. They took it to security and she had to pick it up after the game. There are express lines if you don't have a bag. You can bring in 2 bottles of water but they must be factory sealed. We froze ours the night before, so we had cold water at the game. They had free water re-fill stations (not sure if these are permanent - apparently they had run out of bottled water at the first Rams game). Food is VERY expensive so I advise eating before you arrive. The best value I found there was a hot dog for $6.50. All other hot food was $10 - $15. Lines were long for beer at half time and at some of the food stands, other food stands were okay. Some places were selling water for $7 but we saw it for $5 at others so check around. The rules say no food allowed but we were able to bring in small bags of pop corn, pretzels etc. I saw other people bringing in similar items so I'm guessing the no food rule relates more to hot food or picnic meals. If you arrive early, check all the gates, some open earlier than others. They will allow you to enter the stadium early, but have a set time before you can enter the Coliseum itself. I heard there was problems getting people in on the first game against the Seahawks. They must have ironed out the kinks because we didn't see any long lines of people waiting to get in and the stadium was pretty much full when our game started. To be on the safe side, I'd advise arriving at least an hour before the game starts. We had seats behind the goals in Section 13. There is one big screen which was directly behind us, it was a pain in the neck (literally) as we had to twist our heads around to see it. It would have been better if we sat on the sides or at the other end so we can see the screen more clearly. There is a much smaller screen at the other end of the stadium where the VIP area is, but it's not nearly as clear. The seats are individual, not bench style. I didn't find them uncomfortable. You can't bring in umbrellas and there is no shade anywhere, so wear a big hat and sunscreen if it's hot. I also saw a lot of people wearing caps with towels in the hat that hung over their necks, I think they wet them to keep cool. Wait time at the bathrooms wasn't too bad considering the crowd. We took the Metro and it was great. One tip, make sure you have your return fare loaded on to the card when you arrive at the game. There are long lines at the machines afterwards. Also very long lines to get out of there on Metro, it does move regularly so be patient. We actually went to Starbucks and chilled there for a while until the lines eased up a little. There are lots of warnings that parking is not available. My parents parked at a restaurant opposite the Coliseum for $80 (crazy, I know). I also heard there is parking at USC and I did see $10 parking available a few stops down the Metro line. If you arrive early, you could try that but I imagine it goes fast. The Coliseum itself was clean and it was nice to feel the history there. There was a strong law enforcement presence and Metro employees working which was nice as it's not a great area."
6882,Date of experience: October 2016,9-Oct-16,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Football Games,"Cool, vintage, historic venue.  Bring Sun screen and a big shade hat of some sort, there are no shaded seats unless you're in a box.  Will call was at gate 4 for usc games.  Seats are closer together than in modem stadium, the peeps behind you are right on top of you, long legs will put your knees over the person in front of you."
6884,Date of experience: September 2016,7-Oct-16,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Rams Fan Had A Blast,I've been a Rams fan since 1984. I've never had the pleasure of seeing a home game. This was my first time. And I can't tell you how much fun it was. I know the team will have a new high tech stadium in a few years but it was a thrill to see a game here. This place is legendary to me. The views are awesome. The crowd was completely into the game from start to finish. Even sitting up near the scoreboard you didn't feel like you were a hundred miles away like at other stadiums. Hell I got a Coliseum burger and even that was pretty damn good (served on a football shaped bun no less.) I left that stadium that day knowing I'll be back for Rams games as much as I can.
6885,Date of experience: September 2016,24-Sep-16,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Go Rams!,"We saw the Rams vs Seahawks game on Sept. 18th. It was the opening game for the Rams. We were Seahawks fans, but I was so proud of Los Angeles getting a team that I switched sides! Crowds were huge, but friendly. Transportation/parking was no problem for us; we took an Uber.  Bring your own water if it's hot, they did run out 3rd Quarter."
6886,Date of experience: September 2016,19-Sep-16,Big Ten,UCLA,1,Worst sports venue in .... The world,The coliseum is timeless... And the concession lines prove it!!!  45 minutes for a beer and food is unacceptable!

6888,Date of experience: August 2016,23-Aug-16,Big Ten,UCLA,4,KB,"I have not been to the coliseum for about 20 years. We went to see a Chiefs vs Rams game as my wife is a huge chiefs fan. The only down side is there is no real parking at the venue. USC has 5 parking structures but charge 50.00 to park in them. So we took the new metro line from culver city. Cost for 2 round trip tickets from parking lot to Coliseum was 7 dollars. The train was full of other fans and added to the festivity of the night. The train ride was less than 15 minutes. Coming back we had to wait for one train and we were headed back to our car. The venue is old but getting older myself made me appreciate it even more. The history of it being built in 1921 its almost 100 years old. The seats were comfortable. It was clean and kept up.  There are plenty of concession stands but no M and Ms, just peanut.  The staff and law enforcement did a great job directing you out of the stadium and to the right trains to get on.It was a great date night with the love of my life."

Took the advice of another reviewer and parked at the Staples Center for $15 and took the train for $3.50 round trip to/from the Coliseum. Avoided all parking and traffic hassles and was right next door to L.A. Live after the game to get drinks and food.
6909,Date of experience: October 2015,23-Oct-15,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Take metro expo line here,I come here for usc football games and when i attend have been using the metro expo line to get here. You can get off at the usc/exposition stop and its a short walk to the stadium. The venue itself has bench seatings for large portions i suggest you get a cushion becuz it can get uncomfortable sitting on wood benches with no backing but there are rentals available. As for food options its cheaper on the outside
6910,Date of experience: September 2015,14-Sep-15,Big Ten,UCLA,5,See a treasured landmark in Los Angeles,"This stadium has hosted two Super Bowls, a World Series, and two Summer Olympics and is loaded with history. This stadium hosts the University Of Southern California Trojans football team, college footballs premier team with the most successful of any school. The field is usually in very good condition and well manicured. The building itself is very old and dated and it is located in a very rough section of Los Angeles. It is however a very safe place on game day as there are several hundred security and LAPD police officers present to keep the place safe. There is plenty of food and drink for everyone. Pick up sausage or two from one of the street vendors they are very good"
6911,Date of experience: September 2015,7-Sep-15,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Awesome!,"Yes, this is the middle of a not so nice area.  However, there are cops EVERYWHERE!  I sat in field club so my food and beer was provided as a part of the ticket.  I loved this historic venue.  I loved sitting near USC's band.  Simply awesome!"
6916,Date of experience: October 2014,15-Jun-15,Big Ten,UCLA,5,USC Football,"I flew in the LA on a Friday and on the Saturday was USC homecoming. Huge crowd and nice old historical stadium. People were friendly and helpful . Found our seat easy and had a great view. This is a must do it when in LA. It's in a ""Dodgey"" Area but I saw no sign of it being dangerous and felt very safe on the walk back to my hotel"

6924,Date of experience: November 2013,24-Aug-14,Big Ten,UCLA,1,Worst Place to See a Football Game in the Pac 12,"They make you put a 1.  That's a complete over rate of this facility.  I've been to all the stadiums in the Pac12 - This is the absolute worst.  They shove the field to one side of the giant stadium.  You might as well stay at home, you're so far from most of the field - particularly if you make the mistake of buying visitor seating. You can't see anything.  You check the rules on the size of the back pack they allow you to bring in and its a lie.  The won't let you bring in backpacks unless they're those thin nylon things with a draw strap and no pockets, regardless of the size they post on their website.  I will not return."
6925,Date of experience: August 2014,16-Aug-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,very nice.,The view of the stage was great.  Lack of instructions by the venue  for using the arena on where to line up for  entering for seating.
6926,Date of experience: December 2013,15-Aug-14,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Historic Stadium - Still Fun to see Football There,"I have gone to several sporting events at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.   The Memorial Coliseum is a huge coliseum by University of Southern California (USC).  It seats over 100,000 spectators.The coliseum has hosted the Olympics twice - the first time in 1932 and the last time in 1984.  It has hosted Super Bowls and baseball World Series.Now when we go its mostly to watch a USC football game.  The seating is relatively comfortable.  The coliseum itself is an interesting architectural structure."
6928,Date of experience: September 2013,10-Apr-14,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Go for the atmosphere,"We don't have gridiron in Australia so seeing this was an absolutely incredible experience. If you can get to a Trojans game I highly recommend it purely for the atmosphere alone. They sure do take their college football seriously in America! Yes, there were even planes with colourful smoke to kick off the game. I recommend buying a Trojans t-shirt though or they will know you are a tourist haha (as you can see from my photo EVERYONE wears USC merch). We managed to make some friends in the seats beside us who helped us understand what was going on and happily hi-fived us when something good happened. Yes there was overpriced food, long lines and plenty of cheering but at a stadium like this it is to be expected and a small price to pay for an experience I probably won't have again."
6930,Date of experience: October 2013,4-Feb-14,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Go for the Halftime show,"I have not been to the Coliseum in many years, and it was much the same.  Bad seats, bad view, bad acoustics, bad food.  But, the halftime shows were excellent.  The only way you are going to see the whole show is if you go to the stadium and watch it.  Die hard fans of any kind would no doubt love it.  But, you get a better view from the comfort of your own couch or local pub.  We used the Metro Link to get there, so that was pretty good.  That is really the way to go because parking is just as bad now, as it was when I was there many years ago."
6931,Date of experience: January 2014,26-Jan-14,Big Ten,UCLA,3,Soccer Game,I  enjoyed watching the soccer game of Costa Rica Vs Korea. The place was a little too old and everything was way over priced! Churro for $5.00 really? Or am I just cheap? Lemonade $ 6.00 that tated more like water with sugar!
6932,Date of experience: September 2013,4-Oct-13,Big Ten,UCLA,5,USC Trojans home football game,"This was our first time to a football game, it was a middle of the day game and boy it was Hot, but the atmosphere and game was excellent, not as much merchandise available as I would have thought but still bought stuff, what a wonderful place to visit, parking was another adventure, we ended up paying someone to park on the side walk, but it all made for the whole experience, we bought our tickets from StubHub before we left Australia, and we had no problems, just be careful of the bag size you take with you, we had to take a backpack back to the car, the outside atmosphere is great and to be seen also, not sure what time fans arrive but they have full on BBQ's and beers before the game as no alcohol is sold at the game, it was so much fun, Our seats were right behind the goals, great position."
6933,Date of experience: September 2013,22-Sep-13,Big Ten,UCLA,5,USC Trojans games are FANTASTIC!,"Have season seats for the USC Trojans and love going to the home games.  The Coliseum is old and classic, but historic and fun when it is full of Trojan fans.  Have to eat a good bacon wrapped hot dog from the street vendors ($4) before you go into the game and walk through the Rose Garden before or after the game.  Tailgates are abundant and Trojan Pride fills the area."
6936,Date of experience: November 2012,20-Jan-13,Big Ten,UCLA,4,"Great football games, bad surroundings","I've been here three times to see Notre Dame play USC.  The stadium is very loud and as a visiting fan, it's very easy to get around.  Plenty of food vendors and the stadium staff isn't too strict on assigned seats if you're in an area with empty seats.  A few times we've moved over a few sections to empty seats and they never sent us back.Each time we've taken a bus with a group to the stadium, which is good for out-of-towners.  The area around the Coliseum was likely where Menace 2 Society and Boyz N The Hood was filmed.  You don't want to walk away from the stadium and stay in groups.  It's hard for buses to move around after the game with so many fans trying to leave, so expect a wait if you go with a group.  Next time we go rather than take the charter bus, we'll probably go early, pay the $100 parking across the street from the stadium, tailgate, and be able to get out quickly after the game.  I'm sure other game day experiences here are fun if USC is playing another rival."
6937,Date of experience: November 2012,14-Nov-12,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Perfectly located right by USC but seating is old and dated,"I recently attended the USC-Arizona State football game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. It had been decades since I had entered the venue, in fact I believe my last lime was in the mid-1970's for a Monday night game between the then Los Angeles Rams and Washington Redskins. While I found the grounds updated and nice, the seats have pretty much stayed the same; hard and uncomfortable. We sat in the corner of the Coliseum on hard benches. Even the areas that had individual seats were old, hard plastic. Definitely bring a seat cushion with you.However I will say this; even though the seats were uncomfortable the view of the game was still awesome. There appears not to be a bad seat in the house in respects to viewing the game. We were pretty high up but had a great perspective. One thing that definitely has not changed is the traffic, both foot and motor. It is horrible once the game is over. Unless the game is exciting and close (this one was pretty much decided at the end of the third quarter) I would suggest leaving early. Otherwise it could take you 30 minutes just to get to your car, then another hour to get out of the surrounding area. One nice thing though is Metro has a station right at the Coliseum so feel free to take the train to the game. It will probably be a better choice."
6938,Date of experience: November 2012,5-Nov-12,Big Ten,UCLA,4,Awesome Place to attend a USC Gane,Very special sports venue. The grounds are beautiful. Tailgate parties all over the campus. Yhe coliseum has plenty of food selection and plenty of bathrooms. Well organized facility with plenty od staff to get the day going. Very safe. Best places to park are from the locals that live around the area. They will watch you car for $20. Love to go there and take the kids. Very kid friendly.
6939,Date of experience: September 2012,6-Sep-12,Big Ten,UCLA,4,history and history in the making,"It was great to attend a USC game at this historic sporting venue. How else can you say that you attended a college football game with 93,000 people where 2 Olympics, a world series and the Super Bowl have been held? It is an old venue, but it was a great experience. It was well staffed, but be prepared to deal with the crowds at large events. I would highly recommend utilizing public transportation so you don't have to deal with traffic, driving around to find a space and paying $30 to park. We rode the rail ($1.50 one way I believe/$5 for a day pass) and it was a breeze (especially with the new Expo line)! They even had event staff at all of the stops."
6945,Date of experience: December 2011,5-Jan-12,Big Ten,UCLA,5,Great Experience LA Coliseum,"Huge atmosphere at the college football game UCLA vs USC.  Very friendly security guy explained about the car park BBQs.  The whole thing was just amazing and our 2 boys just loved it - the bands, the game, the cheerleaders, the food stalls."

6973,Date of experience: September 2022,8-Nov-22,Big Ten,Washinton,4,Fun stadium tbh,I was in town in September so decided to check out a game while I was here tbh.  Was a blowout since they played Portland state but was fun fans to be around and fun way to spend time on a saturday afternoon.
6974,Date of experience: November 2019,2-Dec-19,Big Ten,Washinton,5,No Place Better For Football,I love it here!   I went to the UW/WSU game and love this venue...where else can you tailgate on the water in a boat and catch a game!  Love this place.  I recommend it for sure.
6975,Date of experience: November 2019,30-Nov-19,Big Ten,Washinton,5,Top notch facility,"The view is fantastic.  I do not think there is a bad seat in the house.  The facilities (WC, food stands, etc.) are plentiful and close.  If there was a down side, my team lost.  But, other than that we throughly enloyed the game."
6976,Date of experience: September 2019,23-Sep-19,Big Ten,Washinton,4,The Zone Is Cool,"My enjoyment of the new, improved Husky Stadium remain the same as my review 2 years ago- wonderful seating, great spectacle.  So, too, do my disappointments - traffic, expense, unpredictable game times.  Some things that have changed have to do with pre-game opportunities.  Unlike a college football like Cal-Berkeley where most Bear fans wander in sometime or another during the game, pre-game activities are a big deal at Husky Stadium, where fans arrive many hours before the game to socialize, play games, and chow down.  It is a great tradition, and given the traffic congestion, probably a necessity to arrive early if you hope to see kick-off.  I've really grown to enjoy The Zone, which is adjacent to the stadium.  The food offerings are sooooo much better than the venues inside the stadium. Plus you can enjoy adult beverages for a fair price, a chance to socialize, and numerous pre-game rah-rah activities.  A huge Plus for those of us to set up a bbq in the parking lot or buzz in using public transportation. Very impressed by the Husky culture and sense of fellowship over many decades, but the new stadium and resurgent team success have combined to make this a fun ticket."
6977,Date of experience: November 2018,11-Dec-18,Big Ten,Washinton,4,An interesting walk,"While returning from some shopping I walked by this stadium. The structure was closed but the external part of it was interesting to see. There were bronze statues of a Jim Owens and Don James nearby, but the most fascinating piece was a real dimension bronze statue of a husky dog. The animal was placed at the center of the main entrance and with his face seemed to welcome all the viewers of sporting events that are played inside."
6978,Date of experience: September 2018,26-Nov-18,Big Ten,Washinton,4,First ever Football game,"My wife and I visited the Dawgs playing against ASU, this was our first ever football game, being from the UK. We were amazed at how massive the stadium is for a college game. There was loads of entertainment before the game and lots of food and drink during. We had a great time with the friendly staff and fans. It was really easy to get to from Seattle using the Light Link rail too."
6979,Date of experience: November 2018,4-Nov-18,Big Ten,Washinton,5,Fun place to see a football game,Husky Stadium is a fun place to see a football game.  It's loud and the fans are into the game.  I had lower deck seats and they had a great view at 21 rows up.  The concourses are wide enough that people can move.  The concessions were limited but the lines moved reasonably fast.  I liked the general party atmosphere and there were plenty of people very willing to help if you had questions.  These people know what they're doing.
6980,Date of experience: September 2018,14-Oct-18,Big Ten,Washinton,4,Stunning Location,This stadium has an awesome vibe for sports enthusiast everywhere! Great venue and lots of seating and room to enjoy the game.
6981,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Oct-18,Big Ten,Washinton,5,"Great Stadium for Alumni, Students and Fans","Sat in Alumni seats - great view.  Went ""Off Leash"" to beer garden - great view, good options. Highly recommend seeing a game here.  GO DAWGS!!"
6982,Date of experience: September 2018,9-Sep-18,Big Ten,Washinton,4,Our chief reason to watch the huskies play,The chief reason my friend and i came to seattle was to catch a huskies game. Its real easy to attend a game here the light rail station drops you off right in front of the stadium. We didn??t have breakfast beforehand and were advised to walk to the university village which was a nice walk thru the parking lot with all the tailgating going on. We had tickets to the topmost level near the 50yd line and it was a pretty decent view. My only complaint was the lack of an escalator to get to the upper levels so its alot of walking. As usual most places have a specialty food represented in the area and here it was bowls of isaccs clam chowder.For those who arrive really early we wandered into the basketball arena and there is a hall of fame museum dedicated to u of w athletics see the history when don james coached the huskies
6983,Date of experience: September 2017,27-Aug-18,Big Ten,Washinton,5,Revamped stadium is more user friendly.,Taking out running track brought the action closer to the fans. Seating has been altered to insure more room between seats.
6984,Date of experience: September 2017,12-Nov-17,Big Ten,Washinton,4,Gotta Love It If...,"I have been enjoying football at Husky Stadium since 1965, off and on. It is a beautiful setting, and we do love our dawgs.  Since the remodel and the television takeover of Pac-12 football and the hellish mess the Department of Transportation has made of I-5, I have mixed feelings about driving around from the other side of Puget Sound to attend games. That said, the seating is much improved from back in the day, as is the view of the field. The biggest surprise is what a great perspective fans sitting in the first dozen rows have of the action. In the old stadium, all you saw were glimpses of the field beyond helmets, tv cameras, and cheer squad. Beautiful sight lines, and comfort and size of seats fit modern fans so much better. Lots of excitement, for sure.  That said, the place is so much more expensive. Plus, you hardly ever know what time a game will start until the week before, thanks to the slavery to TV $$$$.  The entrance and concourses are much improved, as well as restrooms and food service.  I understand that you have to subscribe ($10?) to the east end zone dining/drinking area (fun zone?) after the start of the game, and although it might be an effective way of managing the crowd, it is also another sign of elitism and the desire to kowtow to those who have extra dollars jumping out of their wallets. Link rail improves public transportation into the area, which is good because the cost of parking is crazy expensive on campus or nearby. (Have I mentioned it costs LOTSA LOOT to go here???). Sad there are not more day games because it was a very nice thing for boats to be able to pull in on Lake Washington, and there were several services that brought tons of fans in via water which reduced stress on local streets and highway. Huskies are back to being a top 10 or 20 program, but where have the good times gone??? Certainly not a place to go if you want to be able to make your mortgage payment, or don't feel like spending the whole day getting here and out of here to sandwich in 3 hours of football."
6985,Date of experience: November 2017,8-Nov-17,Big Ten,Washinton,4,Husky stadium,"Liked this stadium. Very nice except for the rain and cold ( guess that is what happens in Nov.). Go early if you can , there were long lines getting off the link and longer lines getting back on. You can take the train or bus right to the entrance, or ferry from across the lake. Tickets were very expensive 100.00  plus 20.00 fees on a ticket service,"
6986,Date of experience: October 2017,30-Oct-17,Big Ten,Washinton,2,Watch out for the bag policy,"Went to the a Husky game this weekend. There is a strict bag policy. It pretty much prohibits any bag unless it's a really small bag or it's a clear plastic one. If you have a bag, your only option is to stand in a long line with all the others who didn't know about the policy and pay $10 to have it held in storage. The game itself was enjoyable enough despite the bag policy and one of the stadium employees giving us totally wrong directions to our seats. We left early so we wouldn't have to stand in a long line to retrieve my bag."
6987,Date of experience: October 2017,15-Oct-17,Big Ten,Washinton,4,Well organized and accessible.,Saw the Huskies thump the Cal Bears here.  It was super easy to get in and find our seats.  Tons of dedicated location buses were waiting outside after the game.  It was  good experience.
6988,Date of experience: October 2017,1-Oct-17,Big Ten,Washinton,5,Great place for a FB game,Beautiful stadium with great views of the lake.  Love the ??sailgating?? they do here.  Fans are friendly and inviting.  Clam chowder in a bread bowl was awesome.  Really liked the fact that the stadium seating areas are mostly covered - at least on the sidelines.
6989,Date of experience: September 2017,15-Sep-17,Big Ten,Washinton,4,Odd tailgating,"Coming from Montana where we are professional tailgaters, the Husky Stadium experience left us scratching our heads a bit.  After spending 20 minutes in one line to get our IDs checked and wristbands attached, we then made our way to the beer lines only to be carded again. This whole process took so long that we had one beer before the game."
6990,Date of experience: September 2017,10-Sep-17,Big Ten,Washinton,5,Take Bus To Big Time Venue,"The University of Washington Husky Stadium is truly a big time venue, with two National Championships for the Huskies over the years. In the past, we've driven and struggled with traffic and scant parking. Lately, we've taken a bus, which is part of a great coordinated transit system designed to drop you right off at the stadium and bring you back. It's really convenient, cheap and efficient. Just ask or follow the purple clothing. There's a festive feel to it."
6991,Date of experience: December 2016,4-Jul-17,Big Ten,Washinton,4,Great place to see some college football,Two big improvement have really made Husky Stadium a place to visit.  The remodel of the stadium itself and the addition of being able to get there via Light Rail.  It's nice that the Huskies are also playing some great football.
6992,Date of experience: August 2016,19-Apr-17,Big Ten,Washinton,5,Go Dawgs!,"What more can be said about this place? Along Montlake, this is one of the most beautiful settings you can watch a football game in. I've been in a few loud games (Stanford in 2016 comes to mind) and it is absolutely deafening. I am not a fan of the Zone, since it takes away from the crowd getting into their seats before the start of the second half, which takes away from the homefield advantage. Hopefully they adjust the policy to close it even earlier before the start of the second half so fans can make it to their seats on time."
6993,Date of experience: November 2016,15-Jan-17,Big Ten,Washinton,5,Why would you want to go anywhere else??,"There is not a better venue in ALL of college football. The Olympics, Lake Union and Puget Sound to the west. The Cascades, Lake Washington and Mt Rainier (if you're sitting in the North grandstands) to the east. Breath-taking. ALSO one of the loudest! AND as a bonus, they now offer reentry privileges with your ticket, you know, in case you forgot something in the car. Say, at half time. GO DAWGS!!Show up early. Tailgating is a must on your first visit (and all visits really). The local hospitality is fantastic and the variety of fare is excellent."
6994,Date of experience: November 2016,23-Nov-16,Big Ten,Washinton,5,Brrr!,"First college game! Tailgating looks exactly as it does in the movies! Lots of college kids and alcohol! Parking was easy but we did have to pay. Not a problem though. Be sure to go early before the game! The stadium is really open and let me just say, it was COLD! And I mean COLD! I was already sick and I was freezing my tail off! I thought I was appropriately dressed too. I had two shirts, one sweater, one jacket, a scarf and a beanie with long bats and boots. It was still cold. My boyfriend ended up buying me a huskies blanket and appranently I was not the only one freezing as he said they were quickly running out of blankets! He happened to be feeezing as well and ended up buying a sweater and a beanie. I held out buying a hot chocolate since sugar isn't good when your sick but gave in after the second half. That did warm me up. Starbucks coffee or hot chocolate was available but I don't drink coffee. Food options were decent but being sick I wasn't very hungry. Overall good experience minus the freezing part! Leaving the game was a bit tricky. We left with a few minutes left in the 4 quarter and it still took roughly 30-40 minutes before we got to the interstate due to all the traffic from everyone leaving."
6995,Date of experience: November 2016,20-Nov-16,Big Ten,Washinton,4,Football palace for the Pacific Northwest,"It's a fun experience to be at Husky Stadium for a football game. Getting there has become easier with the expansion of the light rail from downtown Seattle directly to the stadium. Of course, there are also dedicated express buses from several suburban Park and Ride locations that are a good option too. Some folks splurge and arrive by water to the games as well, either in their own boats or aboard one of several charters that leave from various waterfront restaurants. Now that the UW football team is seeing more success, the games draw bigger crowd, but a sellout is still rare, so waiting for the weather forecast before deciding to go is still an option. Many of the seats are under cover of the cantilever roof, which is a good thing, since it often rains. The recent renovations to the stadium are really nice. There are plenty of restrooms and concession stands, some with decent food options and sight lines to the game are all good. If you haven't already gone, you should definitely take in a Husky game."
6996,Date of experience: November 2016,19-Nov-16,Big Ten,Washinton,4,Great place to watch the Huskies!,Great place to watch the Huskies! But the food....... cold dogs and expensive! 3 normal size franks 2 waters and a coffee..... $30....could have bought two 12th Man Specials at Centurylink for $24 with 4 dogs 2 popcorn and 4 drinks!!! C'mon MAN!!!!!
6997,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Nov-16,Big Ten,Washinton,5,Big time football venue,"Ranks right up there with the stadiums in the Big 10, SEC, etc.  Terrific place to watch college football, tailgating area is close to the stadium, scoreboards and video screens are large and easily viewed.  Not to be missed if you have the chance."
6998,Date of experience: October 2016,23-Oct-16,Big Ten,Washinton,5,Husky Football Game Day!,"Beautiful stadium at the University of Washington with a view of Lake Washington, the city of Seattle and Mt Rainer."
6999,Date of experience: October 2016,23-Oct-16,Big Ten,Washinton,5,One of college footballs most beautiful settings,This stadium is amazing. If you like football I highly recommend going to a game here. Especially this year with the awesome product that you will watch on the field. Absolutely beautiful stadium and in an amazing setting being right next to the lake. The one down fall is the traffic. Take the train their if you can.
7000,Date of experience: October 2016,22-Oct-16,Big Ten,Washinton,5,Husky Game!,"Wonderful time watching the Husky game. Get college setting, highly recommend it! We went to experience Homecoming."
7001,Date of experience: October 2016,17-Oct-16,Big Ten,Washinton,5,One of the great football stadiums in America.,What a wonderful place to watch a Husky football game. The newly renovated stadium is fantastic. It still has all the charms of the older one but has much better seating and wonderful views. Not a bad seat in the house. Lots of parking near and far.
7003,Date of experience: September 2016,10-Oct-16,Big Ten,Washinton,4,Great place to watch college football,We came from New Jersey to cheer on our Scarlet Knights as they played the Huskies. We didn't have much to cheer about but the people we met were very friendly. We were fed and given frosty adult beverages in the pre-game tailgate and met many warm and welcoming Husky fans. The stadium itself is very unique but the view is beautiful as there is a marina outside the stadium where people dock their boats and attend the games. A very unique stadium and some very nice fans made this an enjoyable experience. Why 4 stars and not 5? Poor food choices and antiquated bathrooms.
7004,Date of experience: October 2016,9-Oct-16,Big Ten,Washinton,5,Great atmosphere!,"As always, this stadium is a great place to visit.  Great views around the stadium.  Nice set up for tail gates (parking lot or boat) before game time.  Fun little bars and dining around the campus.  Expect to do some walking.  Only thing I wouldn't purchase again is a pretzel... who knew you could mess up a plain pretzel... so bland and dry ??"
7005,Date of experience: September 2016,15-Sep-16,Big Ten,Washinton,5,Go DAWGS!,"I hadn't been to Husky Stadium since the 80's and I wanted to take my 15 year old to his first college game. We rode the Central Link Light Rail from the Tukwila Station to the UW Station which takes you to the entrance of Husky Stadium. It was a perfect way to get there. Upon arrival, we didn't know they had started the 'Clear bag policy' the NFL has and I had to check in my small, but still to big, bag and pay $10 for it to be stored. We went into the team store and bought a small clear bag to put my wallet and camera in. Not that big a deal, but I'm a Seahawks season ticket holder and already have bags I could have used if I had known. So please remember to use a clear back no larger than 12x12x6 when going to either NFL or college games. I think I'll just take a clear bag to any sporting event now just in case!!! We sat on the home side next to a section of Rutgers fans. They were awesome. Lost horrendously but they were all such good sports and were there to support their team no matter what. My son is in marching band and was inspired by the Husky Alumni band that performed that day.Our seats were very high but the design was easy to get to. We suggest bringing seat cushions as the majority of the stadium is bleacher bench seating. We bought cushions at the team store and were all set. 48-13 was the final."
7006,Date of experience: September 2016,11-Sep-16,Big Ten,Washinton,5,Husky Band Day,"Just returned from husky Stadium after a trip for husky band day. Our stadium experience was fabulous. Although we were all the way up in the top of the stadium in the nosebleed section we were able to see the entire field for the duration of the game. Husky stay it was really the greatest sitting in college football. We sat on the eastside bleachers. To our left was the cascade mtns, and lake washington littered with boats (there to attend the game). The security staff around the game and on the field were super friendly and accomidating to the masses of high school kids attending the game. The football team putnon a show as well, demolishing Idaho. The tailgating was strong after the game as well, and by the number of boats, sailgating was top notch as well. Dawg Saturdays are much better than normal Saturdays. Bow Down."
7007,Date of experience: August 2016,28-Aug-16,Big Ten,Washinton,5,Greatest setting in college football!,"I've had season tickets at Husky Stadium for a number of years now, and I always enjoy the fall for the pure reason that it means college football is close. Husky Stadium is just such a cool place to watch a football game too. The first few games of the season are usually sunny day games, and as the season moves along you are all but guaranteed to have an intense wet rainy battle between two Pac 12 powerhouses. My seats are under the roof where you don't get fully drenched in the rain, which I would recommend for anyone buying tickets.And for those going to those early season games in the Seattle late summer, boat-gaiting is a real thing. You can even ride to he game from over from the other side of Lake Washington if you want."
7008,Date of experience: December 2015,28-Jul-16,Big Ten,Washinton,4,RAIN!,We traveled to Husky Stadium to watch them play the Utes and it was a blast and it poured rain on us but we came prepared with rain ponchos!
7010,Date of experience: November 2015,4-Jul-16,Big Ten,Washinton,5,The Greatest Setting in College Football,"UW proudly proclaims Husky Stadium is ""the Greatest Setting in College Football."" And of all the different places you could take in a college football game in America, this has got to be in the Top 5. I've been to day games when it's 90 degrees in early September, and night games that don't start until 7:45pm in the cold and pouring rain. Either way, this is a special venue to be at. The atmosphere is always great, and when the Huskies are winning, the Go Huskies chant is just something else. If it weren't for the high prices to go to games, I'd surely go to every one each year. It may be among the pricier college tickets around, but it's certainly worth it when the Huskies are winning and the stadium is full."
7011,Date of experience: November 2015,2-Apr-16,Big Ten,Washinton,4,Great place to catch a game!,Was in Seattle and my hometown team was playing the Huskies.  Found the stadium relatively easy to et to using public transportation.  Was a little worried because of the weather but there wasn't a bad seat in the place!
7012,Date of experience: November 2015,3-Jan-16,Big Ten,Washinton,4,First American Football game,"Visited here during our honeymoon in Seattle for the Utah game. This was our first football game and enjoyed the atmosphere and pre/half time game activities, despite the weather! The stadium is amazing with great views of the lake and didn't disappoint. Our only hint for non US visitors would be not to expect to be able to purchase alcohol like at other games due to being college football."
7013,Date of experience: November 2015,29-Nov-15,Big Ten,Washinton,1,"Poorly stocked concessions, awful visiting team seating","Two out of the last three November's we have been to the Husky stadium with our family. Visiting teams that purchase their tickets through their home team athletic fund are given the worst seats in the stadium - the absolute highest upper four corners of this very large stadium. We paid $100 a seat for section 331, row 56... 2 years ago, the poorly stocked concessions were out of hot chocolate at half time (during a very cold game), this year, while it was chilly, it was sunny, not 5 minutes into the second quarter concessions in our section were out of water, by half time, almost all concessions in the 300 level were sold out. The good - the views from this stadium are amazing - Rainier mountain, Olympics, Cascades, Lake Washington- on a sunny day, it is hard to beat the view for sure!"
7014,Date of experience: November 2015,26-Nov-15,Big Ten,Washinton,5,Best CFB venue,"Views of Lake Washington, and the opportunity to sail to the game.  The Zone for tailgaters w/o a parking place.  Multiple tailgating location options, including along the Montlake Cut.  No bad seats.  Covered seating so that occasional Seattle weather is no problem.  Park and Ride options that make access easy.  Light Rail station in 2016.  All of these make attending an event anywhere in the U of W's athletic area a great experience.  Add the best marching band in the west, and a great tradition of NCAA Div. 1 college football, and you have the best of the best."
7015,Date of experience: November 2015,9-Nov-15,Big Ten,Washinton,5,Wedding Anniversary 2015,"Was lucky enough to attend a game here( Washington v Utah} was an amazing experience, The noise, atmosphere and general game day buzz was superb. Beautiful setting,"
7016,Date of experience: September 2015,28-Sep-15,Big Ten,Washinton,5,First Visit to Alaska Airlines Field at Husky Stadium,"Attended Cal (alumnus) versus UW football game this past weekend.  The Husky Stadium is one of the most beautiful football venues not only in the Pacific Northwest, but within the entire US.  The view of Lake Washington and Cascades (albeit the giant video screen blocks some of the natural beauty) is absolutely gorgeous.  The updated and renovated facilities that were completed in 2013 were evident everywhere and it was one of the more modern stadiums I have ever been to.The best part of the day was that Cal won...barely again.  The six straight losses to UW is history!  Go Bears!!"
7017,Date of experience: September 2015,28-Sep-15,Big Ten,Washinton,4,Visit to Husky Stadium,We drove by to see the Husky Stadium and the Washington State Campus. We remarked how steep the stairs looked.  We also watched on TV as Cal beat the Huskies!!!  a couple of weeks later. We are Cal Fans.  The Husky Stadium is nice; but we like the views of the San Francisco bay and our home stadium in Berkeley a bit more.
7018,Date of experience: September 2015,27-Sep-15,Big Ten,Washinton,5,UW vs Cal 2015,Incredible stadium and atmosphere for a college game. We pick a stadium every year to go to with friends and this year it was UW. Could not have been happier with our choice. It was a great game and even better scenery around the stadium. This is a place you want the nose bleed section...325 through 328 upper rows should do. I'm not kidding...the lower rows don't have near as good a view of the lake and mountains and the game too.
7019,Date of experience: September 2015,16-Sep-15,Big Ten,Washinton,4,First Game of the season,"A beautiful day. A great setting for college football, with views ofLake Washington & the Cascade mountains."

UW doesn't have the tradition of Pac 12 powerhouse USC or Oregon but the fans are very friendly and courteous and classy. By talking to the fans abs alumni you can tell that this University is first class all the way. The scenic view of Lake Washington is amazing"
7022,Date of experience: November 2014,6-Jan-15,Big Ten,Washinton,5,This Stadium Rivals Any NFL Stadium,"If you have a chance to get some tickets to a football game at Husky Stadium at the University of Washington, you should do it at least once just to marvel at the state-of-the facility.  Surely, it will rival most NFL stadiums.  Big replay screen, lights, sounds, food-- all of it.  Every taxpayer should go see what's up.  Nevertheless, there is some good football going on inside.  What will you remember most about the visit, the game or the facility?"
7025,Date of experience: September 2014,28-Sep-14,Big Ten,Washinton,4,Large and loud,"Husky Stadium is a huge, 72,000-seat stadium.  Lots of metal bleacher seats allow fans to make a lot of noise banging on the bleachers.The coolest thing about the stadium is all of the boats on the water just outside, and views of the surrounding area.Concessions were pretty varied for a college stadium, but also more expensive.The seating bowls are very steep, and the views are pretty terrible from the nosebleed seats, though the overhang covers most of the upper deck seats, which is a nice feature."
7026,Date of experience: September 2014,24-Sep-14,Big Ten,Washinton,4,Impressive stadium,"Purple is the color of choice for this impressive stadium, all the nicer after recent refurishment.  Holding over 70,000 fans, the stadium is large, fun and noisy!  Nice views of Lake Washington and Mt. Rainier (on clear days)."
7029,Date of experience: October 2013,20-Jan-14,Big Ten,Washinton,5,Still the best place in the country to watch a football game but now even nicer,"If you take in a game at a football stadium in a gorgeous setting right next to a lake with views of the the Cascade Mountains including majestic Mt. Rainier ..well that, up to a point, can make you forget that your sitting in a facility that has seen better days.    In fact Husky Stadium had seen better days many years ago like in the 70's. It was starting to crumble then and continued to go downhill despite a new upper northside  grandstand that was installed in the 80's.  But the lower bowl built in the roaring 20's) had lots of splinter festooned seats  and cracked concrete galore.  And then you had to put up with that silly track that ran around the playing field that kept fans a long stiff arm from the action.  That was the old Husky Stadium.Last fall the new and improved Husky Stadium opened and it is quite something.   Some say it is state of the art ...the nicest college football stadium in the country.  I would have to agree.I took in the Washington-Oregon game last October.  This was a wonderful experience...would been even better had the Huskies won...but this is one beautiful stadium, in the same gorgeous setting.   The track is gone. Great sound system.  More restrooms and much better concession stand arrangement.  The only thing that I would  nitpick is the HD electronic ribbon that circles the stadium with traveling  graphics, animation, ads and such. It  is quite impressive and entertaining but it is hard to read the football scores of other games in progress. But all in all for a 250 million expenditure the University of Washington now has themselves a first class football facility.  If you get a chance go see a game there."
7030,Date of experience: October 2013,1-Nov-13,Big Ten,Washinton,2,A good view of Lake Washington,"I would recommend this for tourists who want to see an early season afternoon football game. Pick a sunny day and sit high up to get the best view of Lake Washington. Other than that, you have to be a Husky die-hard to go here. The stadium remodel is well done, but the seats are very cold and the electronic sound/video/banner advertising are intrusive. This is a problem especially with the long night games, which don't allow the spectacular view the stadium is famous for."

7033,Date of experience: December 2022,17-Jan-23,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,How times have changed,"The first time I visited Camp Randall Stadium on the campus of the University of Wisconsin in Madison was in 1959. I drove through a snowstorm with some of my University of Illinois fraternity brothers to see the Illinois/Wisconsin football game. Illinois won 9-6. Because of the weather, we didn't have much time to explore the campus. On my most recent visit, I didn't see a football game but I was impressed by the many changes that have occurred since my last visit more than 60 years ago. Built in 1917, the stadium lies on grounds of Camp Randall, a Union Army training camp during the Civil War. It is the oldest and fifth largest stadium in the Big 10 Conference. Today, its capacity is 80,321. In 1959, I was one of 63,425 spectators who filled the stadium. But there are so many more noteworthy changes. In 1966, the upper deck on the west side was added. In 1968, the playing surface was converted from natural grass to artificial turf. In 2002, a large-scale construction project added luxury boxes, a five-story office building, separate football program offices, upgraded concession stands and restrooms and new scoreboards. In addition, the numbers of the two Heisman Trophy winners--Alan Ameche (35) and Ron Dayne (33)--were displayed on the upper deck facade. In 2005, the boxes along the eastern rim were added. In 2006, the bronze statues of former coach and athletic director Barry Alvarez and former football star and athletic director Pat Richter were placed in the stadium's Kellner Plaza. At the same time, the retired numbers of Elroy Hirsch (40), Dave Schreiner (80), Allan Shafer (83) and Pat Richter (88) were added to the upper deck facade. In 2014, a new 50-by-170-foot scoreboard and a 4,271-square-foot Daktronics screen with two smaller screens were installed on the north end. Also added were the Student Athlete Performance Center, academic and strength training facilities, multimedia instructional space, a lower level football team access tunnel, renovated locker rooms, showers and equipment storage space. Finally, in 2018, premium seating was added to the south end zone and the press box was improved. It all makes for a truly enjoyable game day experience."
7034,Date of experience: October 2022,28-Dec-22,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great Game Day Experience,"Really enjoyed visiting the University of Wisconsin and watching a football game at Camp Randall Stadium.  If it is your first time going would recommend breakfast at Mickie??s Dairy Bar right next to campus.  Get there early right when it opens.  Can then go tailgate or watch the band before the game.  Good atmosphere, great game day experience."
7037,Date of experience: September 2021,18-Apr-22,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Great environment,"Camp Randall was a great environment for our first away game in the Big 10. The fans were pretty rowdy on our way into the stadium as we walked past the frat houses, but that was expected. We had great seats in the corner of the end zone and no one commented on all of us wearing our PSU gear. The lines for concessions were very long and slow as I waited in line for nearly an hour for 3 soft pretzels and waters. I missed the 4th quarter jump around due to the concession issue."
7038,Date of experience: October 2021,21-Oct-21,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,The Fifth Quarter is a signature tradition,"The first time I visited Camp Randall Stadium at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, it was 1959, I was a sophomore at the University of Illinois, the crowd numbered 63,435, Illinois won 9-6, the field was natural grass and Wisconsin's marching band played the National Anthem and On Wisconsin. Oh, I drove to the campus with three fraternity buddies in a snowstorm. Things have changed since then. Camp Randall has been home to Wisconsin football since 1917. Built on the grounds of Camp Randall, a Union Army training camp during the Civil War, it is the oldest and fifth largest stadium in the Big Ten. Today, it has a capacity of 80,321 and was one of the first schools to convert from grass to artificial turf in 1968. A unique and signature tradition at Wisconsin football games is the Fifth Quarter, a fan-friendly event created by the Wisconsin marching band that was introduced in 1978 and takes place at the end of the game. The band plays a series of songs, including On Wisconsin and Varsity and most of the crowd stays to enjoy the entertainment. In addition, the numbers of Wisconsin's two Heisman Trophy winners, Alan Ameche (35) and Ron Dayne (33), are displayed on the upper deck facade along with other retired numbers--Elroy Hirsch (40), Dave Schreiner (80), Allan Schafer (83) and Pat Richter (88). Bronze statues of Richter, who also served as athletic director at Wisconsin, and former coach and athletic director Barry Alvarez stand in the stadium's Kellner Plaza."
7039,Date of experience: September 2021,6-Oct-21,Big Ten,Wiscosin,2,Disappointed,"Organized vulgar chants from students, inappropriate banners at the stadium, and portapots for restrooms on the upper level concourse inside the stadium! ... was expecting much better from Wisconsin ... I would have to concur with some of the more recent posts in their disappointments too.However, we were treated very, very well by the older Badger fans in and out of the stadium ... we really enjoyed talking and meeting them ...great to see that the older generation still believes in respect and decency."
7040,Date of experience: September 2021,25-Sep-21,Big Ten,Wiscosin,2,Mix of unfriendly and friendly midwestern culture,"There were several giant inflatable badgers setup outside the stadium that were great to get a picture with before the game. We lucked into walking into the stadium while the band played on the way in, which was very fun. Several fans were welcoming, like those on the shuttle from the hotel to the game and a couple going into the stadium, but this was a 1st time to hear F*** Penn State as an organized chant in a stadium. It seems they do this to all teams. It was done several times throughout the game, just as loudly and clearly as any of their cheers. A family of Wisconsin fans in the away game section of the stadium apologized repeatedly for the profanity. This was the 1st away game that we brought our kids too. Unfortunately the cheer was loud and of course our elementary age kids were asking what was being said.  After the game we walked around downtown Madison and generally had a good time, except for a girl yelling the same obscenities from a balcony to any opposing team fans that walked by. I expect the opposing team will get booed when the players come in the stadium, but I was shocked at the lack of respect and basic sportsmanship, it was such a disappointing attitude. Wisconsin lost, but no one was outright hostile and there was never any threat of violence. However, I wish I had known the chants before hand because it would have changed our visit from a family trip to an adult only visit. If you care what little or big ears hear, you may want to reconsider a visit. I heard from other fans that Wisconsin also says ""Eat Sh*t"", but we fortunately didn't hear that in person. Despite all that, there were a good variety of songs and cheering. The jump around was fun, it seemed similar to other songs and stomping in Beaver stadium, but probably more than other stadiums. Our seats were relatively close to the student section, but maybe other parts of the stadium bounce more.  The t-shirt cannon was pretty cool. The 5th quarter with the band playing after the game seems mostly for family / friends of the band. I wouldn't stay to watch it next time, but would just enjoy it on the way out of the stadium. Bathrooms were decent and there wasn't a long line for the women's restroom. They had many porta-potties setup in the stadium and there were long lines of men waiting for those, but it seemed to move relatively quickly.It was probably the longest concession line I've ever waited in. I didn't start a timer, but it was over an hour. I went down right after the 1st quarter thinking there would be a minimal line, but we didn't get our food until after half time. They did have great boxes for carrying food. I asked other fans if the concession was always like that and was told the labor shortage had caused major issues, so hopefully that will improve and not be a concern. Otherwise you'll have to choose between getting food or watching at least a quarter of the game.It was a surprising mix of unfriendly and friendly midwestern culture. We've been to 5 other Big Ten games as visitors in the last 15 years and always had a great experience. We lived in Indiana for 4 years and really enjoyed the down to earth friendliness in the mid-west. This experience did not meet that mark."
7041,Date of experience: September 2021,12-Sep-21,Big Ten,Wiscosin,1,Things have changed,"Not doing well at the moment. Many Concessions closed causing long lines where open. Then there is no cash for reducing COVID but all the bathroom doors are closed and need to open doors anyway, doesn??t make sense. The concessions that are open (with crazy lines) have reduced portions with bad quality and very rude staff. Used to really look forward to going, not worth the price for the poor experience at the moment."
7042,Date of experience: August 2019,3-Mar-20,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Beautiful old stadium,Lots of history here in this lovely stadium. There isn't a bad seat in the bowl but it does get VERY loud if you are near the student section.  Be sure to be in your seat for the Jump Around.
7043,Date of experience: November 2019,23-Dec-19,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Love This Place,So much fun and sportsmanship.  I love going to see the Badgers.  Great updates to the place are coming.
7044,Date of experience: November 2019,25-Nov-19,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great atmosphere,"Fun time at establishments around the stadium, just a great place on game day. It is indeed a great stadium to watch a game. Crowd knows there football, I get the complaint about the lines for restrooms,  but aren??t all games professional and college have that problem?"
7045,Date of experience: November 2019,14-Nov-19,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great place to experience real College Football,"This was my 2nd College game and it was much better than the 1st. I attended the Badgers vs Hawkeyes game and it was a cracker. We were driving up to Green Bay for the Packers Panthers game from Chicago and got lucky that the Badgers were at home to stop off at on the way up.The tail gate areas around the place were great, the atmosphere was crazy and everyone was just up for having fun which was good. There loads to do around State Street and those roads up to the Town Hall more so around the campus area but the more you walk to the stadium the more tailgating was happening.The stadium from the outside looks a bit bland but when you get inside it??s got a much better feel to it. I like the fact it??s all still bleachers to sit on as it??s got an old school vibe, keep them going forever! I was surprised when I saw the capacity was around 80k, it seemed a lot lower but I guess the bleachers help keep those numbers up!The actual game atmosphere was great, my only slight issue was that the student section took so long to fill up? The regular ticket holders around me said that they bring them in row by row and stagger it which I guess is for safety reasons but some of them were still getting brought in at the start of the 2nd quarter which seemed a bit silly to me and unfair on them. The marching band were great and all of the entertainment bits during the game were really fun too.This was a great experience and one I??d definitely recommend to everyone. I loved it."
7046,Date of experience: November 2019,10-Nov-19,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,football game,"We watched a close game between Wisconsin and Iowa. I picked a line at the food service that was the slowest. The person taking the order would only take one order at a time, and he had to wait for everything to be delivered to him for the customer. This was after halftime. The game was great. The restrooms always had lines, but they moved very quickly."
7047,Date of experience: October 2019,14-Oct-19,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great College Football Atmosphere,"This was my first time back at Camp Randall since 1971 and it was not a disappointment. I went with my younger brother, also a UW alumnus, as well as my son. The atmosphere was terrific- everything from the band, to the cheerleaders, to the play on the field. Our seats were not great - we were in the end zone - but it was still fun to be part of a great event and see a truly talented Badger team. The only knock on the venue is that the men and women??s bathrooms are woefully inadequate for the crowd size - UW needs to fix that."
7048,Date of experience: October 2019,14-Oct-19,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,First Time at this Stadium,"Came to watch the Spartans play Wisconsin.  Lost my phone, but it had been turned in to Lost & Found at Customer Service.  A friendly experience getting it back!  Our seats were great!  Everyone was so welcoming to us as opposing fans!  Bathrooms were well stocked and clean. I was trying to find something at one of the concessions and this very kind woman pulled out her phone with an app on it and tried to help me.  She was very accommodating.   Very impressed with this stadium!!  The band even played the MSU fight song three times during the day!  Talk about good sportsmanship!  Of course, they did beat us."

7055,Date of experience: September 2019,30-Sep-19,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great Venue,Camp Randall is a great venue to watch football games. The sound system and graphic boards are outstanding regardless of whether the home team wins or not. There are plenty of restrooms and typically a wide variety of food vendors. The stadium is an experience in and of itself.
7056,Date of experience: September 2019,8-Sep-19,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Everyone Should Get here at least Once!,"Walking into the Camp Randall Fort Entrance while following the Badger Band starts the experience.  The history of this Stadium is everywhere.  The Badgers won 61-0 against Central Michigan!  And even tho' that was enjoyable, the experience of the crowd at this stadium is so fun!  The students keep the crowd going with songs, the wave, Bucky's push-ups and several chants through out  the game.  And the Half time entertainment of theUW Marching Band is awesome.  With everything going on the game goes fast.I think the Packers need to take on some of these fun traditions, for instance, singing Build me Up Buttercup.Upon leaving, everyone was orderly and respectful."
7057,Date of experience: September 2019,7-Sep-19,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,bucky badger,over all pretty fun the only complaint would be the idiots who think they can jaywalk in front of moving cars
7058,Date of experience: September 2019,6-Sep-19,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,"When you say Wisconsin, you've said it all!","Voted as the top college campus in America, Camp Randall on a football Saturday sustains the youthful enthusiasm of the students who attend and yet honors those who came before. Take time to learn why it's called Camp Randall, examine the statues and learn the history and the tapestry of the venue will have one more thread to give it a meaning you will never, ever forget while the game played by true Student athletes will leave you cheering and out of your seats for the infamous ""jump around""."
7059,Date of experience: November 2018,3-Sep-19,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,The BEST College Expirence in the Country!!!!!!,"Nothing beats watching the Badgers at Camp Randall.The waves, the sing-a-longs, the chants, the 5th Quarter and the BEST collegetradition EVER the Jump Around after the 3rd quarter.

7066,Date of experience: October 2018,15-Apr-19,Big Ten,Wiscosin,3,Badger Game,The facility is old.  Most seats are bench seats so you are having to seal clap if you are over a size 28 waist.  The facility does not provide railings to get to your seats should you need it and the steps are narrow and very tight together.
7067,Date of experience: September 2018,13-Apr-19,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great place to watch football,Camp Randall is an exciting spot on fall Saturdays.  There is no place I would rather be on a crisp fall afternoon.

We walked to the Stadium in windy cold weather with occasional rain.  The weather in the stadium varied from sunny and cold, to snow, to rain and back to cold sunshine during the game.  We stayed with a small number of others to enjoy the Wisconsin band playing and they were great!"
7070,Date of experience: January 2019,18-Jan-19,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Always fun,"we are Michigan fans, but whenever we come to camp Randall to watch the wolverines play, the badger fans are always gracious!"
7071,Date of experience: September 2018,16-Jan-19,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Always fun!,"BADGER game day is always a blast.   The bathroom facility's are a little rough depending on the section of where you're seated.  But, it is still a fun experience.  If you can get a tour, it is definitely worth seeing things behind the scenes."
7073,Date of experience: November 2018,5-Jan-19,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great Old Stadium,Saw the last game of the season against the Minnesota Gophers which was a loss for the Badgers but the stadium is full of history and charisma.  The band and the fifth quarter are worth the price of admission alone.  Stay after the game and you will see what I mean.
7074,Date of experience: September 2018,3-Jan-19,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,A great stadium,"The stadium folks are incredibly hospitable, and make the game experience tremendous and safe.The crowd is fun, and traditions are great."

The 5th quarter is one of the best... but you don't need to wait until the end of the game.  After the half (during 3rd quarter) members of the band will come around to the different sections and play.
7078,Date of experience: August 2018,9-Dec-18,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Stadium visit,"Big 10 stadium visit, a must for football enthusiats. To feel the Badger nostalgia is like no other. History, beautiful campus, gift shop and the wondeful Monroe St is plenty to fulfill a whole day."

The 1970's / 1980's facade is awful; the parking ramp gateways to upper deck seats terrible; the insufficient restrooms a problem; the wind howling through every place on a November game very bad. But once the stadium (especially student section fills up), and the band has its way, and the game begins - wow, what an amazing atmosphere. Nothing like it."
7081,Date of experience: September 2018,7-Nov-18,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great College Football venue,"Go Badgers.  Great place to watch what is normally a top 10 D1 college football program.

7083,Date of experience: November 2018,6-Nov-18,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Excellent College Football Venue,"I was very impressed by Camp Randall Stadium during the Rutgers - Wisconsin football game.  The stadium is large, very clean, and all the seats have a fine, unobstructed view,  The concessions are very good, especially the bratwurst, and the prices are not bad.  The  Wisconsin fans are very friendly to the opposing team's fans, and I was able to strike up a nice conversation during halftime.  The Wisconsin Marching Band is impressive indeed.  Rutgers played a competitive game but lost 31 to 17.  Other than that, the stadium and atmosphere during the game was simply outstanding."

7094,Date of experience: September 2018,23-Sep-18,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great experience,"Passing through town and got tickets to BYU/Wisconsin game, unfortunately Wisconsin lost. Parking was easy to find at private home for $25 just a few blocks from stadium. Game day atmosphere was fun and the people were engaging and friendly. Very beautiful & interesting old stadium. Isles were narrow and seating is cramped but had a great time. Very different atmosphere and game traditions (Roll Tide), great to see something different and had a great time. Just wish Wisconsin had won!"
7095,Date of experience: August 2018,20-Sep-18,Big Ten,Wiscosin,3,night game,"We went for the opening night game this year.The band was great, the fans singing was great, jump around was great, the excitement was great.Now for the not so great stuff, the rows are so close together, there is seriously no leg room at all. We had seat backs, and we were lucky the seats in front of us didn't, since that would have further cut into no leg room.Then of course for some reason people cant stay in their seats and feel the need to go in and out umpteen times a game, standing and pushing in front of everyone so they cant see the game..This stadium was built about the time fire was invented, so I guess there isn't any need for lights outside the stadium, since it was 1130 pm when it was over, and its very hard to navigate in the dark."

7097,Date of experience: September 2018,15-Sep-18,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Fun to attend college football game here!,"Wearing a red ??Badger?? t-shirt, I joined my husband and another couple for a University of Wisconsin football game against Brigham Young University. We got four tickets from a re-seller that were in section F at about the 35-yard line. Fortunately, each of our four seats had a cushion and padded seat back affixed to the metal plank. The bleacher rows are close together, typical of college stadiums. The university and alumni bands put on a great performance before the game. Several honors were announced and awards were given to individuals throughout the commercial breaks. Unfortunately, we were sitting directly in front of a speaker and when the music played, it blasted unbearably loud! At half-time, my husband and I got in line for a ??brot?? sandwich (which was pretty good and not terribly overpriced) and a soda. The policy is strict in allowing ticket-holders to bring in only an unopened bottle of water.  Bag restrictions are clearly stated on the tickets and on the Camp Randall website. We parked at a private house a few blocks away and paid the owner $25. Attending a huge college football game (even not being an alumni) and seeing the sea of red, and so many people having a great time in an enormous stadium, must be experienced at least once!"
7098,Date of experience: September 2018,14-Sep-18,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great place,"Great food and people , parking can be a bit of an adventure but usually you can find a space ,  no  shortage of good food and parties to go to not to mention a great football team. There was some construction near the stadium and some flooding in certain areas but all in all a great time was had by all."
7099,Date of experience: September 2018,12-Sep-18,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Fun rocking good times,"So I should preface this by saying I attended the University of Wisconsin during a time when the football team was only starting the renaissance it now enjoys (i.e. during Barry Alvarez's 2nd and 3rd year, 1991-1993). Since then the stadium has been expanded to 80,321 so it is ever more impressive when the fan base and students completely RED out the stadium. Happily we had great seats with awesome sight lights some twenty some rows up from the field in Section Q. That put next to the student section who can be worth the price of admission themselves. The stadium seating can be a bit crampt but the product in the field now is exceptional and the University of Wisconsin Marching Band has always been fantastic and entertaining. It felt great to be back in my academic home."
7100,Date of experience: September 2018,9-Sep-18,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Awesome first time!!,"We went for our first time and took our boys ages 12, 11. Parking was nearby so it wasnt too dar of a walk. Getting into the stadium was easy and people were helpful. The game experience was so fun. My boys saw and heard somethings for the first time but that's part of the college football experience :)I think any seat in the lower part is a great seat. No obstructive views to worry about. Im not surw about the upper seats in the upper level but probably not bad either. There were lots of bathrooms and stalls in each available and great food choices!! We will all be back!If you go, head to State Street to cap off the whole experience!"
7101,Date of experience: September 2018,7-Sep-18,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Outstanding experience,I love going to Badger Games as there is no alcohol served in the stadium.  This allows for a very family friendly environment.  The camaraderie among the students and spectators is amazing.  It always proves to be a fun time.  Stadium is very well kept and organized well.  Not a bad seat in the house!!
7102,Date of experience: August 2018,4-Sep-18,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Beautiful Stadium + Great Fans = Great Experience!,"Let me preface this by saying that I'm an Ohio State fan (gasp I know!) who has always wanted to catch a game at every Big Ten stadium and this one came up for this year. I had always heard great things about Camp Randall and was very excited to be able to come and experience it for myself.First of all, all of the fans, not just the student section was very fun and made the game day experience very memorable. There was no shortage of energy, passion and sportmanship from everyone that we met which made it a great experience. The student section was hilarious! They constantly kept the crowd engaged with chants, waves and singing along to songs which made things fun. Definitely is one of the best college football student sections I've ever experienced!Overall, I would highly highly recommend you check this place out if you've never been to a game before. I'm extremely glad that I came and I'm not even a Wisconsin fan but I definitely think more highly of them now that I've been here!"
7103,Date of experience: September 2018,4-Sep-18,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Nice stadium and nice fans,Attended the Western Kentucky vs Wisconsin game and was pleasantly surprised. Being one of the small group of WKU fans we were treated with respect.  Several people welcomed us and had questions about the school and our lovely mascot Big Red.  Enjoyed the game even though we lost.  The marching band was great.
7104,Date of experience: August 2018,2-Sep-18,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Badger Football,"Of course it??s an ??Excellent?? rating for a Badger football game. So much entertainment besides football with the student section, marching band, big screens and food! Not too long of a wait for restroom breaks and the restrooms are relatively clean.Look for me; I??ll be wearing red!"
7108,Date of experience: October 2017,24-Jun-18,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Cannot beat the Big 10 football experience here!,"A great family atmosphere for Big 10 football.  Although there is plenty of drinking going on during before-game tailgating, there is no beer served in the stadium.  The level of football, fans and band cannot be beat!"
7109,Date of experience: October 2017,18-Jun-18,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Badger games are always AMAZING!,"I may be biased as an alum (and enjoyed the Roooonnnn Daaaayyynnnne years), but if you've never attended a Saturday game with the Badgers, you are missing out. I've been to a few other college game days, and none of them even come close to the electricity within Camp Randall Stadium. The student section is always raucous and laden with traditions. Singing and dancing at every opportunity. You might already be familiar with Jump Around. And the UW band's 5th quarter with dances for each song is always fun (especially when celebrating a win!).The last couple decades have been great for Badger football and Camp Randall is an excellent place to attend a game!"
7110,Date of experience: September 2017,4-Apr-18,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Jump Around,"This stadium is a great mixture of an older structure with all kinds of history and updates that keep it competing with the new stadiums being done constantly. With it being older and a little more cramped, lines for restrooms and concessions can get long.The atmosphere is unlike any other though. You can??t go here and not enjoy the whole experience. Outside the stadium is great bars, restaurants and fraternity activities that all add up to a great time."
7112,Date of experience: August 2017,12-Mar-18,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,What a college football stadium should be,"I have not been to a game, but had the opportunity to visit the stadium before the football season started with a business contact who works at the schools.This is a massive stadium - I can only imagine how awesome this place is during a game!  I recommend visiting the stadium even if there's no game.Enjoy!"
7114,Date of experience: November 2017,22-Jan-18,Big Ten,Wiscosin,1,gave up football tickets after 29 years,"can not sit in your seat- too small seat and they try to squeeze as any in as possible,  too much swearing from student section.High prices for snacks... I use to have fun going to games, not so much anymore- would rather watch on TV.  Tired of people hitting me in head or kneeing my back"
7115,Date of experience: October 2017,4-Dec-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Go Badgers!,Really kool to go on a game and watch some Jump Aroiund. Go Badgers! Just to be around on a game day is fun!
7116,Date of experience: November 2017,26-Nov-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Always a GREAT Time at Camp Randall!,"We go to Badger home games a couple times each season.  We usually get our tickets on stubhub.  Our tickets have been all over, and we've enjoyed ourselves no matter where we sat.  The student section is so fun to watch.  They don't sell alcohol in the stadium, so you'd have to grab a drink before you enter.  Make sure to check the bag/purse carry-in rules before you arrive.  Make sure to stay for the incredible Wisconsin band's ""Fifth Quarter"" and parade back through the streets of Madison."
7117,Date of experience: September 2017,26-Nov-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,First and ten Wisconsin,My 11 year old enjoyed his first college football experience.   We bought tickets on Stub Hub that were reasonably priced.   The crowd really gets into it.   Be aware that the student section has its own colorful cheers that are audible so you might not want to bring kids that are too young.    Bucky is a treat to watch as he does push ups equal to the Wisconsin score after every touchdown.   Seats are very packed in.
7118,Date of experience: November 2017,22-Nov-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Visit would have been better if Michigan had won :),"Smaller stadium than I'm used to.  We were in the last row in section DD, which was actually nice as we had a wall rest our back against.  It did take a while to get to our seats with all the ramps we had to walk up.  The music was kind of loud due to the presence of a large PA speaker about 20 feet away, pointed directly at us.  Snack bars were more prevalent than restrooms, which caused some long lines at halftime."
7119,Date of experience: November 2017,19-Nov-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Nice Stadium,"Though our team lost, we still enjoyed the game at Camp Randall Stadium.  The people were all very friendly.  We especially liked that the seats we bought had padded cushions with backs!"
7120,Date of experience: November 2017,15-Nov-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,No place better to see the Big Ten play,"Camp Randall is a Big Ten icon that makes 80,000 fans all feel at home. A recent renovation improved added to the comfort and safety without any loss of charm. The fan tradition of singing ""Sweet Caroline,"" ""Build Me Up, Buttercup,"" or bouncing in unison to ""Jump Around"" cheers everyone up no matter how your team is doing. Be sure to stick around for the UW Band's 5th quarter performance."
7121,Date of experience: November 2017,15-Nov-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,College Football at its BEST,"There are certain football stadiums around the country that if you have the opportunity to go and see a game, you should. Camp Randall in Madison, WI is one of those venues.You most likely will not be parking close by unless you go early! But the walk up Regent Street to the stadium is very, shall we say, flavorful and you are not left wanting for anything. Access to the stadium seating is easy and well marked, but you will be walking. But this would be true of any large stadium. College sports atmosphere at its best. Oh, and if you can, stay for the 5th quarter!"
7122,Date of experience: November 2017,13-Nov-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Wisconsin vs Iowa - Go Badgers!!,"Excellent fans, lots of fun!!!  Super friendly locals.  Great place to see a College Football Game.  Be prepared to sit in traffic for at least an hour to get anywhere after the game."
7123,Date of experience: November 2017,12-Nov-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,3,Good experience but make sure you eat before going into the confined property.,"Been to all home UW football games for years. Enjoy the UW football and band performances but really disgusted (and increasingly more every year) at the obvious UW Athletic Department's driving attitude of ""It's all about getting more money"". The hot dogs, brats, nachos, pretzels food is normally marginal flavor,.. small servings, hot food is normally cool - (warm at best), hot chocolate is very weak flavored warm water - (and recently is now even a smaller size)...All at ridiculously high prices...Even the games are nor controlled by the TV stations commercials ... and the jumbo-tron is now being 60% surface wide by advertisements .. instead of giving spectators enjoyable readable statistics on other events, those blasted ads prevent much of the information from being viewable."
7124,Date of experience: October 2017,10-Nov-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,I am a Big Badger Football Fan!,"If you can get tickets, the game is the place to be on a Saturday! Even if you are not a Badger fan, the UW Wisconsin fan will be entertaining to watch."
7125,Date of experience: October 2017,9-Nov-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,3,Awesome game experience despite the tight seats and lame concessions,"It's hard not to get caught up in the fever of the game with the band and students giving it as much effort as the players.  Most folks won't leave before the 4th quarter no matter what the weather or score just so they can participate in the iconic Jump Around experience!  Eat before you come because the food is not worth the price.  Yes, the seats are tight but most people respect each others' space the best they can."
7126,Date of experience: October 2017,9-Nov-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Always incredible,We visited in October and watched our beloved Badgers beat purdue. With the Wisconsin marching band and the fifth quarter the place is electric.
7127,Date of experience: August 2017,8-Nov-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Who doesn't love Camp Randall?,I've been visiting Camp Randall since I was a kid and it never gets old. The energy is electric during football games and the neighborhoods and businesses surrounding the stadium are just as  lively and fun during tailgating. I think everyone should go to Camp Randall at least one time in their life! Go Badgers!
7128,Date of experience: September 2017,5-Nov-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great Place to See a Game,"First time here, visiting to watch a Badger game and we were not disappointed. This is a historic, 100 year old stadium with modern additions. It was easy to find and easy to get in. But a little difficult to find our seats as the isle signed were not traditionally organized. These are bench seats and a little uncomfortable. The game was fun and the home crowd was energized, making for a fun game to watch. I do recommend this place for anyone liking to explore college football."
7129,Date of experience: October 2017,31-Oct-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Lots of fun,"Great venue, crowd has great team spirit and at times can be very loud and wild.  Stay for the fifth quarter and enjoy their great band. I recommend staying a little longer to let the crowd thin out."
7130,Date of experience: October 2017,24-Oct-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Always awesome,Coupled with a pre-game celebration at South Union...what could be better than an afternoon spent at Camp Randall.  And stay through the Fifth Quarter--even if it's a downpour.  Totally worth it!
7131,Date of experience: September 2017,22-Oct-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,On Wisconsin!,Of course....why would you not want to join in the fun.  Hear the band play...watch a top notch football game and jump around.  Wear your red and jump up and down with the rest of them!
7132,Date of experience: October 2017,21-Oct-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Go Badgers!,"Is there a better place in the country to watch a college football game?!  I think not.  You'll be immediately energized by all the enthusiasm of the students and other fans in this historic environment.  Enjoy the animated student section, great marching band, and hopefully you'll get to see Bucky and leave with a Badgers win!"
7133,Date of experience: October 2017,16-Oct-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,2,"Great atmosphere to watch football, terrible tiny seats.","We had seats along the 50 yard line behind the Badgers bench.  These are not seats, but just a long bench with numbers printed along the length of the bench.  My daughter and I are both about 125 lbs and we were shoulder to shoulder with our neighbors on either side of us.  My husband and son were behind us and my son had to sit sideways the whole game and my 6'4"" husband had to lean forward the whole game to sit.  Great energy in the stadium but terrible seats.  My husband said he will never go to antother game."
7134,Date of experience: October 2017,12-Oct-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,3,Great atmosphere for football.,"Seating is very tight in the stadium.  It gets uncomfortable when all the seats in a row are filled.  Students cheer and use foul language.  Not enough rest rooms, plan to go before or after half time."
7135,Date of experience: October 2017,8-Oct-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Go Badgers,"This is an old stadium, but there is so much history here. If you don't have season tickets, you might have to search, but the university is now selling seats and season ticket holders often sell them as well.  My biggest complaint is the steepness of the steps. The bathrooms are clean, the stadium is clean and there is a nice variety of Wisconsin food served during the game. Don't expect to buy a beer or a cocktail, there is no alcohol served."
7136,Date of experience: November 2016,3-Oct-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,3,weird,"Sometimes I go to witness sport celebrations. I observe people celebrating. Great photo ops. I've been to a few football games, a basketball game and two Pink Floyd shows. Mainly I go to observe the events from the outside to take photos."
7137,Date of experience: September 2017,2-Oct-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Best football around,"Great college football experience. From Jump Around, to Build me up Buttercup, to the multi-dimensional wave, the student section makes the experience amazing.  Oh yeah, team is good too."
7138,Date of experience: October 2017,1-Oct-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Lots of history even for a stadium,Camp Randall used to be a civil war training area and there are a few statues and cannons to remind one of the history.  Now it is home to the Wisconsin Badgers and part of the University of Wisconsin campus.
7139,Date of experience: October 2017,1-Oct-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Best College Stadium Experience in the US!!!,"How can it be any better!!!  Always something to do and see!!  First of all Great Football!!  It doesn't get much better than this!!!  Then there is the band!!  Again, it doesn't get much better than this!!!  Before during and after the game, the band leads the way!!  The cheerleaders and dancers are great and best of all is Bucky!!!  He is a wild man!!  Start your day off tailgating, head the Union South for the band, take a picture by Camp Randall arch and Bucky Badger Statue.  Head into the stadium for warmups and the band.  Watch a great game with the students getting into the action!! Half time band!!  More game, and then the number one activity in college football, JUMP AROUND!!!  Then the Badgers win the game and on to the 5th quarter!!!  How can it get any better!!!  Enjoy the exhilarating experience!!!!  You have to do this!!!!"
7140,Date of experience: September 2017,30-Sep-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Game Day,I've been to many large college and pro football stadiums and the game day experience at Camp Randall rivals all that I have seen. The crowd and historic stadium are simply incredible!
7141,Date of experience: October 2016,30-Sep-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Top notch stadium,"No Madison trip is complete without a visit to Camp Randall Stadium. Try to catch a Badger football game if you can! Lively crowd, good concessions and the marching band is fantastic. Avoid the student section unless you're looking for the ""college"" experience - it can get pretty rowdy."
7142,Date of experience: September 2017,30-Sep-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Go Badgers!,"Hands down the best place to watch a football game.  I have seen a lot of games in my life and very few match the excitement and entertainment value of UW Madison.  Section I was close quarters as we wanted to be near the band, but everyone was friendly and considerate. A great time all around."
7143,Date of experience: September 2017,19-Sep-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,The reputation is well deserved,"They call Saturday in the fall at Camp Randall the best college football atmosphere in America and I'm not arguing with them one bit. From the pregame yard parties that spring up at dawn to the sea of red inside and out of the stadium to the game traditions (can you jump around or do the reverse wave or polka during the 5th quarter?), you've done it all when you visit this historic venue."
7144,Date of experience: September 2017,10-Sep-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Welcoming,"I wouldn't want to have to drive and find parking near the stadium, but there seem to be bus shuttles available.  Once inside the stadium the atmosphere is friendly and positive."
7145,Date of experience: September 2017,9-Sep-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Go Bucky.,Went to the Florida Atlantic game. Gotta love Bucky and the football atmosphere. Football weekend with the badgers and packers. Good wknd from Texas go Bucky
7146,Date of experience: September 2017,6-Sep-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Badger's Stadium,The stadium is beautiful. It's one of the oldest stadiums of the colleges. It's fun being in the area on a game day.  Lots of student and people.  Very exciting!
7147,Date of experience: September 2017,6-Sep-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great atmosphere,"Went to 1st football game of 2017. Dynamic atmosphere.  Pregame at the union south to hear the uw band is always a good start. Then off to the camp to see the game. Seating is cramped even with the seated seats, but game was awesome. Jump around is the best."
7148,Date of experience: September 2017,4-Sep-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,EVERYTHING  WE  EXPECTED.......BUT  HANDLE  WITH  CAUTION,"My  wife  and  I  made  our  annual  college  football  Labor  Day  getaway  to  Camp  Randall  Stadium  and  the  University  of  Wisconsin,  and  it  was  awesome!  Not  quite  full  at  75,300+  fans  (on  9/1/2017),  but  ""  Jump  Around "" was  great (although  it  COULD   have  been  a  bit  longer!).........  UW  overcame  a  10-point  deficit and embarrassed  Utah  State  59-10.....The  UW  Band  was  excellent!   Some  of  the  fans  were  not  the  MOST  welcoming  (the  guy  next  to  me  in  Section  II  (eye-eye)  made  it  very  plain  that  HE  owned  bleacher  seat  #  8  in  our  row,  and  I  was  an  inch  or  two  over  into  his  area -  NOT  exactly  friendly!).  EVERYONE  wore  Wisconsin  gear  into  the  stadium  (on  a  slightly  chilly  night)......Overall,  we  had  a  great  time!  Would  not  recommend  bringing  young  kids  (some  of  the UW  students seated  behind  us  apparently  have  mastered  ONLY  the  use  of  four-letter  words  during  their  studies  at  UW).  A  typical,  but  excellent  college  football  venue,  marred  only  by  a  few  unpleasantries."
7149,Date of experience: September 2017,4-Sep-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Worth the visit to attend a game,"Amazing school spirit, UW is a football community and Badger Spirit is on display at games. Worth the visit!"
7150,Date of experience: October 2016,8-Aug-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Badger Sea of Red,"The fans at the Badger football are as entertaining as the team. You can get caught up in the human wave and the forth quarter ""Jump Around""."
7151,Date of experience: November 2016,8-Aug-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Go Big Red,Best atmosphere for football in the Big Ten.Great scoreboard and not abad sit in the stadium.Some bathrooms could be upgrade.
7152,Date of experience: October 2016,8-Aug-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,A home game against a quality Big Ten opponent in Camp Randall is the best college venue.,"The crowd gets excited and the ""jump around event"" at the beginning of the 4th Quarter is unparalleled in college football. That is worth going to the game alone. Because the stadium is on campus their is a lot of interaction with students to and from the game."
7154,Date of experience: October 2016,21-Jun-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Thrilling collegiate football experience,"The atmosphere, the fans, the fun, the stadium, jump around. It's one of the best. Go see it at least once."
7155,Date of experience: September 2016,24-May-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Gotta watch Badger football!!,The stadium is a must visit for UW Badger home games. Stay in your seats between the 3rd and 4th quarter for Jump Around and don't leave when the game is over to enjoy the UW band and the 5th quarter.
7157,Date of experience: October 2016,23-May-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,3,Catch a bus or walk to get here. Don't try to drive!,"The football is generally very good, the marching band is loud, the student section performs all of the expected antics (including cursing at each other in unison), and the stadium shakes before the 4th quarter when everyone takes ""Jump Around"" literally. Stick around for the 5th quarter at least once. Food is nothing special - standard stadium stuff - and if you're looking for a beer while you take in the Badgers, you won't find one here since they don't sell alcohol in the stadium."
7158,Date of experience: October 2016,21-May-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Nothing else like it,"Nothing Else like it once a civil-war camp Now one of the best College football stadiums in the country 1 of the hardest to play in right n4 the fourth quarter 80,000 plus people humor around the entire place shakes it's and amazing experience and a must do in life"
7160,Date of experience: November 2016,17-May-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,What an experience,Amazing place to watch a football game.  The jump around is fun.  Best atmosphere for college football. Stay for the 5th quarter.
7163,Date of experience: October 2016,15-May-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Badgers,"Great stadium in downtown Madison. It is very clean and easy to get to walking or using public transportation. Good food and drinks, and not a bad seat in the stadium."
7165,Date of experience: November 2016,24-Apr-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,"""On Wisconsin""","The first time I saw Camp Randall Stadium, home of the University of Wisconsin's football team, was in 1959 when I was a sophomore at the University of Illinois. I drove five other fraternity brothers to Madison, Wisconsin, to spend a weekend at our fraternity's Wisconsin chapter and watch the Illinois/Wisconsin football game. In those days, Camp Randall was small in comparison with Illinois' Memorial Stadium. Illinois won 9-6 before 56,028 but Wisconsin went on to win the Big 10 championship and earn a berth in the Rose Bowl, where they lost to Washington 44-8. But Camp Randall is a beautiful facility. Opened in 1917, it is the oldest and fifth largest stadium in the Big 10, having been expanded to 80,321 in 2014. It has great sight lines. I recall being so close to the field that we could hear the quarterback calling signals. Today, Camp Randall has undergone significant changes. In 2014, work was completed on several renovations and improvements, including additional seating in the north end, a new 4,217-square-foot scoreboard, academic and strength training facilities and locker rooms. The retired numbers of Wisconsin's two Heisman Trophy winners, Alan Ameche (35) and Ron Dayne (33) are displayed on the upper deck facade with the retired numbers of Elroy Hirsch (40), Dave Schreiner (80), Allen Schafer (83) and Pat Richter (88). A bronze statue of former coach and athletic director Barry Alvarez was unveiled in 2006 in the stadium's Kellner Plaza. A month later, a similar statue of Pat Richter, who also was a former athletic director, was unveiled. But the biggest change I noticed during my most recent visit to Camp Randall was the tradition called ""The Fifth Quarter."" In 1969, after the Badgers lost 24 games in a row, new marching band director Michael Leckrone and then athletic director Elroy Hirsch created a band event called ""The Fifth Quarter"" that took place at the end of the game. The band plays ""On Wisconsin"" and other songs with special choreography in which the band, cheerleaders and spectators all participate. At the end, the band plays ""Varsity,"" Wisconsin's alma mater, as the spectators sing. It's all part of a special football weekend at Camp Randall."
7166,Date of experience: October 2016,17-Apr-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Go Badgers,"Where else can you hear competing student sections launch verbal obscenities at each other while enjoying a top-notch football game? The ""jump around"" at the end of the third quarter shakes the stadium. Make sure you stay for the post-game fifth quarter to be entertained by the UW Band."
7167,Date of experience: November 2016,11-Apr-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,3,Sardines with good sightlines.,"I've been a U.W.Madison Football Season Ticket Holder since 1985. Even in the premium seating areas fans are shoehorned onto metal bench seating which must have been designed for Supermodels suffering from eating disorders. Since fans bring out all their cold weather gear as the season moves from September to late November, the cramped seating only get worse. In the past few years they have updated concessions and the scoreboards are state-of-the art. The student section is legendarily profane and rowdy and the marching band is the finest in the B1G Conference. The highlight of the day is the singing of Varsity at half time."
7168,Date of experience: October 2016,10-Apr-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Nothing compares,This is the greatest sporting venue in existence. Great fun for all. Pre game tailgating is a hoot. Head to Ian's for a slice or Mikey's Dairy Bar for breakfast. Don't forget to stick around for the 5th quarter!
7169,Date of experience: October 2016,10-Apr-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Badger footbal,"Great venue for  Badger football, the band, the game, the fifth quarter. Fun placeon a crisp autumn day in Wisconsin"
7170,Date of experience: November 2016,10-Apr-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Badger Football Games,"We enjoy watching UW Badger Football games. The Badger's football team have been very competitive. The energy the students, sitting in the student  section bring to the game is as good as it gets.  The UW marching band adds to  the "" college atmosphere "" . In addition, the song selection  played over the sound system  is also very enjoyable."
7171,Date of experience: November 2016,29-Mar-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Best Gameday Experience,"Been to many stadiums, and this is one of the best if not the best in the land. Awesome fan base, great team. Don't miss the jump around between the 3rd and 4th quarter - it's quite the sight."
7173,Date of experience: September 2016,13-Mar-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Best college game day,Been going to UW football games since I was a little kid.  Fun even when Badgers could not beat anyone ( yes.. used to suck). Nothing like jump around or the 5th quarter.  Band kicks butt.
7174,Date of experience: October 2016,13-Mar-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Nothing like  Big 10 football in October at Camp Randall,"There is nothing like watching a Big 10 football game at Camp Randall on a cool Saturday October afternoon. The energy in Camp Randall is special and if you are cold...just wait for the break between the 3rd and 4th quarter when you can ""Jump around"" with 80,000 of your closest friends. I would compare watching a football game at Camp Randall to the NFL equivalent to watching a Packer Game at Lambeau Field in Green Bay. You are guaranteed to go home with fond memories of a great experience."
7175,Date of experience: October 2016,13-Mar-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,IF YOU LOVE WISCONSIN AND SPORTS. THIS IS A PLACE YOU MUST VISIT!,"There is nothing like game day at Camp Randall Stadium. There are many activities around the stadium that you are able to enjoy. From bars, tailgate parties, to fun events for the family.  The people do get very intoxicated but it is part of the tailgate experience. The security is very good and you have nothing to worry about."
7176,Date of experience: October 2016,5-Mar-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Must see for a great game,The atmosphere is amazing for a college football game.  College game day is something to experience and see.  It is one of the best stadiums to visit.  Walk around the stadium before going in to see the game.  3rd Quarter jump around is awesome.
7177,Date of experience: October 2016,14-Feb-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,An amazing venue for game day,One of the best stadiums in the nation to watch college football. A historic landmark with several modern amenities. College game day is an all day event in Madison and crowds can get a bit rowdy (intoxicated) but security does a good job of keeping the experience safe.
7178,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Feb-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Must see,"UW Badger football. Saturday at 11am, 230pm or even the 6pm-7pm night game--all are equally good. To park look for someone's lawn near the stadium--you'll pay for it, but the in/out will be fast. The stadium itself needs updating (bathrooms and concessions) but if you are inside the stadium you are there for a football game, not for the bathrooms. Seating provides excellent views from virtually everywhere. 80,000 seats and very, very few are ""bad"". You will be able to see from anywhere."
7179,Date of experience: November 2016,12-Feb-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Badgers Bang Cornhuskers,"Camp Randall is a great place to see a college football game. The seats are open and there are no obstructed views.   It really helps if you are wearing red because you will fit in with 80,000 other fans all cheering for Bucky.  The jumbo screen is fantastic and there is nothing like the marching band performing at halftime.  Go Bog Red"
7180,Date of experience: October 2016,6-Feb-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Great place to catch a game - good fans,Really cool place to catch a game. We got some heckling around campus for our away team apparel but nothing out of line. For the most part the Badger fans were really respectful. I will go again for sure.
7181,Date of experience: November 2016,17-Jan-17,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Wisconsin/ Nebraska Football Gamr,"Great Stadium and nothing is more fun than the ""Jump Around"" at the end of the third quarter! The stadium just Rocks!!!!!"
7182,Date of experience: October 2016,31-Dec-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Game day experience,"I admittedly have not been to every Big 10 football field but I have been to Minneapolis and Ann Arbor.  Michigan can brag all they want about the ""big house"" but there is no way it is as good as Madison.  It's not only the in stadium experience it's what goes on out on the streets and in the bars around Camp Randall.  Out of town visitors always have fun and you will too."
7183,Date of experience: November 2016,22-Dec-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Every Seat Has a Good View,"There's nothing better than seeing the Badgers win at Camp Randall. We had seats in the corner next to the student section, all the better to participate in Jump Around. Great views. They could use a little better signage directing people to seats."
7184,Date of experience: August 2016,30-Nov-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Best football games ever,"Some of my best memories are from Camp Randall sharing the crazy antics of UW friends and alumni. College games are SOOO much more fun than professional games so if you possibly can, get tickets (although they are usually sold out.) Remember to wear red."
7185,Date of experience: November 2016,30-Nov-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,2,Lots of Police to Chaperone the Students,"There just aren't that many student sections anymore, probably because the students can't pay enough to support an expensive football program.The students that are there are herded in like cattle.  Student tickets don't specify a seat.  The students are lined up and forced to fill the seats from the bottom to the top, so it doesn't pay for them to get to the game on time.  Later in the game when students start leaving, the students higher up in the stands are forced down so that they stay nice and concentrated.  That is probably more convenient for the police.There is heavy police presence in the stadium, mostly in the student areas. It seemed like there was one police officer for every three students, but that probably an overstatement.  During the Civil War Camp Randall was a prison camp.  Just saying'.If you aren't a student the game experience is more or less ok."
7186,Date of experience: November 2016,28-Nov-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,One of the Best Venus Out There!,"Growing up around the area, I do have a little bit of a biased opinion on best sporting venues around, but when it comes to College Football, Camp Randall is one of the top.  With a great location in regards to campus living and off-campus living, and traditions that run deep, Camp Randall is a great place to take in a game.  If you are from out-of-town with another team, you might have a run-in with some unsavory college kids, but if you can get passed that, you should be in for a real treat."
7187,Date of experience: November 2016,27-Nov-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Go Badgers,This place becomes wonderful when there is American football being played there. Everyone dresses their red costume and go to the stadium.
7188,Date of experience: October 2016,16-Nov-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Just the best on a fall day,"Camp Randall should need a review. It's historic, it's impressive and the BADGERS play there. Love Love love the atmosphere, crowds, games.  Jump around is, of course, the best time!"
7189,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Nov-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Badger Football,Great place to watch a game. Go early and walk up Regent Street and take in all the excitement of game day. Tailgate or stop at one of the many bars for a brat and beer. Go Badgers!!!
7190,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Nov-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Memorable Football Experience,"Have been here multiple times for football games in the student section. Huge stadium, about every view from any section is worth the price for your ticket. Event staff is helpful when you need it. Overpriced food just like any other sporting event. Really wish they would invest in a dome for the stadium, much needed for cold Wisconsin weather! Great experience where everyone is showing off their Sconnie pride, so much fun whether Badgers win or lose!"
7191,Date of experience: October 2016,2-Nov-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,An Iconic Fotball Experience,"Attending a football game here is a memorable experience. Camp Randall is built on the location of a civil war camp and is one of the oldest stadiums in the Big Ten.Capacity is about 83,000 and the entire stadium is red for home Badger games."
7192,Date of experience: October 2016,2-Nov-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Bar far the Best Game day,"On Wisconsin.   If you are not a Badger Fan after just one visit to a Wisconsin Badger game you will be or at least be blown away with the event.   From jump around at the end of the 3rd quarter, to the band.  An experience you will never forget."
7193,Date of experience: October 2016,1-Nov-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Best College Game I have ever attended in the history of ever,"This game experience began just trying to get to the stadium. For about 8 blocks it would have been quicker just to walk. Every venue along the way was packed with fans. They incentivize bringing little to nothing by having express entries (not that you can really get in there fast) for those without bags. Although we sat in the upper tier,  the crowd noise was about as loud as Centurylink field in Seattle or University of Washington and way more electric. The entire stadium young and old knew all these songs ( I did not ) and they all had their flashlights on with their mobile devices on at one point. They sang ""Jump around"" after the third quarter and the entire concrete stadium was actually shaking under my feet. Absolutely surreal."
7194,Date of experience: October 2016,1-Nov-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,The atmosphere and culture make the experience,"Camp Randall was on my bucket list, and I was not disappointed! Let's start with parking - unless you want to pay $30 and up on someone's small front lawn, plan to get there VERY early, or walk about a mile. We had beautiful weather, so we hiked in from St Mary's hospital parking ramp, where we paid a total of $7 to park. Viewing fans and tailgate parties was an entertaining distraction on the way to the stadium. We did use a Google Maps app for walking directions to and from (drop a pin where you park and this will get you right back to where you started).Our family walked around the stadium concourse - a statement I make generally, as there is no direct route to do this - lots of ups and downs and a few times we questioned if we were headed the right direction. Lots of people - Lots, so if you have small children, hang on to them. You cannot rent stadium seats there - even though you will see them already put in place for season ticket holders who have leased theirs for the year. You are welcome to purchase one and use it - but be ready to pay. Like any good stadium, you are shoulder to shoulder crammed in, but it's all part of the experience. Be ready for variations of the wave - and go with it, unless you want to be ridiculed by the student section. And watch Bucky the mascot, who will do push ups to coincide with the score. This was a FUN family event - I'm very glad we went."
7195,Date of experience: October 2016,31-Oct-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great atmoshpere to see a game,I have attended many college football games and few compare t the atmosphere of a Badger game at Camp Randal.  There is nothing quite like feeling the stadium shake during Jump Around at the end of the 3rd quarter.
7196,Date of experience: October 2016,30-Oct-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Walk or bus in for easiest access to games!,"Easy to navigate stadium once inside. Expect major traffic by car. Lyft ride made for a short walk in. Seats in lower back section were good: B side, H70.  Best of all, at this, my firat Badger game, Wisconsin clobbered Nebraska in OT!!! Fun stadium and crowd made it an awesome experience!!!"
7197,Date of experience: October 2016,29-Oct-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Must go,"Even if you're not a University of Wisconsin Madison alum, camp Randall needs to be on your bucket list. Fans are fantastic, students can be colorful, football is great. Stay for the 5th Quarter, when the incomparable Wisconsin marching band plays. Always a winner"
7198,Date of experience: October 2016,29-Oct-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Gotta see a game here,First time here. Fun tailgating with Badger fans.  Electric environment for my beloved Huskers to bring home a victory?  Fifth quarter festivities and fortunately a nice night for a game.
7199,Date of experience: October 2016,26-Oct-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Seeing a Big en game is a must,"This is the home of the UW football team.  Seeing the team play here is a wonderful experience, not to be missed.  The spirit of the fans is amazing and do not leave before the game ends or you will miss the fifth quarter when the UW Band plays and then exits the stadium to march through the streets toward downtown."
7200,Date of experience: October 2016,23-Oct-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,No Better Place for. Football Game,"This historic, enormous stadium is a great place for a Fall football game. Came here for the Wisconsin Ohio State matchup, with a sad loss by the Badgers in overtime but nonetheless a great stadium.  Seats on bench are tiny and no beer is sold in the stadium (probably a wise decision), but no one cared. Interesting, historic landmark and stadium."
7201,Date of experience: October 2016,22-Oct-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Badgers Buckeye matchup - Fun,A game at Camp Randall is a must do for prospective students and families. It really captures the the essence of Madison. Good football too. Me beers served in the stadium but it's easy to get your share on the way.
7202,Date of experience: October 2016,21-Oct-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Nothing better on a Saturday!,Visiting this stadium is a must - it is in the heart of the university and a wonderful experience!   WI football is a must!
7203,Date of experience: October 2016,20-Oct-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Well equipped stadium,"Univ. of Wisconsin has a beautiful campus, including Camp Randall Stadium.  Great sound system (music) but hard to hear ref decisions, ample food and drink, friendly staff and fans (even when you're representing the opposing team).  If you're an out-of-towner -- highly recommend finding/paying for advanced parking relatively close to stadium.  Only found 1 ""same-day"" lot with avails, and while it had ""pay-for"" shuttle buses that made the trip to the stadium convenient -- there's no hope of a return shuttle bus (to parking) once the game ends and the traffic starts.  Waited in line for the shuttle for 1.25 hours, in the pouring rain/lightening, and ended up walking 25 min's, in torrential downpour, back to the car (thank you google maps).In the stadium we sat adjacent to the press box at the 40 yard line about 3/4 of the way to the top.  Great view -- easy access to food/washrooms.  The seats, however, are WAYYYYY to crammed together.  Was nice that the seats we bought came with cushions to sit on -- but your knees are literally in the back of the person in front of you.  And don't let me get started on what happens if you're seated at the end of the row.  Must've had to stand up to let others by, to get to their seats, no less than 100 times during the game (and I'm not exaggerating).  I'm a small person and it drove me crazy.  Imagine my 6'5"" husband.  Still -- a very beautiful and hospitable place.  The seat situation would not keep me from visiting again (the next time OSU plays Wisconsin). Go Bucks!"
7204,Date of experience: October 2016,19-Oct-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,WI vs OSU,"What a great game.  Tough loss for the Badgers.  Amid a heated rivalry game, fans were polite all around."
7205,Date of experience: November 2015,18-Oct-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,There's no place like home!,"Ah, Badger Land!  Camp Randall is THE BEST COLLEGE FOOTBALL STADIUM ANYWHERE!  The atmosphere is electric!  So much fun!"
7206,Date of experience: October 2016,17-Oct-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Ohio State Game,Well organized and secured the field directly after game due to weather.....but really.....dump us out into the street with lightning in the area.....Gee thanks!BTW why can't you have railings all the way up the stairs....people were pushing on the way down from the top and it WAS NOT SAFE!!!!!!!
7207,Date of experience: October 2016,17-Oct-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Exciting Place for a Game,"We attend the OSU vs. UW football game.  The place was electric.  In addition to the game, there are loads of different food choices."
7208,Date of experience: October 2016,16-Oct-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,OSU vs Wisconsin football,Great place to watch a college football game! Literally right dab in the middle of campus. Great game day atmosphere
7209,Date of experience: October 2016,16-Oct-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,wisonsin vs Ohio State,"fun and exciting1  jump around,tubas fifth quarter, shuttle bus cheerleaders BUCKY and of course the game!"
7210,Date of experience: October 2016,16-Oct-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Great place to watch a game,We went last night to watch the Badgers vs Buckeyes game.  The stadium is old but well kept.  The two main issues I had were there were no lights on the stairs when we left which was very dangerous and they REALLY pack in the people.  I've been to lots of college stadiums and the bench per butt ratio here is the smallest I've even seen.
7211,Date of experience: October 2016,16-Oct-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Jump around and great time,"Saw the Buckeyes play Wisky and had a great time.  Loved being at camp Randall at a night game.  Everyone friendly except for the occasional drunk and obnoxious immature - anus dressed in a lobster suit.  He left quickly post game.  Fun time for out of towners and found close parking with waze app.Hit the ""old fashioned"" for dinner at the bar the night before, had a Spotted cow beer and made friends.  Pre game we were hungry and hung out a little at Rocco 's pizza.  Great time and thanks badger fans!"
7212,Date of experience: October 2016,16-Oct-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Good but not the Best in B1G,"We attend one away Ohio State football game each year. We were excited for a top 10 matchup vs. Wisconsin at night...hoping it would be the best trip to date. The atmosphere was alive with a loyal following of Badger fans and two big time teams going toe-to-toe, blow for blow.  We had a great time tailgating all day on Saturday with some friendly Badger fans pregame. Then we walked an easy mile to the stadium, on a bike path, which was packed, but ready for a crowd (unlike Northwestern and Rutgers).  We were pumped to feel the stadium shake for Jump Around, but it did not live up to the hype. It was cool, but didn't shake like Penn State did at a whiteout night game two years earlier.  We were excited to stay for the 5th quarter after an epic OT thriller (Buckeye win), but it was cancelled due to lightning.  I will say that I was warned about the possibility of obnoxious Wisconsin fans, but everyone we encountered on Friday and Saturday was a pleasure.  Coming from a Buckeye fan, I realize that is the pot calling the kettle... but that is a small minority of over zealous fans. In fact, the only idiot fan I encountered all weekend got up in my face and yelled ""Ohio State sucks...Go Blue!""   I think he was kicked out of Ann Arbor or was simply lost in Madison.  We had a great experience in Madison. I told my wife I could see our daughters attending UW."
7214,Date of experience: September 2016,30-Sep-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Good old college football experience,"Great time at this historic venue.  Easy in, bit harder to exit, but what's to be expected with 80,000 fans. Stay for the '5th quarter'  band goes on field for 20 minutes of raucous  fun."
7215,Date of experience: September 2016,27-Sep-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Nothing like Big Ten Pageantry!,"In town for a University of Wisconsin football game, we put on our red shirts and walked to Camp Randall stadium on a gorgeous fall day. There??s nothing like the Big Ten football game for over-the-top pageantry. The 300-member Wisconsin marching band is justifiably famous for both musicality and precision maneuvers, plus cheerleaders, pep squad, Bucky Badger, smoke cannon, and boistrosity."
7216,Date of experience: September 2016,25-Sep-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,The holy land!,This is my favorite sports venue in all of the US. Great atmosphere! Great sportsmanship! Every seat is a good seat. If you have a chance to go with ought the kids I would highly recommend the student section if you are looking for a classic college experience. On Wisconsin!!!
7217,Date of experience: September 2016,25-Sep-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Great Experience,Went to a game with my 13 year old and had a wonderful time with 72 degrees and blue sky. An older stadium but it meets all the needs and pretty much all the seats have a good view. If you with adults go early and partake in one of the many parking lot parties put on by the local pubs. Several good student sponsored activities     Within walking distance. Worth going at least once. If you drive yourself the capital is close by for a walk around the park.
7218,Date of experience: September 2016,24-Sep-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Best Fans and Clean and Friendly Stadium!,This has to be the best fans I have ever seen! The entire town is wearing red for there team wether you are in the stadium or not.. the events going on around the stadium are so fun! Everyone is friendly and happy and highly suggest!
7220,Date of experience: August 2016,20-Sep-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Interesting visit,We were going to try to walk on the campus but it is spread out over blocks and couldn??t find exactly where to park.  So we decided to check out the stadium.  We stopped and asked a student and she directed us to a parking garage on the back of the stadium.  Then we walked around the entire outside of the stadium to find a way in just to get to the front and see that There is free parking in the front where the gift shop and an eatery are located.  We also found out that if you park in the garage you can walk through a thoroughfare and get to the front as well.The gift shop is large and is at the beginning of Badger Alley and both are located under the stadium seating. Badger Alley is very nice usage of the concession area under the grandstands in the concession way.  It displays 3D posters with a brief summary of coaches and players records to tell the history of the stadium.   At the end of the Alley is a small eatery.There did happen to be a doorway open so we could take a peak at the field and stands but could not actually go into the stadium.  All was very clean and larger than expected.  We did see parking in the front of the stadium so you can visit the gift shop and Badger alley rather than parking in the garage.  We were glad we took the time to check it all out.
7221,Date of experience: September 2016,19-Sep-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Touchdown,Beautiful place to watch football. Fast and free WiFi. Parking is quite challenging but make sure to be there early to get a good parking spot.
7222,Date of experience: September 2016,18-Sep-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,2,"Concession food prices ridiculous for marginal food, smaller portions each year.","Have been to many, many games over past 25 years.....Greed of UW athletic department just keeps getting worse and fans continue to pay the price but I and others have cut back because it just never ends... Prices are ridiculous for food and everything related to what should be an enjoyable experience....No snacks or water allowed in so they can screw everyone extensively.... every year it gets worse.... .  this year the water is no longer spring water, it's $4.00 for a bottle of ""purified"" tap water... the hot dogs are smaller now but still high priced...."
7223,Date of experience: September 2016,18-Sep-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great football vemue,"Camp Randall stadium is one of those football stadiums that all football fans need to attend at least once in their lives.The stadium has a lot of history and the fans are great.Plenty of tradition in the stands and on the field as well, with Bucky leading the cheers!  Don't forget to stay for the 5th quarter, and to Jump Around after the 3rd!"
7224,Date of experience: September 2016,17-Sep-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,GSU Panthers Visit Camp Randall,"Beautiful day for football. Wonderful historic football stadium. Fans are very passionate about their Badgers, but were very hospitable. Enjoy the architecture and traditions when you visit. Good selection of stadium food."
7225,Date of experience: September 2016,17-Sep-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,A sea of red,Badger games are very special. It is a sea of red everywhere both in and around the stadium.   Everyone tail gates a few hours before the game.  Parking in the surrounding area is 20-25 depending on where you are.  Even as far as Edgewood.  The stadium is clean.  The sell the normal eats. The inspect your bags going in so hard to sneak a beverage in but they did not seam to mind walking in with a bottle of water.  The fans are fun and watching the student section is a treat. Especially third quarter jump around.  Don't forget your sun block. Easy to get a burn sitting in the sun for that long.  On Wisconsin.
7226,Date of experience: September 2016,13-Sep-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,One of the Best Days Ever!,"So much to do and see! Whether it be the students singing Buttercup, Bucky the Badger doing push ups, the Marching Band high stepping on the field, cheerleaders performing gravity defying tosses, the entire crowd ""jumping"", or the main reason for the visit - Big 10 Football - the experience is unforgettable."
7227,Date of experience: October 2015,13-Sep-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,One of the best college football venues hands down!,"Plan an awesome football Satuday.Go early to find parking (or prepay - maybe combine with one of many tailgating offers)Don't miss stopping for a beer at one of Regent St bars, then go for some brats & cheese curds before entering the stadium.Check to see where the band will be before the game - it is now a tradition to start at Union South along with Bucky, so don't miss that...  :)Between 3rd and 4th quarter is the ""jump around"" where the entire stadium shakes to jumping spectators-a UW Madison classic!And don't forget to stick around for 5th quarter band show-also a mustIf late October or later bundle up according to weather - it's ALWAYS colder than you think.  :)"
7228,Date of experience: October 2015,13-Sep-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Fun and fantastic atmosphere!,"I have been attending football games here literally since I was a baby, and it's a GREAT place to watch a college or even professional football game, as I watched a Packer game here once!"
7229,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Best Stadium for College Football,"From the Star Spangled Banner through Jump Around after the third quarter and a big finish with the traditional fifth quarter with the best marching band in the country, Badger game day at Camp Randall is unequalled. Did I forget to mention excellent football as well? Don't miss an opportunity to see some of the best play in this special place."
7230,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Penultimate college football experience,"Ok, I am a 1984 Badger grad, so I am biased.  My first visit since the stadium upgrade, and it was significant.  The catacombs beneath the seating offer all amenities and likely good shelter on nasty days, and there ample TVs around to keep one in the game.   Sky boxes are impressive, but who needs that?  There really is not a bad seat in the place and the jumbotron really helps to keep your focus on the field.  I sat behind the alumni band in south end zone, and it is almost as big as the student band.  Great energy and entertainment.  The students seem better behaved than 35 years ago.  We took Uber to get in and out of campus, and it made it so much more tolerable."
7231,Date of experience: September 2016,11-Sep-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Best Football experience,"We hold season tickets to Badger games, and of all of the stadiums we have been too this is by far the best environment to watch a football game. You can't get it on TV. You have to be there. You can feel the excitement. The game, the rivalries, the fifth quarter and of course Jump Around make this the best place to be on a fall Saturday."
7232,Date of experience: September 2015,31-Aug-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Awesome Facility and located downtown,This is an awesome facility that you should visit.  Visitors are treated well.  Bars located across the street. Parking is the downfall as you have to park a way away.
7233,Date of experience: October 2015,22-Aug-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Football,This is one of my favorite venues for football. There is so much crowd interaction and you can't beat the greatest jump around!
7234,Date of experience: October 2015,12-Aug-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Always a good time,We are season ticket holders and always look forward to game day.  Facilities are awesome and the atmosphere is best in the USA
7236,Date of experience: November 2015,26-Jul-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Best stadium in the BIG 10!,"For a fun and exciting place for college football, you can't beat Camp Randall.  Lots of energy at the Badger football games.  The UW Marching Band is awesome to watch as well."
7237,Date of experience: September 2015,25-Jul-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,The best location to catch a football game,"Until moving to the western US we held season football tickets for years. Loved the experience and every game. Best location that I have ever been to for a football game. Lots of activity, fun environment. Food is way overpriced but that is typical for stadiums."
7238,Date of experience: November 2015,13-Jul-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,One of the best college football game day experiences,"Camp Randall is a great place to see a college football game.  The crowd is engaged, there are a lot of fun places to go for a pre-game beverage, and it is a lovely part of campus.  One caveat:  if you're rooting for the visiting team, sometimes the fan experience is unpleasant, sadly.  Badger fans are loyal, sometimes to a fault.  But, I've also seen visiting fans treated with fun and respect, too."
7239,Date of experience: September 2015,27-Jun-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great stadium and city for visiting fans,We have made an effort to travel to all of the Big 10 stadiums.  This was a great start to the journey.  The 3rd Quarter Jump Around only highlighted the rest of this historic stadiums appeal.

Been coming here for years not a bad sit in the house , watch the Badgers and the Packers play here ! Saw The Rolling Stones , Pink Floyd , and my best band ever was U2 , Will never forget the shows here ! Also great food , best cheese curds ever !"
7243,Date of experience: November 2015,5-Jun-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Tom,What a great place to watch a football game. The upgrades such the new scoreboard last season have made it more fan friendly while keeping all the tradition of one the oldest NCAA stadiums in the country. All Big Ten schools great pageantry and UW does not disappoint with great band performance before during and after the game. Students can and do get vulgar which does hurt the university's image.
7245,Date of experience: October 2015,25-May-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,This is where Bucky shines!! Fun for ANY age!,"There is not a bad seat in the stadium and during football season, dress warmer than normal because the wind can get quite chilly, especially if you are seated under a deck. Plenty of opportunities to take kids to family events but the cr??me de la cr??me are the Badger Football games--here is where you feel the University spirit, camaraderie and joviality of truly great fans of all ages..."
7246,Date of experience: November 2015,24-May-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Great Game Day Experience,"The game day experience at Camp Randall is second to none. I have gone to college games in more than 20 major stadiums and the atmosphere is the best in the country. Unfortunately the outdated seats are way too small and very, uncomfortable; so I can not rate it excellent."
7247,Date of experience: September 2015,1-May-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Sacred Land of The University of Wisconsin!,A great storied stadium to watch the Badger Band and Football team !  Once you go to a game you will want to go again.  The fans are the best in the Big Ten.  Get the Red out and go!
7248,Date of experience: October 2015,27-Apr-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Football Game at Camp Randall,"Great facility.  Fans are great.  You have to love when everyone sings ""Build Me Up Buttercup"".  Too much fun!"
7251,Date of experience: November 2015,21-Apr-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great fans!,Been to many home football games! Love the jump around song! Great band and fun student section that gets the entire crowd into the wave!! Fun!
7252,Date of experience: October 2015,20-Apr-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,3,It is a football stadium.,This is a modern if utilitarian sporting venue.  the seats are hard and the bathrooms barely adequate.  The fans are not as obnoxious as other schools but on their way.  (They forget the down years of the 1970s and 80s....)Makes you wonder about spending all the money to maintain a venue like this that hosts 10 events a year....
7253,Date of experience: September 2015,6-Apr-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Exciting Atmosphere,"Fun, entertaining, and very high energy! Loved watching the Badgers play and cannot wait to see upcoming seasons!"
7255,Date of experience: October 2015,23-Mar-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Go Bucky!,"Camp Randall, the home of the WI Badgers, is where you will find most of Madison on football Saturday's. Set in one of the city's most charming neighborhoods, it is adjacent to Monroe St. with its cafes, boutiques and art galleries not to mention my favorite hair salon, Baci. On the morning of a home game, the entire area is transformed into a sea of red, lawns double as parking lots, and tailgate parties get started. The best attraction, by far, however is the game. There is no bad seat as there is as much going on in the stands as on the field. Football fan or not, it's a great way to spend a Fall Saturday in Madison."
7256,Date of experience: October 2015,17-Mar-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Awesome college atmosphere,"We had season tickets for UW football for more than 40 years.  We are now in our 70s and decided to give up our season tickets.  However we still go to an occasional game if the weather is good and the game is during the day.  There is an energy and excitement in that place.  The band is awesome and the spirit squad full of energy.  The rows are close together and can be crowded if you are in the middle of a row and have to get out during a game.  Bathrooms have been remodeled and have plenty of stalls with minimal waiting time.  Food options are varied.  Our first tickets were in the upper deck and I did not like the steepness.  We have not been in the upper deck for many years.  The student section is lively and other then their obscene chant which occurs occasionally, we'll behaved.  I have never been to a stadium that does the wave as well as Camp Randall.  There is tremendous history around Camp Randall.  I love it!"
7257,Date of experience: October 2015,15-Mar-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Badger Football - Jump Around,There is not a better venue to experience college football. Great tailgating and the famous Jump Around at the end of the third quarter.
7258,Date of experience: November 2015,6-Mar-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Game day experience second to none in college football!  And better than many NFL venues.,"Game day at Camp Randall!  Nuff said.  Congenial, friendly gameday experience for the novice or veteran attendee.  Exciting football, halftime, and 5th Quarter.  So what if half the crowd stopped somewhere before the game started?  They are still fun and friendly."
7259,Date of experience: October 2015,20-Feb-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Badger Game,"This stadium may be old, but it is renovated. Seating can be a pain in the bleachers, but the ambiance of this place is second to none. Love tailgating."
7260,Date of experience: September 2015,9-Feb-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Football road trip,There is a lot of history here. Game days are so much different in the North compared to the South. Fans are passionate and loud yet do to much sitting. A great variety of concessions are available.
7261,Date of experience: October 2015,8-Feb-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Best football experience with lots of good memories,A great place to enjoy football and the crowd experience. A good all-day experience for the whole family
7262,Date of experience: September 2015,8-Feb-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,3,Having been to other college stadiums I think this is just average,"Having been to other college stadiums I think this is just average - parking is a nightmare mainly because this college is in a ""city"""
7263,Date of experience: September 2015,26-Jan-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,THE BEST TIME YOU WILL EVER HAVE!,If you want a life experience then do yourself a favor and go see a Wisconsin Badgers football game. If it is an early game at noon then be prepared to go get a Blood Mary at 8:30AM and start the party. The bars open really early and stay open well after the game. No words that I can say will give the experience inside the stadium any justice. Be prepared for a great and memorable time!
7264,Date of experience: September 2015,20-Jan-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great place for football,If you ever get a chance to attend a Badger game at Camp Randall you will understand why many national publications tout it as the best place for college football in the country. You will not be disappointed. Everything from the pre-game activities around the stadium to the 5th Quarter by the band is top shelf. Oh... did I mention that you will be treated to some really good football in-between as well.
7265,Date of experience: September 2015,14-Jan-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Expect a mixed experience-but go,"A Badger,football, home game has its pluses and minuses.  On the plus side: the excitement and fun of Big Ten football-team,band, fans in a great stadium. On the minus side: parking is problem, seat room is small, and students loudly ""cheer"" offensively. The University has addressed the vulgar language, but it remains a problem-just be aware before you go.   Go Big Red!"
7266,Date of experience: September 2015,2-Jan-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great venue to watch a game!,"We have attended football games at many locations, including Lambeau, and thew Camp Randall game day experience  compares favorably with all of them.  Do not leave early--you will miss the Badger Band's excellent fifth Quarter and then you will want to slap yourself.  Stay, and let the traffic leave while you are enjoying a great band puttong on a great show."
7267,Date of experience: September 2015,1-Jan-16,Big Ten,Wiscosin,1,What a horrible place,"The seats are so small that a normal human being can't be accommodated, much less one who has any kind of fall/winter gear.  Parking is abominable.  You couldn't drag me back to this place."
7268,Date of experience: November 2015,28-Dec-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,One of my best experience in college life,It's really excited to watch a game in Camp Randall. Never miss the chance to watch a football game and become a badger fan!

7270,Date of experience: November 2015,15-Dec-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Full of history and excitment,"The gate 7 entry still had the original camp entry stone archer.  You can still feel the old camp walking down the tree line after entering the gate.  Once you are in the stadium, you would not disappoint by the badger fans cheering for their beloved home team. Great place to know something about Madison, Wisconsin"
7271,Date of experience: November 2015,15-Dec-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Football Saturdays are a Madison highlight,"I'm an alum and have been to many, many Badger games at Camp Randall stadium.  They are great fun, whether the Badgers win or lose, always plenty of music, pageantry., and brats. Well worth your time."
7272,Date of experience: September 2015,15-Dec-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,"The VERY best BIG TEN and college football has to offer.Great fan base, huge homefield advantage.",Wisconsin fans are very polite to the visiting team and fans. Many new restrooms and concession stands.
7273,Date of experience: October 2015,12-Dec-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great place to watch the Badgers win,"If you are in Madison, this is a reason to be here.  Tickets can usually be had (even right in front of the stadium they sell them), and if you stay, stay for the 5th quarter!"
7274,Date of experience: October 2015,11-Dec-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Awesome Badger game - Camp Randall filled to capacity,"Six of us went to a Badger football game in October and it was amazing. The weather was great and there was electricity is in the air. The band, cheerleaders and team were great. You'll never experience anything like ""jump around"" in your life. We stayed for the fifth quarter and watch the band perform and then happened upon them outside the stadium giving a performance to the students. We walked with them through the Camp Randall arch and had a blast. A must do if you are in Madison."
7275,Date of experience: October 2015,6-Dec-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Badger Football - Experience the college game,"Everyone in Wisconsin, and visiting competitors should want to visit Camp Randall. It is a great college atmosphere. The stadium is policed well and conduct is kept in check. The students, alumni, and fans all have fun and the bars around the stadium are always packed and fun loving as well."
7276,Date of experience: October 2015,25-Nov-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Best Place to Watch a Football Game,"All seats in the stadium give you a great view of the field.  On game day the crowd is great!  Watching the student section dance to ""Jump Around"" and the band play makes the day complete.  Stadium food is good. The PA system is good."
7277,Date of experience: November 2015,21-Nov-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,High School Football Playoffs brought us here. What a Beautiful Place!,"My companion and I spent part of the day watching the high school football playoffs,  returning the same night for a 7:05 p.m. game. To see the stadium in daylight is one thing but at night it is beautiful.  I did not check out  or use the restrooms. But I did get some munchies at the food places. A bit expensive for a cup of coffee $4.00.Also there are steps so if you have  a crutch or wheelchair good luck. Most of the seats are padded and the teletrons all over let you view the plays well.We used the hotel shuttle to get here so I don't have any review on the parking situation. There did not see to be  much of it. Still, it seems a great place to watch football."
7278,Date of experience: October 2015,16-Nov-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Always a great time!,"Bucky, Badgers and Beer (but not at the stadium, of course). You'll get your fill of all of it on Game Day!"

It's Time to Jump Around!,"Going to games at Camp Randall Stadium has been a huge highlight of my college experience at UW-Madison. It's great to be a fan, jump around, and cheer on the Badgers. If you are around the college age, see if you can get one of the elusive tickets into the student section. It's the best place to watch the game!"
7281,Date of experience: October 2015,13-Nov-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,GO BADGERS,"There is no experience better than going to a Badger Football game.  Wisconsin fans are the best.  Anyone who has not attended a game, must try to go next season."
7283,Date of experience: October 2015,29-Oct-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Badgers!,This stadium is awesome. Great place to see a football game in the fall. The seats are close together and not a lot of leg room between isles but Jump Around makes up for all of it.
7284,Date of experience: October 2015,27-Oct-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Camp Randall Stadium,"Home of the Wisconsin badger football team.  If you have never been to a home Badger football game, you need to go.  An experience like non other while attending an NCAA event.  The forth quarter ""Jump Around"" is something to see on a video but when you  are there and the stadium is shaking, you get to feel the excitment."
7285,Date of experience: November 2014,27-Oct-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Home to lots of fun,One of the best college football teams in the nation plays here and should be seen by anybody that has the chance.
7286,Date of experience: October 2015,26-Oct-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Go Badgers!,"Took the kids to their first Badger game for Homecoming and was very impressed by all the changes to Camp Randall. It looks great. The new scoreboard is certainly a vast improvement over the old one. The concessions were very good, if a little pricey. I'd love to see the UW upgrade from the old metal bench seating, but I guess some traditions are here to stay. But overall, a great experience for a couple of future Badgers!"
7287,Date of experience: October 2015,23-Oct-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Wonderful Experience,"A terrific place!  If you have a chance to catch a game at Camp Randall, make sure that you do.  You will not soon forget Jump Around (quite honestly overrated) or the Wave (quite honestly, underrated) from the crowd, especially the student section.""First Down, Wisconsin"""
7288,Date of experience: October 2015,21-Oct-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Big Ten College Football @ Its Best,"This was our 2nd time to attend a Badger game. From the pre game, marching to the stadium behind the band, the ocean of red across the stadium, to half time and the famous 5th quarter, this is an all day adventure no matter what time the game starts. Badgers know how to throw a party and call it a football game. Put it on your bucket list."
7289,Date of experience: October 2015,21-Oct-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,How can you rate Camp Randall Stadium???,"If you are a Wisconsin student, alum, or family of an alum, you can't help but say CRS is fantastic."
7290,Date of experience: October 2015,20-Oct-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great for Football Game!,Recently went to the homecoming Badgers game and had a blast.  Definitely worth buying tickets if there is a home game.
7291,Date of experience: September 2015,20-Oct-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Jump Around!,I've been to 20 NFL stadiums and 7 College and Camp Randall does not disappoint at all.  A young fan to one in their 80's can enjoy the game and game day experience here which was evident when the 4th Quarter started and everyone danced to Jump Around.
7292,Date of experience: October 2015,18-Oct-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,3,What fun!  Great day for a Badger game!,"The atmosphere is outstanding!   Fun! Fun! Fun!   But lets get to comfort.   They pack you in.   Each person has 14"" of butt space, if you sit in front of someone tall their knees will be jabbing your back.   Good thing you can stand, cheer and do the jump around.  Bathroom are 10 stalls for Women for a while section.   They serve soda without covers, I saw 2 people get dumped on!  But you cant deny the fun!"
7293,Date of experience: September 2015,18-Oct-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Go Bucky,Best place to see a game and tailgate prior to the game.  Park anywhere around the stadium and you'll thank me as this is the best party in the state.
7294,Date of experience: September 2015,14-Oct-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,You've got to experience at least once,I've been fortunate to experience Camp Randall a number of times. The best times are when the Badgers are playing Big 10 rivals. Older patrons might want to bring a cushion and a seat back. It's always great to see the colorful student section filing in after game start. Concessions are what you would expect for the Midwest. And stay for the famous UW Band Fifth Quarter celebration!
7295,Date of experience: September 2015,7-Oct-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,great place for a badger game,love watching a game here and the band not crazy about the rude student section but hay there a bunch of none respectful idiots
7296,Date of experience: October 2015,5-Oct-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Wisconsin-Iowa Game,Not a bad seat in this place really.  One of the the better in-game atmospheres in the Big Ten thanks to the student section.  Although I was very surprised by how slowly the student section filled in.  They need to work on the security procedures for the students so the stadium can be full by kickoff.  Otherwise a great place to watch a game!
7297,Date of experience: October 2015,5-Oct-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Jump around!,A great place for a game!  I don't remember the last time I saw RC cola anywhere on tap but the loaded mac and cheese was unexpected.Dress warm and have fun!
7298,Date of experience: October 2015,4-Oct-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Nice Stadium,One of the oldest stadiums in the country but still very nice.  Lots of seats and a great environment for watching football!
7299,Date of experience: October 2015,4-Oct-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Hawkeyes vs Badgers,"Nice venue. First time visit. Enjoyed learning the history of Camp Randall. Food, beverage areas  were great and the toilets were just fine. The activities out side of the stadium were fantastic. We visitors were treated great. Parking was good and we stayed till the end of the game and we were out and on our way in  min from leaving the stadium. Great road trip."
7300,Date of experience: October 2015,4-Oct-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Camp Randall,A great venue. Went to the Union South before the game. The band was there and they were awesome. A must be for pre game.........................................................................................
7301,Date of experience: September 2015,30-Sep-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,First night game at Camp Randall,We have been to many football games at Camp Randall now as our daughter is a senior now at UW. We went to the Badger-Hawaii game last weekend for our first night game there and it was awesome as usual. This is the VERY BEST place to watch a college football game - bar none! There is so much to do prior to and after the game and the history of this place along with the many traditions and shenanigans going on in the student section make it a very fun and memorable experience.
7303,Date of experience: September 2015,29-Sep-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Excellent college football venue,"Cant go wrong by attending a UW Badgers football game here. Be sure to stay for the 5th quarter, which is when the UW Marching band will entertain you for 15 more minutes.Only drawback is good seats are usually sold out. Best to know someone with season tickets."
7304,Date of experience: September 2015,29-Sep-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Football heaven,"Have now been to Camp Randall three times to see football games and it is quite an experience.  Caught the Hawaii game along with nearly 81,000 other fans all decked out in red.  The atmosphere is wonderful and Jump Around (after the third quarter) is a wonderful tradition.  Tons of tailgating prior to the game.We were very high up in the stadium and the walk up the many ramps can be taxing if you are older or have mobility issues.  I believe there is an elevator somewhere but I didn't see it.  No handrails in the higher reaches which could be a problem for some as well."
7306,Date of experience: September 2015,28-Sep-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,"Red, Loud, Proud and College Footballs best venue.","The ultimate College football experience, from the first notes of On Wisconsin, to the frenetic and well choreographed student sections, to the unmatched excitement of ""Jump Around"" and the 5th Quarter, you cannot go wrong with a game day visit to the home of The University of Wisconsin Badgers. Oh yeah, they have a pretty good football team too!"
7307,Date of experience: September 2015,28-Sep-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,A Bucket List Must!,"Never disappointed with a visit to Camp Randall!  This was the first time we didn't have seats behind the endzone, but even sitting way up in section HH we enjoyed the game and loved being able to see everything on the field.  One of the best places to watch college football (if not THE BEST)."
7308,Date of experience: September 2015,28-Sep-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Go Badgers! Excellent Venue for Football,"Badger football games are the best! Crowd management on game days is typically well organized. If you park in an area where you don't have to ""buck"" traffic to head home, that is highly recommended. Otherwise, you may have trouble winding your way around the stadium to go in the other direction. Fans also stay for the 5th quarter after the game; you avoid some of the immediate traffic if you hang around for a bit and watch the UW band play."
7309,Date of experience: September 2015,28-Sep-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Badgers v. Hawai'i,"There is no better place to enjoy a college football game than Camp Randall Stadium in Madison, Wisconsin. Tailgating, jump around after the third quarter,  and of course the 5th quarter by the UW Band."
7310,Date of experience: September 2015,28-Sep-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Not to be missed,"An incredible experience.  A sea of red, a lot of enthusiasm from student section.  A not to be missed experience"
7311,Date of experience: September 2015,27-Sep-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Its tradition!,"This is one of those things you need to experience at least once. If you like college football, than this is cool. The crowd is always into the game. Alumni showing is incredible. Band is always a special addition. The band students run around and toot there horns. People in general are polite, I never had a bad experience. Its just plain traditional. The only drawback is the bench seats. Sometimes it's pretty cramped. Try the hot chocolate during a cold game. Its great. Go Bucky!!"
7312,Date of experience: September 2015,19-Sep-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,3,"Decent Atmosphere, Lots Potential","My buddy and I over recent years travel around to different college football games, so we have lots to compare with. Overall this was not bad, but felt somewhat transactional Madison, lake, capital walk was very nice. Tailgating pretty much non existent, been to 10x better here at Big Sky games. Stadium nice, but disappointed that probably 1/5 student section empty. Jump Around pretty cool, but not quite like Metallica Sand Man at V Tech"
7313,Date of experience: September 2015,16-Sep-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great Fun!,Love going to Badger games! Our kids have always enjoyed going to Camp Randall to watch the football games each fall! It started as  a family day when the kids were young. Then as students the fun continued! Great for all ages...young and old!
7314,Date of experience: September 2015,15-Sep-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Jump around,Badgers blow out Miami 58-0. The football game was not very entertaining. Jump around and the 5th were the best part of the day.
7315,Date of experience: September 2015,14-Sep-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,No Place Better in the B10,"I took my kids to their first football game this weekend to say the Badgers take on Miami (OH).  The weather was great and they had a fantastic time.  Food is excellent, particularly for a stadium/arena, the views were nice, and the crowd/music got my kids into the game.  Make sure you get there early... it's amazing to walk around the stadium in the neighborhood with the students/alumni.  Also, plan on staying after the game when the band plays their hits... singing and dancing will happen.  The Fifth Quarter is a blast.    One thing to note... if you want to avoid hearing some strong language, avoid the student sections (K-P in the northwest corner).  It doesn't bother me and I know the kids have heard worse anyways, but I know that some people are less liberal about these things."
7316,Date of experience: September 2015,13-Sep-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Put It On Your Bucket List,"Camp Randall consistently ranks among America's best venues for college football.If you have an opportunity, make the effort to attend a Badger game.  Crowd participation is great and the students are actively into the game even though they, disappointingly, usually do not arrive until well into the second quarter and then leave early if the game is beyond reach.  Shame on them!!!  Drinking is more important.  As an alum, I find this part of the studant behavior poor.  Stay around after the game fot the Fifth Quarter.  Enjoy!!!"
7317,Date of experience: September 2015,13-Sep-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Best college gameday anywhere,"What more can be said about this great college football experience? I marched with the Wisconsin Alumni Marching Band, having a great time reliving the excitement of entertaining the throngs of red clad fans.The neighborhood around the stadium on game day is buzzing with yard parties which seem to start at sunrise. Parking can be tough, so plan ahead. Go Bucky!"
7318,Date of experience: September 2015,12-Sep-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Sea Of Red,"No better place for college football.  Beyond the fun and excitement of being at a Wisconsin Badgers Football game, the stadium was very clean and felt safe for families.  The marching band in the stands and the ""Wisconsin Tubas"" gave that college feel that you don't get at professional games.  Go Badgers!!!"
7319,Date of experience: September 2015,12-Sep-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great game!!,"Very good time! Enjoyed the Great game, the band with over 300 alumni. And the best part....Jump Around. Can't leave a game without Jump Around. Also a dry stadium so no drunks to deal with"
7320,Date of experience: October 2014,7-Sep-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great place for college football,"Even if you are not rooting for the Badgers, Camp Randall on game day is just an amazing experience.

7327,Date of experience: November 2014,13-Aug-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Great game day experience,Camp Randall is one of the iconic stadiums in college sports.The game day experience is definitely one of the best.The fans are friendly and the spirit contagious.The only negative is the seating. try to get a seat with a cushion.
7329,Date of experience: October 2014,29-Jul-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Badger Football at It's Best!,"There is no football game more fun than watching the Badgers at Camp Randall Stadium!  Stay for the 5th Quarter, if you don't know what it is, you are missing a great time.  The band plays great songs and marches on the field, dancing, celebrating and having fun.  Camp Randall Stadium has good seating, decent food and nothing beats watching college football players competing at the top of their games - regardless of who they are playing."
7330,Date of experience: October 2014,29-Jul-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Go Big Red,"There is absolutely no better college atmosphere anywhere.  Get the red out and get ready to really get your money's worth of entertainment on a football Saturday.  From start to finish, you will be entertained by the team, marching band, cheer squad, students and fans.  Don't leave early or you will miss jump around between the 3rd and 4th quarters and the 5th quarter at the end of the game.  Bone up on the lyrics to Sweet Caroline and learn to sing the Bud Song before you come for the total experience."
7335,Date of experience: November 2014,11-Jul-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Watched the Axe Bowl,"Buddy and me drove to Madison to watch the football game and see what the big deal was. We had a blast! Turns out that it was the biggest attendance in the history of the stadium, and it was a very close game. Would recommend wearing something extremely warm; there was ice under our feet the whole time."
7337,Date of experience: October 2014,9-Jul-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Everything a stadium should be,"Women could always use more ladies rooms (hint, hint), but this stadium offers lots of concession options, easy access, and besides that, it is beautiful. It's a gem for the UW, which takes great pride in it and the upkeep shows that pride. Staff is knowledgeable and helpful and it's as comfortable as any stadium (bring your little stadium pillow, in other words, if you're attending a game)."
7338,Date of experience: September 2014,7-Jul-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,LOUD,"We attend a Badger Football game each year. The stadium is old, and there are no backs on the seats and restrooms are nasty. However, the energy in the air, the band, the jump around, 5th quarter, are great. I do confess I need to go home and watch the game on tv, there are far too many things going on."
7339,Date of experience: September 2014,23-Jun-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,"Nice, well-kept stadium","Camp Randall becomes crowded fast, so I recommend arriving early and parking farther away to save on parking costs. The stadium is well-kept and hosts UW-Madison's games. There are many food options available, at stadium prices of course, but it is all part of the experience!"
7340,Date of experience: November 2014,22-Jun-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,"If you ever get a chance, go to a game!",Game time at Camp Randall stadium is an incredible experience. The atmosphere is like no other and the stadium itself is historic.
7341,Date of experience: November 2014,3-Jun-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Jump Around,All you need to know is you should visit on a football Saturday and get ready to jump around! Get ready to feel the stadium shake.
7345,Date of experience: October 2014,19-May-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Jump around,"Experiencing the ""jump around"" at the start of the 4th quarter is a ""bucket list"" experience!  Don't forget to stick around for the 5th quarter too - when the marching band plays a bunch of songs.  And the football has been pretty good the last several years!"
7347,Date of experience: October 2014,5-May-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,2,Classless Students,This is a family venue! The students have chants or songs that are very offensive and vulgar. It's too bad because the stadium is magnificent. I will stay home from now on and watch it on the tube.
7348,Date of experience: September 2014,1-May-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great venue for college football,"If someone wants to know what big time college football is all about, look no further than a fall Saturday spent at Camp Randall. From the neighborhood yard parties starting at sunrise and lasting till sunset to the sea of red on the streets and the stands to the boisterous singing in the student section and the top-notch band, this is a great experience. Although most games are likely sell-outs, it's possible to score tickets on the street at game time. Try your luck and enjoy the party."
7352,Date of experience: October 2014,20-Apr-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Best Big Ten Gameday Experience,Atmosphere for college football...the very best!  The fans are the friendliest in the Big Ten.  Jump Around and the Fifth Quarter are NOT to be missed!

7356,Date of experience: October 2014,14-Mar-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,"When you say Wisconsin, you say Camp Randall","Don't be coming to Madison in the fall without getting out your Red and White to support the Badgers at a home football game.  A truly uniquely Madison itinerary item.  Bike, walk, take a cab or park and tailgate.  Plenty of restaurants, bars and pop up food carts across from the stadium and Mickeys Dairy Bar."
7357,Date of experience: November 2014,10-Mar-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Best Vibe in BIG for football game if you like Badgers,"Downtown Madison, close to bars and restaurants and on UW Campus.  Tailgate is like no other with 100-thousand plus in local areas hours before games.  Wisconsin Band and students are loud and proud.  Stadium has been remodeled.  Doesn't sell alcohol.  Not many bad seats.  Only drawback is all bench seating and scrunch city."
7358,Date of experience: October 2014,28-Feb-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Best College Stadium in The Country,This is one of those stadiums that every college football fanatic needs to go watch a game. It by far has the best atmosphere out of any college football stadium I have ever been to.
7359,Date of experience: November 2014,19-Feb-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,See a Big 10 Game Here!  The Experience is Awesome!,"We have season tickets to Badger football games and you couldn't ask for a better fan experience.  From the actual game, to the superb WI marching band to vids and contests during the game to keep folks entertained -- there's nothing like a game AT Wisconsin.  It's great to see the opposing team Jump Around after 3rd quarter.  And it's even better to experience the stadium during a big WIN!  Just remember, when you're watching an NFL game on Sunday:   JJ Watt, Russell Wilson, James White, Chris Borland and many more PLAYED HERE!"
7360,Date of experience: September 2014,18-Feb-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Best Staduim,You have to experience what is like to see Camp Randall on football Saturday's. We've been to most of the stadiums in US & none are better than Madison's. You will leave feeling like a college student
7361,Date of experience: October 2014,11-Feb-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Great Stadium,Camp Randall is a lot more full these days than when I attended UW in the '80s.  It's a great venue to watch the game even if the infrastructure is pretty dated.  Don't forget to use the troughs in the bathroom.  And the UW Marching Band's fifth quarter is a must-see.
7362,Date of experience: November 2014,27-Jan-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,"Great Statium, Great Players","This is a must visit site when you're in Mad Town. You just have to go to a game. Put that on your wish list. Even if you're not a Badgers fan, you will be easily converted after the camaraderie  and spirit of Camp Randall."
7363,Date of experience: October 2014,24-Jan-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,There's a reason Madison is the BEST COLLEGE SPORTS TOWN,"I might be biased, being a season ticket holder, and UW Alum, but Camp Randall is a fantastic venue for a college football game. Be prepared to wear red, or stick out like a visitor. Few things to consider, there are not escalators, so if you are in the upper deck, allow yourself some time to get to your seats. Also, alcohol is not served inside??though there are plenty of locations to and from the stadium to enjoy a beverage. Also, the student section is in the south end zone, so if you are getting tickets there, you will stand the whole game??.though everyone JUMPS AROUND between the 3rd and 4th Quarter. Whether cheering for Bucky or his opponent, you will have a great time at Camp Randall."
7364,Date of experience: October 2014,3-Jan-15,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Great place for a  football game,"So much fun, except for the abysmal seats they sell to alumni of the visiting team. We no longer ever get alumni seats, but go through Stubhub.We were sat in the very far corner where the winds blow so hard, despite winter coats, hats, scarfs, blankets, boots, we had to leave and go watch the game at a sports bar.Sit anywhere else and you will have an amazing time, even if your team loses"
7365,Date of experience: October 2014,21-Dec-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Badger Football,"This is the best place of earth to go to a Badger Football game. Marching band is first class, fans are ""fan""tastic and have fun whether win or lose the game. They will dance to anything (especially House of Pain), and the tailgating before or after is a ton of fun! Wisconsin fans are definitely loyal to their teams (Go Packers!)"
7366,Date of experience: November 2014,2-Dec-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Must do when in the Capitol City,"We went to our first UW Wisconsin football game! It was awesome! We were on the 50 yard line and sitting quite cozy with our neighbor fans-let me tell you, it's a great way to stay warm. The team scored play after play and at half time we ate some unique Wisconsin Badgers food....Brat Nachos....delicious, Brat mac and cheese, good and fried cheese curds, can't go wrong. We also stayed for the 5th quarter when the band performs, after the game. They had so much since it snowed during and after the game, the band members were making snow angels in the snow."
7367,Date of experience: November 2014,2-Dec-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,A game experience like no other at NCAA level!!,Jump Around and have a blast with best fans in Big 10 and best game day atmosphere in the land.

7370,Date of experience: November 2014,16-Nov-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Is there a better place to watch college football?,I doubt it!  Go Badgers!  Great atmosphere.  Love jump around.  And of course the Badgers.  Even in the cold and snow.
7371,Date of experience: November 2014,15-Nov-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Fun time in the snow despite a loss,"Nebraska fans traveled to Camp Randall for the game.  Because it was supposed to snow we tried to park at Meriter Hospital for the covered parking which had event parking for $20 but it was full by the time we arrived.  We traveled a few more blocks down the street and parked at St. Mary's Hospital and it was only $5.  It was a little over one mile to walk to the stadium which took about 20 minutes.We had great seats, the fans were great, we enjoyed brats and hot chocolate at half time, and enjoyed the end of the 3rd quarter Jump Around.  There really are not tables to stand and eat in the interior so eating standing up was somewhat awkward.  Also they sold hot chocolate in the stands for $8.50 but you can buy for $3.50 in the interior stadium."
7372,Date of experience: September 2014,6-Nov-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Cannot miss!!!,"Great game happens hear. Enjoy the football game and Badger atmosphere, which you cannot see in any other place. cannot miss !!!!"
7373,Date of experience: October 2014,3-Nov-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,GO BADGERS!,Jump Around in between 3 and 4th quarters. Stay for the 5th quarter - wonderful UW Band performance.Just make sure you are clear as to which gate to enter thru or you may end up walking all around the interior till you get to your section.
7374,Date of experience: October 2014,31-Oct-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Homecoming Game 2014,"I had not been in Camp Randall Stadium for a football game in decades.  The UW game against Maryland this year was not only a stunning victory for the home team, but a great reminder to me of why I came to football games here as a youth and as a student at the UW back in the 60s.  I greatly enjoyed our tailgating group before and after the game."
7375,Date of experience: October 2014,31-Oct-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Missed not sitting in the student section.,The streets outside of the Stadium in the hour before game time are full of alumni and students (many drunk already) pushing and in the way of you finding your gate. It was my first time in the upper deck and the multitude of ramps seemed like climbing Mount Everest.
7376,Date of experience: October 2014,28-Oct-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Good Seats Near The Action,"Even sitting in the in-zone gives one the feeling that the playing field is close and intimate. Sound system is superior and crystal clear. Large TV screen lets you catch up with the action. Very limited restroom facilities near us, just a few porta-potties. Food selection is brats and hotdogs. No gourmet haven here.  No dome."
7377,Date of experience: October 2014,26-Oct-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Not a bad seat in the place and a ton of fun,I has been and I went for the badger Maryland game. It was our first time at the stadium. We had a wonderful seats on the 40 yard line in section are. Although I don't think that there would be a bad seat in the house. We were not too far from the student section which made it a lot of fun for us. Activities at the student said and the mascot Bucky was a blast. We lovedoing the wave and watching the kids jump around in the fourth quarter. Only downfall is that there was no beer. Of course the badgers one with a score of 52 to 7. Which meant Bucky did a lot of push-ups!
7378,Date of experience: November 2013,25-Oct-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,STATE High School Football #1 experience!,"WOW....I was impressed with my first visit to cheer on our high school football team.  ""Shock & Awe"" best sums up my first entrance to Camp Randall.  Photos could not even capture the true feeling of this place.  I would definitely return in the future."
7379,Date of experience: September 2014,22-Oct-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great college football experience,"Come early, park in someone's yard and wander around. Get a brat, see Bucky and the band.  Watch the student section.  So much energy, so much fun."
7380,Date of experience: October 2014,22-Oct-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great College Game Day Atmosphere,"One does not have to be a Wisconsin Badgers fan to appreciate the stadium and surrounding area.  The stadium itself is historic at nearly 100 years old however with renovations over the years is by all means modern.  Parking is limited so be prepared to either pay a premium or find a spot on the street and a walk a little.  Arrive early on game day and spend some time wandering through G.A.R. Park (located east of the stadium) which has a few monuments dedicated to the location being a former Union Army training camp during the Civil War.  Take a walk down Breese Terrace (street located on west side of stadium) and see what the college kids are up to pregame.  Entering the stadium is relatively straightforward as one can walk an entire loop around the entire stadium once inside.  Gate 5 is reserved for students but otherwise one can enter whichever gate is most convenient.  Besides the game itself, Jump Around after the third quarter, the unique versions of the wave, and the band's fifth quarter are not to be missed."
7381,Date of experience: October 2014,18-Oct-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Terrific College Football,Football was great.  The band was entertaining.  It's best to go early and wander around outside Camp Randall to all the stands selling food and beverages.  No beer inside the stadium.
7382,Date of experience: October 2014,14-Oct-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Jump around,"Jump, Jump, Jump around, Jump around. Jump, Jump, Jump around.  This is the best 'during the game' tradition in all of the NCAA.  If you wanna be a Badger, then come along with me..."
7383,Date of experience: October 2014,14-Oct-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,What a Stadium,No place better to watch a college football game. The stadium has energy beyond belief.  The end of the third quarter Jump Around is a classic event.
7384,Date of experience: September 2014,14-Oct-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,This is college football.,"Great game day experience, able to move around this stadium with ease. Plenty of access to food and restrooms. Very clean and well taken care of. Everyone was very nice to a visitor. Concessions were great! At and spent way too much; but I enjoyed myself."
7385,Date of experience: October 2014,13-Oct-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great college football stadium,"One of college football's best places to experience a game. Always a sell out, great fans who welcome visitors. Student section entertains with songs and chants. Jump around at beginning of third quarter is amazing experience."
7386,Date of experience: September 2014,12-Oct-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Very Nice,"The good: Great historically-rich setting, nice structure overall, good game day atmosphere in the neighborhood. Standard seating and views. Night game experiences can be really energizing and exciting. The size, quality, and setting make the venue itself a unique college football destination worth visiting. The bad: Some of the new additions are an eyesore, especially right next to the high-character Field House. And for day games, the fans are lame! For such a large, mostly inebriated crowd you would expect them to be louder and a lot more into the game. At times you actually feel like you are disturbing the people around you if you're trying to make noise. A lot of fans seem to be there to pass the time or sing songs played over the stereo system. I guess paying for the tickets passes for pouring your heart into it. (Apologies to the minority of fans who are proud and do get loud.) Tips: House tailgates are the best. Stick around after the game for the 5th quarter and bring a thick skin - even with a mostly tame crowd... there will be swears!"
7387,Date of experience: October 2014,11-Oct-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,When you say WIS CON SIN,you've said it all! Always a great time at a great stadium. Go Bucky!  Crowds are always Friendly and fun. The Fifth Quarter is worth staying for and the wave is my wife's favorite part of the day.  I have sat in the 13th row at the 45 and in the upper deck and both places are great spots to watch a game from.
7388,Date of experience: October 2014,6-Oct-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Rated Best in America,Should be on everyone's bucket list to experience one of college's best game day experiences. Great venues on Regent experience prior to the game for beer and brats.  Stay for the Fifth Quarter after the game and then head to the UW Memorial Union on the Lake.
7389,Date of experience: September 2014,4-Oct-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Badger Atmosphere!,"We make it down the Badger games a couple of times a year, and it is a fun, fun time.  They do a great job of entertainment (besides the football game!)  The band is fun to watch, plus they have tons of other things going on with the jumbo tron, special guests, etc.  It is definitely family-friendly, you may have to cover the little ones' ears when the students are shouting, but you will not get beer spilled on you.  Concessions are beyond pricey and into the outrageously-priced zone ($9 brats, $5 sodas,) but it's worth it just to be down there at the game."
7390,Date of experience: September 2014,4-Oct-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great gameday experience,What is not to love about the stadium? Unless you the opposing team maybe but even most of those fans appreciate the atmosphere. Definitely can be loud and a party atmosphere. The students could show up earlier than late first quarter. Jump Around is legendary of course. I miss the kids selling things in the stand. Instead it is adults which is not the same.
7391,Date of experience: September 2014,4-Oct-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Fun venue,Attended a football game and loved the traditions and the atmosphere.  Loved learning about the history of the camp as well.
7392,Date of experience: September 2014,1-Oct-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great Badger game,"It's a great experience to go to if you're a Badger fan....Especially to see the band.  Of course, pricey concessions but still a fun time."
7393,Date of experience: September 2014,29-Sep-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Home of the Badgers,"Nothing beats a day at Camp Randall.  I attend many Packer games a year but easily prefer Camp Randall.  The atmosphere is phenomenal, no bad seats, many dining options, friendly fans, etc.  Jump Around is legendary.  State Street is near by.   If you love college football you must experience a Saturday in Madison."
7394,Date of experience: September 2014,29-Sep-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,This stadium rocks,"Great views from almost every seat.  The atmosphere is electric and nothing beats ""jump around"" after the third quarter.  Madison really is a football town and to experience this stadium and the tailgating for blocks around is something to put on your must do list.  Don't like that you cannot carry in water or soda."
7395,Date of experience: September 2014,29-Sep-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Terrific Wisconsin Badger Experience!,"Attended our Annual Badger Football Weekend!This is a great facility and a Badger Football Game is a super event!  Especially when the Badgers pull out a victory!We have sat in different sections throughout the years and I am not sure if there is a bad seat in the house!Especially want to complement the staff attending the restroom facilities - for the large crowd that was in attendance!  They kept the line moving and things very clean.The scoreboard displays are fun!  The music is terrific.  The UW Wisconsin Marching Band is Awesome!My advice would be if you are attending with small children to review the sections and you might want to stay a couple sections away from the student section.  Sometimes there is foul language, but it is all in good fun."
7396,Date of experience: September 2014,7-Sep-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Go Bucky,Can't imagine a better venue to watch college football Have had season tickets for 25+ years and while the quality of the teams goes up and down Camp Randall never disappoints
7397,Date of experience: September 2014,3-Sep-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great venue for an American tradition on Saturdays in the fall,"If you love red, if you love spirit (aka top marching band, top student section), if you love top level college football, then you'll share the same love affair I have with Camp Randall Stadium. Go Bucky!"
7398,Date of experience: October 2013,6-Aug-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Fun fun fun,Two words........Jump Around!!  Great football in a beautiful stadium.  I went to the University of IL and they wish they had this happening on Saturday afternoons!
7402,Date of experience: October 2013,4-Jul-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Even better than a Packer game!,The energy inside Camp Randell is unparalleled. Jump around is a unique experience during the game. Neat place to see true football at its best.
7406,Date of experience: September 2013,2-Jun-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,No place like Camp Randall Stadium,Home of the Wisconsin Badgers and history abounds!!Great stadium with lots of police presence so you must behave yourself.  Walking distance to lots of shopping and dining and bars.

7409,Date of experience: September 2013,23-Apr-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Go Badgers,"What is not to like about Camp Randall Stadium?  Every football game is fun to watch and the 5th quarter makes it a fun way to end the game.  Lots of food choices and good entertainment at half-time, good music to cheer along with the crowd."
7412,Date of experience: November 2013,6-Jan-14,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,FUN,"What can one say about visiting Camp Randall and the excitement of the Wisconsin Badgers?  The surrounding area on game day is unreal.  The band is beyond awesome to watch.  The stadium is a neat, older place.  Always love a visit here.  Plenty of bathrooms, quite a gradual walk to your seats...depending how high up you may be."
7413,Date of experience: November 2013,29-Dec-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great place to watch football,"Camp Randall Stadium draws huge, energetic crowds even in the coldest weather.  Not to be missed if you're visiting Madison on a fall weekend."
7414,Date of experience: October 2013,14-Dec-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,A great college experience,"The atmosphere outside the stadium before the game was very fun. A ribeye sandwich at Otha's was a wonderful start to the afternoon. Once we got into the stadium, the energy was palpable! The game day was entertaining start to finish. Good football, rabid fans and the band was top notch. Two negatives - the student section's obscene chant (between 2 sections), and over priced concessions.  The Jump Around song was SO fun and the players did it too. A ""must do"" college football experience."
7415,Date of experience: November 2013,11-Dec-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Badger Birthday Bask,Sam at the group ticket sales office was amazing!  All of the staff at the stadium was very kind and helpful.  Awesome experience!  Can't wait to go back!
7416,Date of experience: December 2013,3-Dec-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,the best,"the best place to watch a college football game!  great sightlines, and plenty of seating space.  the food service is quite good, as well.  for those not tailgating,  there are plenty of bars/restaurants in the immediate area around the stadium catering to the crowd."
7417,Date of experience: November 2013,27-Nov-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Fun stadium,I attended the Wisconsin High School Football chamionship at Camp Randall Stadium.  It was a real fun experience. I took advantage of the shuttle bus from Allient Energy Center. That was a great service as I was nervous about driving on the campus with no idea where I was going.  Shuttle bus took us right to the ticket counter. Jumbo tron was fun to watch replays.
7418,Date of experience: November 2013,27-Nov-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,3,"Stadium is a MISH-MASCH, but food was great","I didn't love this stadium.  It is a mix of old-old and newer-old.  I'm not one to say rip it all down and start over -- but in truth, this stadium has seen its better days.  Seating is complex as are the passage-ways.  With all the money that Wiscy football brings in, you would think a major upgrade would be in the works.  I am hopeful that they can keep a little of the old-school charm, but they really need to start over.Weather was cold for November.  Windy as well.  The stadium did an OK job of shielding the fans, but I'm afraid the players weren't so lucky.  We had typical end-zone seats.  Visibility was not good from the end-zone.  There is really too much space between the end-zone seats and the field and then if the team is at the other end of the field -- well, it just isn't that great.  It is a big stadium, but I would recommend visitors find a way to get side seating at all costs.The food variety was TERRIBLE, but the food that was offered was solid.  The Brats were right on and I ate many :)  The place is clean and the fans were kind.  Loved my experience, but will know to upgrade seating next time around."
7419,Date of experience: November 2013,22-Nov-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Always a great time,"Camp Randall is awesome, no matter how many times I go there it never ceases to amaze me! To see a game here is the best. The weather was not very nice for the game, but it is WI in November so dress for it.There is so much tradition here if you are from Wisconsin it can bring a tear to your eye."
7420,Date of experience: November 2013,18-Nov-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Awesome game experience,"I come from Texas where football is life.  It's the air you breathe, and we take it seriously.  It was so nice to visit a place where football was a game, a thing to entertain and enjoy.  Unlike Texas, they use their PA system to play jams.  In Texas we use it to show commercials.  The entire stadium ""jump jump""'s b/w the third and fourth quarters and the students cracked me up, ""Let's go old people!""  When they wanted the rest of the stadium to do the wave they yelled that!  It was so fun!  Tied for best experience in Madison!"
7421,Date of experience: November 2013,17-Nov-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,On Wisconsin!,"Cheer on the Wisconsin Badgers in one of the nation's great college stadiums!  As a Badger myself I am hugely biased, but how can you not like this place?  Wisconsin Football is a special tradition, and this is such a fun place to be.  If you are bringing small children, stay away from seats near the student sections- sections P-K and some of L. (cheers can get a little.... R rated.)  Just pick seats a few sections away and you'll be fine.  Go Badgers!!!"
7422,Date of experience: November 2013,10-Nov-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Tradition and football what's not to love,We caught a badgers game in Madison. We would recommend a little research before you go on some of the traditions of the band as it's as much about them as the football. We did and took in the band preconcert at union south and stayed for the 5th quarter. We also followed them back to their buildings and listened to them as they got in. Maybe so much going on with the students and the band during the game that it does distract you from the football. I would say non football fans will also love it.
7423,Date of experience: October 2013,25-Oct-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,My first collegiate football game,"I had never attended a college football game before, despite the fact that I was an undergrad and a grad student for more years than I care to remember.  I hated the jocks in my high school, and vowed that i would never go to their games.  This attitude did not make me the most popular girl in high school.However, I was in Madison during Homecoming, and a friend had tickets, really good ones as it turned out.  So as much to honor him as anything else, I agreed to go.  Our seats were a few rows back from the endzone.  I don't have much to compare this experience to, because as I mentioned, it was my first college football game.  The crowds were well-behaved (nobody spiled beer on me or was drunk or obnoxious).  There was a lot of excitement, and of course, Wisconsin slaughtered their opponent so the crowd was in a good mood.  Everything was a lot of fun, and there were a lot of bathrooms so that the there was really no waiting to use the loo.  I bought a bottle of water for $4.50, which is a bit outrageous, but that is cheaper than what the charge in airports or in professional sports arenas, so I can't say that I am surprised.  When you have a captive audience who is dying of thrist, you can screw them, and everyone does.  Such is capitalism in the days of terrorism where you can't bring water into the stadium or the airport.  I could see doing this again."
7424,Date of experience: October 2013,14-Oct-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Nothing beats Camp Randall,A beautiful October afternoon and a Badger win at Camp Randall - nothing could be better.  Great stadium; great band; great team.  On Wisconsin!
7425,Date of experience: October 2013,12-Oct-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,2,not good at all,"Ok, I know the Badger fans will jump all over me thinking I am a bitter rival fan, but I actually cheer for Wisconsin. And I realize reviews of these games here will be all about the team, the fun student section, etc. But there is no way any unbiased person can say anything good about Camp Randall itself- the place is far below any other stadium I have been to, and I've seen many. My two complaints would be the setas and the concessions. If you are maybe 5'6"" or shorter, and maybe 125 lbs or less, then the setaing is fine for you. But for anyone 6'00"" or taller, or anywhere near or above average weight, you will be miserable in these seats. I sat at a 45 degree angle the entire game because with those seat backs you can't do anything else, unless the person in front of you will move forward just for you to have any room at all.I admit I did not walk the entire way around the stadium, but I walked at least a quarter of the way around and saw the worst selection of food choices anywhere. Nothing but basic concessions, and that was it."
7426,Date of experience: October 2013,12-Oct-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,On Wisconsin!,"Camp Randall is one of the greatest sports venues in college football. The history, atmosphere, and fans cannot be beat. The site of a Civil War training and prison facility has been turned to a football Mecca. Homecoming weekend is the quintessential college experience. Bucky makes it better. Go Big Red!"
7427,Date of experience: September 2013,10-Oct-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Go to a game,"You need to experience a Badger game. Go on a crisp fall day, kick through the leaves. Go early. Go to one of the local bars around the stadium. Get a brat and a beer. Wear red. Get into the atmosphere of the game. Jump around. Sing ""Varsity."" You'll be glad you did."
7428,Date of experience: September 2013,5-Oct-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Awesome experience to watch a football game,"Atmosphere. The setting is great, crowd reaction to the event is wonderful and historical.A must for Madison visitors."
7429,Date of experience: September 2013,26-Sep-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Fun crowd,"Went to visit the campus with my family and attended a Saturday afternoon game. Very lively crowd and a lot of fun. Good view of field even from upper deck. There is red everywhere. Stadium has nice scoreboards as well. I'm a bit jealous because I am from Illinois and an Illini fan. Tickets are not cheap nor easy to come by though. Game was a sellout and had to pay a little premium to get tickets on StubHub, so plan well in advance."
7430,Date of experience: September 2013,24-Sep-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,loved our Badger game day experience!,"If you ever have the chance, you MUST go to a Badger game!  It's the most special, charged, unique college game experience.  The various parties around campus / the stadium before the game are a blast!  The crowd is very friendly and happy. . . and love to party.  The stadium is outstanding!  And watching the student section just keeps you entertained the entire time.  Be sure to stay for Jump Around after the 3rd quarter and for the ""Fifth Quarter"" after the game when the band comes out on the field again to entertain.   You'll LOVE it!!!"
7431,Date of experience: October 2012,12-Sep-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,5th Quarter!,"Charming and nostalgic landmark.  Loved it in 1981 and still love it.  The best part....5th Quarter, which one must experience as part of their bucket list.  My children were in awe.  Although they are Spartan fans, they loved it!"
7432,Date of experience: September 2013,11-Sep-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Beautiful day for a victory,Love going back to campus for a football game.  Nice to see the stands full and enjoy the 5th quarter.
7433,Date of experience: September 2013,8-Sep-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Great day at Camp Randall,"Fun times full of team spirit, events and parties surround the stadium!  Union South has a great set up with big screen and full sevrice bar, hich includes a Bloody Mary bar with all the fixins!Beautiful view, we could see the Capital building from our row 34 top level seats! 48-0 WIN!"
7434,Date of experience: September 2013,8-Sep-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Wisconsin's College Football Landmark,"Camp Randall is a majestic landmark of college sports.  I am fortunate to live in the city that hosts this stadium.  Even better the Badgers have been one of college's best football teams in recent years.I went yesterday with my son.  We were able to score great tickets from StubHub for about $50 each because they were playing a college team that most people haven't heard of (Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles).  As expected, the Badgers rolled.  Enough about the Badgers, though -- this is all about Camp Randall.The stadium is massive.  It holds more than 80,000 people.  It is the 41st largest stadium in the world (according to WIKI) and holds just a few hundred less than Lambeau Field.  You walk in Camp Randall - it's awe-inspiring.Most of the seats are uncomfortable aluminum benches.  However, if you score good tickets, you can get padded seats with back support (which we were fortunate enough to have).  Before the game, you get to check out the offenses practicing sets and then the Badger Band get the crowd riled up (they're great and highly regarded, BTW).  The crowd is all decked out in cardinal and white (mostly cardinal) and really into the game.  Even without booze at the stadium (there's plenty of booze to be had outside the stadium), this is one of the most lively crowds you'll experience -- from waves, cheering, vocalizations and (of course) the ""Jump Around"" tradition in the 4th Quarter.  It's so much fun!  They do not need big giveaways or t-shirt guns to get us Sconnies amped.The concessions are a little bare-boned, but you can get water and soda between $4-$5 (not bad in today's market) and brats, hot dogs and subs for around that same price point. If you live in Wisconsin or are in Wisconsin during the football season, there is no other place to go for such and experience and not have to mortgage your home for.  If you live in Madison and don't visit, even if you do not care for football, you're totally missing out.Tip: For the real experience of Badgers football, pig out at Mickies Dairy Bar (across the street) pregame - disregard health and eat their pancakes, scrambler or corned beef hash to satisfy any food needs before observing/participating in Badgers football.  Note: Protective parents beware.  This is a college stadium.  The students section has traditions of loud cursing chants -- bring your ""earmuffs""."
7435,Date of experience: August 2013,6-Sep-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,First Football Game of the 2013 Season,"Had great seats, is section Q, right next to the student section.   We were in row 29 with a perfect view of the whole field.  The concessions are a bit overpriced, but that's what one gets in stadiums and arena's....."
7437,Date of experience: August 2013,31-Aug-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,There's a Reason,There is a very reason why Camp Randall is consistently rated as one of the very best college game day experiences.  It has it all. History. Great fans. Big 10 football and a experience to remember. Put  it on your bucket list if you want to experience college football at its finest. Stay for the Fifth Quarter. Worth the time.  After the game head to State St.  for a plethora of fine restaurants.
7438,Date of experience: August 2013,30-Aug-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Jump around,"Awesome time.  IF you go to a game you have to stay around for the 5th quarter!!  At the end of the 3rd quarter you can actually feel the stadium shake during ""Jump Around!!"""
7440,Date of experience: October 2012,29-Jul-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,One of the best Big 10 stadiums,"If you like Badger Football you'll get a great show at the stadium and stay  for the ""fifth quarter"" when the band really cuts loose. Beware students chants are not PG rated."
7441,Date of experience: October 2012,27-Jul-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,On Wisconsin - Go Badgers,"We have had UW Football tickets for over 35 years and have missed only 4 games (2 were when each of our kids were born, bad planning to have them during football season).The Camp is a great place to cheer on our beloved Badgers.  Almost all seats have a great line of sight, the UW Band in the North End Zone always keeps things hopping.  Poms, Cheerleaders and Tubas circle the field during the game keeping fans engaged.Go for UW Homecoming and see the law school students toss their canes over the South goalpost (if you catch it you will win your first case).  The UW Band under Mike Leckrone never fails to put on an awesome pre-game and half-time show but there's more - the 5th Quarter.  The postgame concert is legendary and you gotta stay for that.  Miss the old days when they used to then go to the ""old"" UW Children's Hospital for a short concert but het things change and the hospital moved farther from the field.Plenty of restrooms, typical stadium food but not overpriced like some places we have been to.So Go Badgers and On Wisconsin looking forward to another awesome season under our new coach, good-luck Coach Anderson"
7444,Date of experience: August 2012,29-Jun-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Go Badgers!!,"As a die hard Wisconsin Badger fan, and a graduate of this excellent school, Camp Randall is mecca.  The history and spirit of this iconic college sports venue is not to be missed!GO BADGERS!!  ON WISCONSIN!"
7446,Date of experience: November 2012,10-Jun-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Best stadium out there!!!!,This is a fantastic experience everyone should put on their bucket list! Make sure to stick around for the famous Jump Around experience at the end of the 3rd quarter.
7447,Date of experience: September 2012,30-May-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Awesome,"Camp Randall is amazing! Madison was named the best college football town in America and Camp Randall is the heart of it. Just like all sports places food is a bit pricey,but there is really no way around it. This year they are adding a new score board so it should be even better!"
7448,Date of experience: October 2012,22-May-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Go Badgers!,"As a long time season ticket holder, I can attest that there is no better place to watch college football.  The fan are great, the ease of getting in the satdium superb, and the atmosphere electric.  There is always a line to fill my other ticket.  The only negative is that the parking can be difficult.  Special note:  They have banned smoking on stadium propeerty this year.  This should make game day even more enjoyable."
7451,Date of experience: October 2012,14-Mar-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,Game day!!!,You must go to a Wisconsin football game if you're in town for it! It's a great atmosphere and you can experience real Camp Randall and Wisconsin traditions (such as Jump Around!). The student section is especially spirited ;) It's a must if you want to watch some good big 10 football. You might have to park quite far and walk to Camp Randall if you don't come early enough. Go Badgers!
7452,Date of experience: October 2012,21-Jan-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,5,A true big ten tradition,If your a football fan you have to visit Camp Randall while in Madison. It ranks with the horseshoe and the big house in tradition.

Oh, then there's football, which has also been quite good in recent years. Wisconsin has amazing football and tailgating traditions, it's worth a visit."
7455,Date of experience: September 2012,2-Jan-13,Big Ten,Wiscosin,4,Football Game - Season Opener,"Fun, energetic both inside and outside the stadium.  Easy to get in and out of stadium and parking was close by."

Our seats were in the upper section but still a good view of the play on the field.  Great view of the city from the upper  balcony walkway.  People were nice, stadium was clean.  Tickets were pricey, even for these seats.  It was very helpful to have the escalator to reach the upper level. Found neighborhood parking easily enough and there was a good traffic management plan for exodus, albeit slow."
7462,Date of experience: September 2020,14-Sep-20,Pac-12,Oregon state,4,Nice,Nice looking stadium.  We could not get in (not game day) but walked and drove around the perimeter.  Can't wait to see a game here!
7463,Date of experience: November 2018,26-Nov-18,Pac-12,Oregon state,4,Cool Stadium,Came to town for the Civil War Game between the Ducks and Beavers. We are Ducks fans from Northern California. First time to this stadium after going to Autzen a few years back. The stadium is nice but parking close to the stadium is a bit of an issue. Entry into the stadium took forever because of the bag check. Inside the gates the beer and food prices are pretty standard for most sporting events. Game was great.  Ducks won 55-15 !!!
7464,Date of experience: November 2018,4-Nov-18,Pac-12,Oregon state,5,Football game,"What a great experience at the football game, prices are the same at most stadiums, stadium clean, well taken care of, fan base very friendly, even though they lost, they still held their heads high, they true,yo love their football games. We had a great experience and would recommend you to stop in and see a game. Parking is hard to find, but the churches offer parking with a good walk to the stadium."
7465,Date of experience: October 2018,1-Oct-18,Pac-12,Oregon state,4,A typical football stadium experience,"Food is over priced by far. You can't take in any outside food. You need a clear bag to take anything into the stadium and no purses. You need to park 4 hours before the game in order to get a desirable spot (we need a handicapped one.)Personal gripe mandatory rap music before the game. You get to see all that is cut out on TV and replaced with talking heads bloviating.After game traffic is pretty bad, but they do pretty well with managing it. Make no time commitment after the game. You will sit in traffic for some period of time. Highway 34 to I-5 is crowded afterward, but moves very rapidly until you get to I-5, where it slows drastically. We head south afterward and find no traffic issue. North is probably a different matter. If the Beavers just one more than a single game so far.....sighNOTE: Parking and program vendors do NOT accept credit cards. Be sure to have cash to pay for parking. Parking attendants very helpful."
7466,Date of experience: October 2017,22-Mar-18,Pac-12,Oregon state,5,Fun!,"I love the energy at this stadium. Beaver fans are a lot of fun, and the events are always fun to watch here. It??s a little cramped, but it helps keep you warm."

7471,Date of experience: October 2016,30-Jan-17,Pac-12,Oregon state,5,Great spot... usual amenities!,"We have season football tickets at Reser Staduim and like the variety it offers.  You can buy cheaper tickets in the end zone seated on bleachers without backs, all the way up to suite level tickets, inside, with food and alcohol served in the area - and everything in between.  The stadium isn't as big a some so you can still be up closer to the field and players, depending on where you buy tickets.  Many entrances keep lines short going in and they make it easy to come and go if you get your hand stamped.  Reser is a great place to attend games because there is a price point for tickets at all levels."
7472,Date of experience: September 2022,7-Dec-22,Pac-12,Washington state,5,Martin Stadium:  Small But Mighty,"I think the mistake almost all make when considering what to say about WSU's Martin Stadium is this:  ""...it is small.  The smallest stadium in The Pac-12 conference.""  That simply does not convey any real information about the experience of watching a football game at WSU's Martin Stadium.  I have been there.  It is a fantastic experience.  Why?  This gem of a horseshoe stadium is wedged, almost shoe-horn style smack dab in the very center of the Washington State University campus.  It is flanked on all sides by campus buildings:  classrooms, laboratories, art galleries, the Student Union building, and the WSU football complex.  All this up-close brick and concrete reflects the sounds made by Martin Stadium's 33,000 inhabitants directly down on to the playing field.  The decibal meter pegs when the fans of WSU start screaming because of all that incredibly intimate seating structure placing the fans almost on top of the players.  I cannot recall too many other stadiums where the fans are so close to the playing field.  At Martin Stadium the fans are only a few feet from the sidelines.  So when this place is full it is loud in spite of the fact sellout only really means there are 33,000 in attendance...but because of the layout of Martin Stadium, those 33,000 sounds like 133,000!  I am not kidding you.  This is one of the coziest little, toughest little places for any visiting team to play.  If you have an opportunity to visit The Palouse of Eastern Washington make it a point to tour WSU's scenic hilltop campus and take in a Cougar football game at Martin Stadium.  You will love it.  This is classic College Football the likes of which we rarely see these days.  Martin Stadium, for me, is one of the best Pac-12 stadiums."

Great place.  #GOCOUGS"
7477,Date of experience: September 2019,2-Sep-19,Pac-12,Washington state,5,Fight Fight Fight for Washington State,"Upon entry into this state of the art stadium, one is greeted with the giant boom box next to the scoreboard. The music is current and makes one want to bounce/walk with the best.The spectators are decked out in crimson and grey WSU swag as they make their way to their seats.Depending upon where one is seated, there may be seat cushions and backs provided. The drawback is that the cushions prevent the seats from being raised to allow people to pass. One just stands and people can squeeze by.Lots of food options and non-alcoholic drinks are offered for sale upon entry. As one enters, whatever you are carrying must be in a see-through bag to prevent anyone carrying alcohol or a weapon to enter.To enjoy a fantastic PAC 12 football experience, buy a ticket and enjoy."

Not ideal for young families unless you want them exposed to this, or maybe they already are. no lodging in the area, had to drive to Lewiston to stay after the game. Remember over 1000.00 was spent on this event with tickets lodging and food for three adults, can the area afford to loose this business"

What a huge improvement.  Really a first rate structure.  While still small by PAC-12 standards, the Cougars can be proud of their home field.  And, when filled with the Cougar faithful, the home field advantage will be highly measurable.  GO COUGS!"
7495,Date of experience: November 2016,21-Mar-17,Pac-12,Washington state,5,Great place to watch Cougar Football!,"The remodel of the Cougar stadium has been a great addition to the campus and football program.  Unlike other PAC 12 stadiums, you have a closer look at the field and it is located in an excellent location, close to everything on campus."
7496,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Nov-16,Pac-12,Washington state,5,High Energy Stadium in the Coolest College Town Around,"It's been a while since I was a student but I take my kids to Pullman on a regular basis, and one of the stops is always Martin Stadium. WSU has spent a lot of money on upgrades over the last several years, but the intimate, high energy feel is still there. Take the kids to a football game if you get the chance, they will absolutely love it. The scenery in the Palouse Hills is second to none. You won't find an athletic venue like this anywhere else. Go Cougs!"
7497,Date of experience: October 2016,18-Oct-16,Pac-12,Washington state,3,Vastly improved. Still a lot of work to do.,"Since the time I was a student, Martin Stadium is much improved in so many different ways. There are some deficiencies, as well. I'll hit pros and cons.Pros:The pressbox is really nice now, as opposed to the old one, which looked like a red single-wide trailer. There are, what appear to be nice luxury boxes, though I wouldn't know. I haven't, and probably never will, have the chance to go in one :(.The scoreboard is nice and big.The digital signage in the stadium is great, especially during the night games, which, due to the Pac-12 networks, is a more common occurrence.The football ops building encloses the stadium, making it feel a little smaller. When other teams are in a bandbox, and the proximity of the fans to the field is close, in many ways, there is actually a MORE intimidating feeling for the opposition than if they were in a 60,000-seat stadium where fans sit on the outside of some track.From a fan's perspective, the field turf means the field is always in perfect condition. That's nice.The pressbox, new scoreboard, new digital runners, and football ops building all add NEW to the experience. New = additional legitimacy.Cheering acoustics are good.In-game entertainment is fairly entertaining. Cons:The seating bowl is completely antiquated. Most of the seats are metal. Metal, in cold-weather stadiums? Sounds like a terrible idea.The concourses are not nearly wide enough.Everything about the concourse vendors reeks of having been retrofitted to be able to squeeze something else in.The audio mix is often terrible during the game. The PA is often too soft and isn't heard well over some of the music. Might help to have people actually in the seating bowl during testing rather than just doing an ear-check from the pressbox.Staff Pro, which does the gate entry, doesn't know what's going on from week to week, in terms of what is allowed and what isn't. There are some people that let anything in the gate. You could seriously bring in a weapon (I'm not advocating that). However, other people stop you and, in all cases, start arguing that you can't bring in certain things that ARE allowed. Yes, I have both the Gameday rules printed and with me, along with Washington state WAC (rules) that govern Martin Stadium. I bring these with me for these situations. Yet, these brain surgeons still argue, so you have to get their supervisor. Then, it's still a 50/50 split on whether they'll let you through, or will stand there scratching their head like a monkey in the zoo. Then you get to have an argument with THEM. THIS SHOULDN'T BE THE CASE!!!The ticket scanners are old. They're using some kind of bygone technology that falters all the time and then a line builds up.Interns stand around. In most athletic venues, where there is a profit-motive, the employees and interns walk through the stadium on rainy days and wipe down seats. Not here. And, when it snowed, they didn't do ANYTHING to clear the stands, AT ALL. So then we got compact snow and people were falling. Nobody cared. The hubris of the athletic department, unfortunately, trickles down to the stadium.In conclusion, I love going to Coug games. And I realize it costs money to have top-of-the-line. However, when Bill Moos talks about his athletes and their diet, he often talks about not putting cheap gas in a luxury car. I agree. Yet, some of the things the athletic department could do (like wiping down seats) wouldn't have a hard cost affixed. So why are we treating these valuable fans (luxury cars) like crap (cheap gas)?"
7498,Date of experience: October 2016,4-Oct-16,Pac-12,Washington state,5,Great stadium!,"We were up this weekend and were really impressed by the stadium - it felt intimate, with great views of the field and a gorgeous walk up to the top of the hill/campus to find it. Nice amenities with good food options and plentiful restrooms. Next door is the campus book store and a nice dining court if you are early. This was one of the last Pac 12 stadiums we hadn't been to yet and it was a fantastic experience!"
7499,Date of experience: October 2016,2-Oct-16,Pac-12,Washington state,5,Such nice people,We went to our first Cougars game and were impressed with how nice everyone was. They truly tried to get you an answer to your question no matter what it was. The game was great and the experience was too.Go Cougs!
7500,Date of experience: September 2016,15-Sep-16,Pac-12,Washington state,5,Home of the Cougs,"Martin Stadium is a great place to watch the Cougs play at home. It offers plenty of open seating, so a large amount of people can attend. It also has the museum of champions next to it, so a person can see the football legends that have played in the stadium, and have called Pullman home."
7501,Date of experience: September 2016,11-Sep-16,Pac-12,Washington state,5,Has really improved in recent years,The facilities have become world class. The new press box and football operations building are impressive. The stadium has not lost it's intimate feel and there is not a bad seat in the house. It can be one of the best atmospheres in college football when the student section is packed and the Cougs are good. I did think the constant blaring music detracted from the college football environment because it at times overpowered the marching band.
7502,Date of experience: August 2016,28-Aug-16,Pac-12,Washington state,5,Great Football Stadium,"As a Cougar dad of twins going to WSU I must really say I enjoy coming to Martin Stadium for football. My first year here was 2014 and never saw the Cougs win. Last year 2015 came for two games and saw them beat Arizona and WSU went on to win a bowl game. Whenever I come to WSU football i can't help but be inspired by the crowd, stadium and all those students acting silly (but proud of their school). GO COUGS!"
7507,Date of experience: November 2015,28-Nov-15,Pac-12,Washington state,2,Let down,"Went to the CU/WSU game. It was the last home game of the season, but not sold out or really even that close. It was the first time WSU had been ranked in nearly a decade and it was a pretty quiet game. Fans started leaving early as well. It was cold out, sure, but that's also the fun of fall football. I didn't expect it to be Michigan or Bama, but to be completely honest I had a lot more fun at the Idaho vs Wofford game. That is not a compliment. I was literally trying to give my tickets away to people in WSU gear before the game and no one would take them. Not a good sign for your program when your own fans won't take free tickets. Still fun watching the Buffs lose, though."
7508,Date of experience: November 2015,12-Nov-15,Pac-12,Washington state,4,Very fun atmosphere,"Went to the ASU / WSU game, it was a blast even though my team lost lol. As said in other reviews it can get cold so dress warm."
7509,Date of experience: November 2014,26-Oct-15,Pac-12,Washington state,5,best place for a football game,"go cougs go !! awesome location, lots of fun . be ready it can get very cold here . WSU rocks for sure"
7510,Date of experience: October 2015,6-Oct-15,Pac-12,Washington state,5,Love the changes...Go Cougs!,It is wonderful to see what has been done with this beautiful stadium. I remember growing up in Pullman that it was a highlight of my day to walk up to campus and run the stairs. The stadium wasn't so glitzy then. No private booths a lot less seating and no national televised coverage. Just a simple structure for the college and high school games. We also didn't have a gorgeous bronze cougar at the entrance. We had a cougar in a cage that they brought out during the football games. I like the fact that they don't do that anymore. Everything changes and it's nice to see these changes for the better for everyone to enjoy!
7511,Date of experience: September 2015,27-Sep-15,Pac-12,Washington state,5,World class stadium,"My wife and I were given tickets by relatives to attend the Wazzu vs. Wyoming game on September 19th. They have a partnership with WSU, and as a result we were treated to Coaches Club seating for our 5th wedding anniversary. We could never afford access to this area on our own, and I was grateful for this once in a lifetime experience. Coaches Club offers small apps (cheese, wings) and sandwiches (bbq pulled pork, hot dogs) during the game. A bar within the club offers plenty of selections, most at $5. If you have access to this small area on the 4th floor, you're in for a special viewing opportunity. Living and working in Madison, WI the Badgers' Camp Randall looms over the city on fall football Saturdays. We didn't feel like Martin Stadium towers over Pullman, and the city was remarkably easy to navigate on game day. Martin Stadium itself is beautifully updated, and we could not get over the beauty of the surrounding hillsides. I have accessed Camp Randall on game days and for work, and I honestly would pick Martin Stadium for a game every time. Every seat appears to have a great vantage point over the field, and you feel like a member of the sideline not 1 in 70,000+. The Bookie (Wazzu gear and more) is nearby, and parking is very efficient in the area. I am looking forward to a return in the future, but until then...Go Cougs!"
7512,Date of experience: August 2015,18-Aug-15,Pac-12,Washington state,5,Field access,"How awesome it was to be able to walk on the field. That might sounds crazy but it's true. Most places don't allow you access to the field, let alone let you walk on the field."
7513,Date of experience: November 2014,22-Dec-14,Pac-12,Washington state,4,Home of the Cougs!,"Martin Stadium is the center point of the Washington State University campus and home to the best crowd in the PAC-12. The field was recently renovated to include new seating, box seats, and a state of the art football operations building. The seats are standard fare for a large stadium - bring a cushion or blanket to sit on. Parking is problematic even in the off season, so plan ahead. Security is very good and they do not allow alcohol in the stadium. Be sure to stop in the Fieldhouse to meet Butch and enjoy the food."
7514,Date of experience: November 2014,1-Dec-14,Pac-12,Washington state,5,Go Cougs!,"As a Coug we had to see the fully renovated stadium and it did not disappoint.  It's like rags to riches, starting with the new field, club seats, press box, and operations building.  If that wasn't enough there's the state-of-the-art video board anchored in the east end adjacent to Stadium Way. But wait there's more.  All of this tied together with a new audio system and premium seating makes Martin Stadium the one to beat. But if that still doesn't take your breath away then the Coug Fever surely will. We, Cougars alike, can finally match our die hard enthusiasm with a top notch stadium.  Go Cougs!"
7515,Date of experience: September 2014,17-Oct-14,Pac-12,Washington state,5,Tremendous!!!,Martin Stadium was a fantastic place to watch football before all of the renovations.  Now....WOW!  The place is incredible!!   The scoreboards throughout add so much to the game.  Jumbotron is incredible!
7516,Date of experience: September 2014,24-Sep-14,Pac-12,Washington state,4,GREAT GAME/ATMOSPHERE,Went to the cougs/ducks game. First time here. Loved it. Stadium has been upgraded with new features and was nice. Packed house. Loved the coug walk by the players prior to game. Seats were really good (section 22 row B) near the end zone but with jumbotron scoreboard when action was at other end you could still watch the game on it. Only downside was the lack of traffic control leaving the game by both campus and Pullman PD. Stayed in Colfax and drive took well over an hour after the game. Prior to that was 23 minutes. Will stay in Moscow next time. Better road for night travel.
7517,Date of experience: October 2013,5-Jan-14,Pac-12,Washington state,5,Newly Renovated,Go Cougs! The stadium is still undergoing tremendous renovations that makes this stadium a premier stadium in college football. It does get cold though for games after October timeframe and if they are afternoon games there are certain spots where you are not going to get sunshine so it becomes more cold.
7518,Date of experience: August 2013,8-Oct-13,Pac-12,Washington state,5,Love the renovation!,New score board and set up is worth the wait! About time Pullman entered the big leagues with Martin Stadium.
7519,Date of experience: December 2011,25-Oct-12,Pac-12,Washington state,3,Co Cougs.,"WSU could have spent a little more time and money working on some other projects, rather than spending the majority of their budget on the giant screens over the floors. The stadium is pretty small, so there really isn't a bad seat, but be sure to get there super early for a decent place to park."
7521,Date of experience: October 2011,20-Jul-12,Pac-12,Washington state,5,Go Cougs!,"A game day in Pullman is always a fun family event.  The whole town becomes one big tailgate party!  Stop by Ferdinand's for ice cream, walk the campus to watch the festivities, and enjoy a great day of Cougar football!"
7523,Date of experience: November 2022,20-Jul-23,SEC,Louisiana,5,Welcome to Death Valley,"This is the place to watch a college football game. I can understand why this stadium is ranked one of the best. We were lucky to attend a game when 'Bama was in town. From tailgating to all the pre-game festivities to the big game, this place rocked! I have never seen so many loyal fans in one place. The campus was buzzing with excitement! Even though our seats were very high up we were still able to see everything. We had a birds-eye view for the outstanding half-time show with the band. If there was a roof on this stadium it would have been blown off when the Tigers ?? won in OT.  For any college football fan visiting this stadium is a must during a rival SEC game."
7524,Date of experience: November 2022,19-Mar-23,SEC,Louisiana,5,Bucket List Trip!,"This ought to be on everyone??s ??to do list??. Until you??ve had the experience to experience an LSU home game, you haven??t watched football. The band is amazing and the fans are the most loyal I have seen."
7528,Date of experience: October 2021,3-Oct-21,SEC,Louisiana,5,Great LSU game!,Great place to watch a game.  Be aware of the drunk college students but the overall experience was great.  SEC football is fun to watch!
7531,Date of experience: October 2020,22-Oct-20,SEC,Louisiana,5,Chance of rain? Never,"Okay, just because you hate LSU football, does not mean Tiger Stadium is terrible. This is like me saying Bryant-Denny sucks, just because I hate Alabama football. It is nice and so is Tiger Stadium. The biggest thing about Tiger Stadium is you have to be in it, during a game, preferably an SEC game, to understand. It becomes it own living organism. The restrooms are not great, this is true and we have whined for ages. The concessions have gotten much better, especiaily in the last couple years when they added craft beer and some better foods. If you want to get in relatively cheap, there is an area called skyline club, yes it is a nose bleed, but food is included, which is great with kids. We had season tickets in the upper deck, front row, at about the 20 yard line. What is great about the first 12 or so rows in Tiger Stadium upper deck, is that they have actual chair seating, not a metal bench, but actual chairs."
7532,Date of experience: September 2020,4-Oct-20,SEC,Louisiana,5,Great Atmosphere!!!,A trip to Baton Rouge is not a trip without a visit to LSU Stadium.  It is worth your time and money to visit an LSU Football game!
7533,Date of experience: October 2019,8-Aug-20,SEC,Louisiana,5,We won!,"For years I never saw the Dawgs win in La.  The crowd was kind and genteel.  A group next to own tailgate taught us the Freeze!  I didn't mention that Ronnie Milsap was from Georgia and went to Young Harris.  But, I like their music and I liked their style.  Stadium was clean.  Concessions were very fast and good.  I'm still a Dawg but I love Baton Rouge!"
7534,Date of experience: November 2019,2-Jul-20,SEC,Louisiana,5,The Boom Boom Room,Lord knows himself ant enough words in the dictionary to describe how great Tiger Stadium It fell like the whole stadium be moving it??s real loud an fun they always give you a great show best football stadium ever
7535,Date of experience: November 2019,13-Apr-20,SEC,Louisiana,5,Battle of the Boot,For my Birthday my daughters gave me a trip to see the Tigers play against Arkansas. This was the Tigers perfect season and I was proud to have been there to see one game! Tiger Stadium is a magnificent place for all to see!!!
7536,Date of experience: November 2019,6-Mar-20,SEC,Louisiana,5,Nothing Like Tiger Stadium,"There is no place like Tiger Stadium on a game night.  Atmosphere is electric.  Often you can't hear yourself cheering because the noise level is so high.  It is definitely a must do, bucket list type event for football fans.  Actually everyone with a heartbeat would enjoy the experience1"
7537,Date of experience: December 2019,12-Jan-20,SEC,Louisiana,5,Fun walk with the kids,We took the kids to see Mike the Tiger who was out and about. Loved seeing all the plaques with past and present tiger info. The stores was open to purchase gear.
7538,Date of experience: October 2019,10-Jan-20,SEC,Louisiana,5,Best atmosphere in the world,"LSU is the best. Their stadium is the best in the country, but the fans are better. If you are on the fence about coming to a game. Get off of it and go to it. IT  IS. THE. BEST. ATMOSPHERE"
7539,Date of experience: October 2019,20-Dec-19,SEC,Louisiana,4,Old but nice,What a wonderful atmosphere!!! Vibrant and great place to watch a football game. It is an experience that must be in your bucket list to visit at least once.
7540,Date of experience: November 2019,17-Dec-19,SEC,Louisiana,4,We had a blast watching the Heisman trophy winner and future national champions play,"We're not used to being able to buy alcohol at a college football game, so that was a pleasant surprise at Tiger stadium. BTW, we didn't see any more drunk students here than in our alcohol free Big Ten stadium. Hello Big Ten.....are you listening? We sneak it in anyway, so you might as well make some money off of it on game days.I wouldn't exactly call the stadium modern. Our home stadium has a huge scoreboard, way bigger than the tiny video board at Tiger stadium. Also, the corridors are so narrow that the line for the men's bathroom severely restricted the general flow of traffic and access to nearby food vendors.But the bottom line is that we got to see the best quarterback and best team in the country play on a Saturday night, while our team is essentially going to a toilet bowl.The LSU fans aren't arrogant like the Alabama fans, so we had a lot of fun commingling with complete strangers.Geaux Tigers from the mitten state!"
7541,Date of experience: November 2019,16-Dec-19,SEC,Louisiana,5,Catch a Big Game at Night,"If you want a college game day(and night) experience that will provide a ""Remember the time we..."" experience, catch a big night game in Tiger Stadium.  There is no pre-game tailgating that compares to LSU...the food (from gumbo to jambalaya to etouffee to grilled oysters to...) is delicious...and most tailgaters are happy to share their dishes.  The music varies from party to party, just keep moving till you find your tunes...sattelite dishes/streaming provides tailgaters with the day's games...you will likely end the day with many new friends....Oh, the stadium...originally designed to look similar to the Roman Colosseum, additions obscure much of the architectural detail; however, the north end of the exterior still maintains the classic look of an acient amphitheatre.  Inside, with 102,320 other spectators, is where the magic of Tiger Stadium will transform your viewing of a college football game into a singular experience...Saturday Night in Death Valley"
7542,Date of experience: November 2019,14-Dec-19,SEC,Louisiana,4,A great modernized stadium with terrible parking facilities.,The stadium is fine - the seats are spacious enough - ramps and stairs are workable certainly. The jumbotron screens and scoreboards are clearly visible. The restrooms & concessions are adequate - some of the fans are way over-served - and who in their right mind would Boo the opposing team's band - especially the Texas Aggie Band?! The biggest deficit is the lack of parking with shuttle service to the stadium. The PA System is very hard to hear as the announcers' voices are muffled.  My first time here.
7544,Date of experience: November 2019,2-Dec-19,SEC,Louisiana,5,Night Game,"I am an alumni, but a night game should be on any sport fans bucket list.  The tailgating experience alone is worth the trip."
7545,Date of experience: November 2019,24-Nov-19,SEC,Louisiana,5,1st time to Tiger Stadium,Wonderful first time Baton Rouge trip! Great atmosphere at the stadium and all the tailgating.

7547,Date of experience: October 2019,6-Nov-19,SEC,Louisiana,5,BEST PLACE TO BE ON SATURDAY NIGHT IN DEATH VALLEY,My children went to LSU and my son was in the LSU Fighting Tiger Band on the Drum Line  many years ago.  You get chills when the band enters the field and gives the LSU Salute to the crowds.  You have to take in a LSU game (if you can get tickets) and you will experience the feeling that everyone feels when watching LSU take on one of their rivals. You won't be sorry you spent the money because it will be something you will always remember.
7548,Date of experience: October 2019,5-Nov-19,SEC,Louisiana,5,Southern Football,Great place to experience southern college football. Service is awesome and the energy is electric! ????

There is simply nothing like a Saturday night in Tiger Stadium.  If you've never been there, you must go at least once.  Try to make a night game and if possible an SEC game."
7552,Date of experience: October 2019,26-Oct-19,SEC,Louisiana,5,Great old stadium.  Well organized event,I went here for the LSU vs Auburn game. The place was of course packed.

7553,Date of experience: October 2019,22-Oct-19,SEC,Louisiana,5,Death Valley,I loved driving by the awesome stadium that I have seen numerous times on Sports Channels. The stadium is HUGE!!! The seats in the upper tiers look so scary- almost defying gravity!!!  The stadium looks so stately as you drive across the Interstate bridge into Baton Rouge. I intend to return soon for a LSU Tigers football game.
7554,Date of experience: October 2019,16-Oct-19,SEC,Louisiana,5,Should be on everyone??s bucket list,Tiger stadium lives up to everything you??re ever heard/ read. It??s completely overwhelming butA trip to remember. Surprised (pleasantly ) by the lay out - washrooms everywhere and they were clean!  Staff were super friendly and able to help or point you in the right  direction. Not hard toFind your way around. Lots of signage and concession stands everywhere. No need to walk long distances to get to anything- unless ofCourse you want to walk around and take it all in. Everyone should go to an LSU game at least once

Home of the Earthquake Game and Cannon Blast on a Halloween night, this pantheon of concrete and steel is filled by over one hundred thousand fans, surrounded by hundreds of thousands more as we celebrate Tiger Football on a Louisiana Saturday Night. If you don??t understand what I just said - it??s a football stadium in Baton Rouge, Louisiana - home of the LSU Fighting Tigers. It??s packed full of screaming fans whose excitement has literally set off seismographs nearby. Even if you don??t like football, you should make it a point to tailgate all day then go to a Saturday night game at Tiger Stadium. ??????????"

However, LSU has fans that think it is ok to throw whiskey bottles at opposing fans, etc.  I am all about good hearted ribbing among fans but sometimes it gets out of control here.  I can handle it but my wife refuses to go back.  There is a reason it is called Death Valley.  There are a lot of good reasons to visit so don't let my negative comments deter you...Just be prepared, lol"

7573,Date of experience: November 2018,27-Apr-19,SEC,Louisiana,5,LSU Football Game Day,"It??s HOT nearly every game you attend... but there are a few near the end of the season where you will need jackets, hats, and gloves... especially if you are sitting in an upper deck."
7574,Date of experience: November 2018,21-Apr-19,SEC,Louisiana,5,Death Valley - LSU Stadium,"If you love football you'll love LSU Tiger Stadium.  It seats over 100,000 football fans with about 25,000 outside the stadium partying..Tail gating is a big thing at LSU and usually begins the night before a big game.  Tickets are at a premium but there are always fans selling tickets outside the stadium.  Bring your enthusiasm and a set of ear plugs because it can become deafening at times.  The biggest attraction is the entrance of the LSU Band prior to the game.  The entrance on the field is the same every week but the fans go crazy when the 135 piece band comes strutting their stuff.  See you at the game."
7577,Date of experience: October 2018,13-Apr-19,SEC,Louisiana,5,First Time Here,"I went to my first LSU football game against Ole Miss. If anyone remembers that, it was pouring rain for the majority of the game.  What amazed me about it, the fans never left until LSU was up by 28 in the fourth quarter.  The atmosphere is second to none at night. This is a must do item if you are a college football fan."
7578,Date of experience: October 2018,1-Apr-19,SEC,Louisiana,5,Awesome Experience,"Without a doubt, this arena is the most exciting place I have ever been. The noise, spirit, and excitement is beyond compare. Now matter where you are in the country, this place is the place to be on Saturday night."
7579,Date of experience: October 2018,20-Mar-19,SEC,Louisiana,5,BEST COLLEGE FOOTBALL VENUE,"It's Electric, It's Loud, It's GREAT. Without a doubt, Tiger Stadium is one the the worlds best places to see and be a part of one of America's best College Football Stadiums. Some of America's Greatest college teams have played here. The crowd roars the entire game. Very friendly to visitors but always wishing the LSU Tigers come our on top."
7580,Date of experience: November 2018,19-Mar-19,SEC,Louisiana,5,LSU STADIUM,Awesome experience had a great time nice friendly and family oriented stadium. The staff were nice and courteous best fans ever Geaux Tigers
7581,Date of experience: October 2018,27-Jan-19,SEC,Louisiana,5,The Mecca of college football,"If you have not been to a night game in Baton Rouge you are not really a football fan. It is the Mecca of football, everyone has to make the trip once in their lives in order to enter the kingdom of football heaven. Get any ticket, get their early, like 9 am, and enjoy. It??s not as great as it used to be due to ticket prices and parking issues but it is still the best football venue on the planet and I am sorry, Clemson, Auburn, Bama, Florida, Texas, Michigan, Ohio State been there and all have something to offer and great places to see a game, but Death Valley is on a different plane, a different level of drunken insanity and ritual not seen since the collapse of Roman Empire."
7582,Date of experience: October 2018,24-Jan-19,SEC,Louisiana,5,A football fans dream,"A Saturday night in Tiger stadium should be the highlight for ANY football fan,. NO experience like it! Just walking around the tail-gaters can get you an idea of why football reigns in the south!"
7583,Date of experience: November 2018,24-Jan-19,SEC,Louisiana,4,Great Place to See a Game,Went to the LSU Alabama game. Great atmosphere. Best tailgating anywhere. Very friendly people. Inside the stadium is amazing. Great place to watch a game and the crowd was deafening.
7584,Date of experience: November 2018,17-Jan-19,SEC,Louisiana,5,"The absolute best place to be during football season. The tailgating, the games and the stadium are top notch","An absolute great time!  The Stadium is top notch, the entire grounds are family friendly - a must see and do if and when you're in Baton Rouge!  Easily assessible from the interstate, lots of parking, plenty of restaurants."
7585,Date of experience: November 2018,16-Jan-19,SEC,Louisiana,5,Welcome to Death Valley,"Going here for any SEC Game is an experience that will have you wanting to return again, and again. Besure to arrive early with your favorite beverage for the Best Tailgaiting experience you can imagine. A fiendly enviroment even for visiting teams, and children will love seeing Mike in his habitat."
7586,Date of experience: October 2018,15-Jan-19,SEC,Louisiana,5,YOU??VE GOT TO GEAUX!!,"Going to a LSU home game is an experience like no other. The energy of the crowd is contagious. I??ve been to games where the fans rush the field after a win. You never know what will happen on a Saturday night in Death Valley. TIPS: Plan to get to the stadium early.. parking can be a nightmare and it will also give you time to walk around the tailgating parties where you??ll be offered food or a beer by plenty of people. LADIES: you cannot enter the stadium with a purse unless it is clear. No exceptions. They sell clear LSU bags for $20 (see picture) but you can find something cheaper elsewhere or pack light and forget the purse. If you are bringing children or don??t want to stand to watch the entire game, don??t sit in the student section. The sections near each end zone are usually laid back and not as loud. My boys (7 & 9) love going to games but personally, I wouldn??t bring kids under the age of five. It would be a long day for them.. and their parents. :) I hope this helps anyone interested in going! - Lindsey"
7587,Date of experience: October 2018,14-Jan-19,SEC,Louisiana,5,Chance of rain - NEVER,There is no place like Tiger Stadium on a Saturday night.  The crowd is getting ready during pre-game tailgating which is going on all over campus. Once inside the stadium - it's electric.
7588,Date of experience: January 2019,12-Jan-19,SEC,Louisiana,5,Stop to see,Of course when you are in Baton Rouge you have to go see Mike the Tiger or your trip isn??t complete. ????
7590,Date of experience: November 2018,12-Dec-18,SEC,Louisiana,5,It's Saturday night in Tiger Stadium!,"Attending an LSU game at night in Tiger Stadium should be on everyone's bucket list.  Descriptions fail to capture the noise, excitement, and the hair-raising energy of this stadium.  Spectacular."
7591,Date of experience: October 2018,11-Dec-18,SEC,Louisiana,5,Football,This is an awesome stadium and great atmosphere.  Their is nothing like Saturday night at the LSU stadium!!!!
7592,Date of experience: November 2018,23-Nov-18,SEC,Louisiana,5,Big League Stadium Now,"WOW! Recent construction expanded seating to 102,350. Also added private suites and big league multimedia game coverage. Really improved since I last attended a game there as a student decades ago."
7593,Date of experience: December 2017,22-Nov-18,SEC,Louisiana,5,Outstanding atmosphere,"Some of our best times while living in Lafayette La. involved a trip to Baton Rouge for an LSU game. First off folks in Louisiana know how to tailgate!!! The fans of opponents will be heckled yet most times be invited to join Tiger fans for food and drinks, just outright Louisiana hospitality! The Stadium atmosphere is electric.  I??ve watched the Tigers play the Gators as well as the Aggies. Both games were just incredible. GEAUX TIGERS!!!!"
7594,Date of experience: November 2018,20-Nov-18,SEC,Louisiana,5,The Home of the LSU Tigers Football Team,"Tiger Stadium is a massive stadium.  Seats over 100,000!!!  It is also know around the country as Death Valley.  LSU fans are some of the loudest in college football.  In fact many years ago after scoring a touchdown late in a game the roar was so loud from the stadium it set of a seismic gauge on campus.  Many of the seats are bleachers but there are many with seatbacks throughout the stadium.  The sound system is excellent.  What LSU football games are known for is the overall experince on gameday which includes tailgating which is known as being the best in collage football.  If you ever have a chance to attend a game at LSU please do so.  It is indicative of what college football game days are all about."
7595,Date of experience: November 2018,9-Nov-18,SEC,Louisiana,5,Very Good,"My 1st time to watch the LSU live and it was the best football game ever,i love the crowd and the people is just partying and having a good time..sure like to watch again one day.."
7596,Date of experience: November 2018,6-Nov-18,SEC,Louisiana,5,Best Place in Baton Rouge,"Tiger Stadium is the place to be on Saturday night in Baton Rouge! The crowd is loud, fun, and full of college football enthusiasm. The stadium holds over 100,000 fans and has an abundance of history. Any seat is a good seat!"
7597,Date of experience: November 2018,6-Nov-18,SEC,Louisiana,4,Great atmosphere,It??s an unbelievable and electric feeling..especially on a clear Cool night!The crowd is great.  The west upper deck bathroom for men needs to be managed better.  The also have issues w vendor carts right near the bathroom which impede the crowd flow.Make sure to stroll the campus long before the game.Most locals will invite you to join in the fun w some playful teasing.Worth a visit.
7598,Date of experience: December 2017,6-Nov-18,SEC,Louisiana,5,Feel the excitement!,Visiting Tiger Stadium for a night game is special!  Tailgating outside is remarkable.  Folks park there for days ahead of the game.  Some have private chefs cooking up great food others are catered by the many wonderful eateries in BR.
7599,Date of experience: November 2018,6-Nov-18,SEC,Louisiana,4,LSU vs BAMA,Stadium was amazing.  Fan were very wild and loud.  I would definitely recommend going to a game as you will not be disappointed.

7602,Date of experience: November 2018,5-Nov-18,SEC,Louisiana,5,Excellent Football venue!,"We have enjoyed visiting Tiger Stadium the past few times they have hosted the Crimson Tide.  It is super LOUD, but always quiets down by the end of the first quarter.  They are very hospitable to Coach Saban and the team, and t's also good for them to be reminded of who their daddy is. We look forward to every trip to Tiger Stadium."
7603,Date of experience: October 2018,24-Oct-18,SEC,Louisiana,5,Awsome Experience,"My daughter and I attended our first home game this year. What an awesome experience. We arrived early to walk through the tailgaters and visit the stadium before it packed out. The tailgating was pretty fun, lots of food and drinks with people more than happy to share. The stadium is an old college stadium, but it only adds to the mystique of LSU. The place was almost sold out but everyone was into the game and friendly. We had an absolute blast. The only complaint that I have is the ramps to get to the cheap seats it is a long arduous climb to the top."
7604,Date of experience: October 2018,22-Oct-18,SEC,Louisiana,5,Nothing Like it in the World!!!,One of the few places that the hair will stand up on your arms!!  There's just something about being in Tiger Stadium on Saturday night!!
7605,Date of experience: October 2018,22-Oct-18,SEC,Louisiana,5,Date night,"Great stadium, good food. They do serve beer inside the stadium, inside another secured area called The Chute. You pay $20 to get in The Chute and that comes with 2 tickets for beer (you have to drink it there). They do serve food inside The Chute. My husband and I were in town visiting so went to the game and it was fun! We bought a parking pass for $40, it was worth it. We sat in the parking lot for about an hour once the game was over and we were still in bumper to bumper traffic so have snacks in the car just in case! Overall, a great experience!"
7606,Date of experience: October 2018,16-Oct-18,SEC,Louisiana,4,Great venue,"A must see for a college football fan. Tailgating is scattered all over, so nice if you have a connection or know someone. The only complaint is entering the gates takes forever. They need to figure out how to add entrance points."
7607,Date of experience: October 2018,16-Oct-18,SEC,Louisiana,4,Great experience with the visiting team!,"First time at storied Tiger Stadium this past Saturday for the Georgia/LSU game. The home crowd was rowdy and raucous as advertised, but none the less, friendly and accommodating. This beautiful stadium is well laid out, with plenty of concessions and bathroom space. After my team??s convincing loss, multiple fans thanked us for coming, and wished us safe travels back. If only every visiting SEC stadium & fans could be like this!!!"
7608,Date of experience: October 2018,15-Oct-18,SEC,Louisiana,5,Go Tiggahs!,"Had a blast in Tiger Stadium for the LSU v Georgia game.  Beautiful day.  Loved the sky divers bringing in the US flag and the two other flags, very impressive show.  Then the fire works get everyone even more excited than they were already.  I love the tradition of the players and the band coming down the hill and then striking up the fight song.  Such a great way to start the game.  And who can beat our announcer, Dan Borne??.  The best!"
7609,Date of experience: October 2018,15-Oct-18,SEC,Louisiana,2,Love the stadium,"We are working on seeing every stadium in the SEC so when UGA was scheduled to be there we couldn??t miss it. Most of the LSU fans were extremely nice, the tailgates were awesome too. The reason for two stars is the fans do different cheers with vulgar language in it. We have traveled the south and have never heard such language during a cheer. There are kids everywhere hearing this nasty language so the administration should put a stop to it"
7610,Date of experience: October 2018,15-Oct-18,SEC,Louisiana,4,LSU/UGA game,We were from UGA and found the Tiger fans very fiendly and welcoming before and after the game.  A fun fan base!
7611,Date of experience: October 2018,14-Oct-18,SEC,Louisiana,2,Large stadium with disgusting bathrooms!,"We were there for Ga-LSU game. Huge stadium, but many negatives. Bathrooms were disgusting, even before the game. Concessions were very crowded and slow. Video screen way too small, and sound system was not good."
7612,Date of experience: October 2018,6-Oct-18,SEC,Louisiana,5,Best place to rock with the LSU tigers on Saturday night,"It??s magical.  Almost 100,000 of the best people in the world come to cheer their team on.  The golden band from tigerland is amazing.  Come early and tailgate.  So much ch great food."
7613,Date of experience: September 2018,5-Oct-18,SEC,Louisiana,3,LSU/Tech football game,"Where to begin... First recommendation is to find out about parking passes so you can park relatively close to the stadium.  We knew nothing about them and ended up finding a free parking area about 1 mile from stadium.  If you enjoy tailgating there is plenty to see and probably join in, if tailgating is not for you, I would not show up early. The later you arrive the farther away you have to park.  There are the people with bicycles and the carts to ride you to the stadium.  Not sure how much they cost.  Second, make sure you know which gate you should enter through to get to your seats.  We found ours easily, there was an elevator right inside to take us up to the level we needed to be on.  Our seats were literally the highest row possible.  If you have any disability or knee issue I recommended to do research on where your seat will be because the climb to the top is horrible.  Third, the stadium is very loud, the speaker system was difficult to understand where we were sitting.  After the game was over your choice on the upper level is to wait in a really long line for the elevators or walk down a winding ramp that is 1/2 mile long, then trek yourself to where you are parked.  Biggest take away, is to check into parking passes!!!!"
7614,Date of experience: October 2018,5-Oct-18,SEC,Louisiana,5,LSU vs Ol Ms,Great stadium but that walk up the ramp to death valley was reminicent of Marine Corp bootcamp ( im much heavier now)
7615,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Oct-18,SEC,Louisiana,4,Great time. Fantastic Atmosphere! Okay food.,"Best atmosphere in college football! Pre-game is phenomenal. The Chute is an added experience. Food is okay, but leaves much to be desired. Also restrooms not the best, but that is to be expected in a stadium. Geaux Tigers!"
7616,Date of experience: September 2018,1-Oct-18,SEC,Louisiana,5,First time visitor,This stadium is gorgeous. It seems to be very massive. Everyone was friendly. The grounds were clean and free of debris.
7617,Date of experience: September 2018,30-Sep-18,SEC,Louisiana,4,Never rains in Death Valley!,"The football game and stadium were great! Although, the staff weren??t very informative on how to get to the sections for seating! It took us forever making circles around the stadium before finding our seats. I also recommend getting there many many many hours early because traffic is horrible and most the roads are blocked off before and after the games!!"
7618,Date of experience: September 2018,27-Sep-18,SEC,Louisiana,5,"Awesome, NON-SMOKING, atmosphere!","Even though the place was extremely crowded, I was surprised how quick the lines were to concession and restrooms. Did not miss much game time at all waiting for these things. The atmosphere was phenomenal. Clean, exciting, and just a fun experience."
7619,Date of experience: September 2018,25-Sep-18,SEC,Louisiana,5,Great place to watch a football game!,"I always love visiting ""Death Valley"" with my kids and even more proud to be an LSU MOM!!!  The atmosphere is great!"

7626,Date of experience: August 2018,4-Aug-18,SEC,Louisiana,5,It's just LSU football and it's just a stadium.,"Yea, right. There's no better place on a Saturday night in the fall than an LSU game at Tiger Stadium. The atmosphere cannot be adequately described - you have to be there, feel it, soak it in to understand. With all due respect to many other fine schools and their football traditions, they all wish they could be Tiger Stadium because this place on Saturday night is like NOTHING else!!!"
7628,Date of experience: September 2017,9-Jul-18,SEC,Louisiana,5,Lousiana Saturday Night!,Nuff said! If you haven't experienced Death Valley on a Saturday night then you haven't experienced pure electricity. From the time the sun comes up and the first grills are fired up it's something special. The sensory overload that you encounter at the pre-game tailgating can only be matched by the sheer energy you feel when the Tigers take the field.
7634,Date of experience: November 2017,29-Apr-18,SEC,Louisiana,5,Tiger Stadium a great tradition,"You haven`t lived until you see a football game in Tiger Stadium!  This stadium home of the L.S.U. Tigers has been home to some the greatest football players in America. Such as the great Y.A. Title, Bert Jones, Jimmy Taylor and Billy Cannon and many more. When the Tigers play here this place rocks. A great place to tailgate and see and smell the good cooking taking place all over the campus. And the fans are the best. You can sample some of the best food in the world."
7639,Date of experience: October 2017,3-Mar-18,SEC,Louisiana,5,No other place like it,"There is no other place in the world like Tiger Stadium on a Saturday night. I know I may be biased because I??m LSU alum, but every person I??ve ever taken to a football game there has been blown away."

7644,Date of experience: November 2017,22-Jan-18,SEC,Louisiana,5,Beautiful stadium with a lot of history,"We love tailgating before the games at Tiger Stadium!  If it's a night game, we bring plenty of food and drink, set up the shade canopy and spend the whole day soaking up the atmosphere.  Tens of thousands of people having a good time, excited about the upcoming game.  Plenty of good-natured heckling towards the fans of the opposing team.  Even for a day game, it's hard not to at least drive through the area before kickoff to get pumped up for the contest.  The old stadium has had a number of face lifts over the years, and looks awesome today.  You owe it to yourself to experience game day at Tiger Stadium at least once!"
7645,Date of experience: October 2017,22-Jan-18,SEC,Louisiana,5,NO BETTER PLACE to spend a Saturday night!!,"One of the most hallowed places in college football!   If you can, go when it is a night game and when it is an SEC opponent - you won't soon forget it!   This is an item that should be on everyone's bucket list!  Mike the Tiger no longer goes into the stadium to be parked by the visiting team's entryway, but its also worth a trip to go see him in his habitat.  A magnificent mascot, for sure!"
7646,Date of experience: October 2017,21-Jan-18,SEC,Louisiana,5,Best stadium ever!,There is no other feel like being in tiger stadium on game day!  It??s a must try for everyone who enjoys college football!  Geaux Tigers!

We only got to see the grounds and the outside of the facility is immaculate. The outside of the stadium at night is lit up in purple and gold. Beautiful facility. I would love to attend a game here!
7648,Date of experience: October 2017,11-Jan-18,SEC,Louisiana,4,Roll Tide!,"I have been to Death Valley , as they call it, three times as a Bama fan and once as a Troy fan.  Bama is one of the few visiting teams that wins there a lot, but it is an intimidating place to visit if you aren""t a Tiger fan. The stadium rocks, especially at night! Fans are boisterous,  to put it mildly. They have a good time , and are passionate . Tiger Stadium seats over 100,000 and is considered one of the don't miss places to go as a football fan."
7649,Date of experience: November 2017,3-Jan-18,SEC,Louisiana,5,Seeing an LSU football game live is a must!,"LSU Tiger Stadium sits over 100,000 people.  It is also called Death Valley as it gets really loud during the game.  If you are an LSU football fan, going to a live game at Tiger Stadium should be on your bucket list!."
7650,Date of experience: December 2017,2-Jan-18,SEC,Louisiana,5,Enthusiastic Fans Create Great Energy,The enthusiastic LSU fans are amazing in that they go non-stop from start to finish.  It's impressive to look out over the impressive stadium and see a sea of gold and purple.  Everyone was friendly even though we were not dressed in team colors

7652,Date of experience: December 2017,28-Dec-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Da House of Dem Tigers,"This is where the tigers play, of course it??s awesome. Go see LSU??s mascot, Mike the Tiger in his multi million dollar enclosure. Not something your gonna see at many other schools around the country.  Visit during a home football game and just walk the school grounds to experience SEC tailgating at its very finest.  For the ultimate experience catch a game in tiger stadium on a Saturday night and understand why they call it DEATH VALLEY!"
7653,Date of experience: November 2017,23-Dec-17,SEC,Louisiana,3,Did not live up to expectations,We were there for a November nighttime game.  The crowd was lackluster and half of the food was not available.While we did tailgate prior to the game and enjoyed ourselves the stadium itself was not easy to navigate.After all the hype I heard I was expecting better.The crowds were abusive to the opposing team and some of it was uncalled for.  I understand the need to support your team and have been to 100+ football games and again this was a bot over the top for what was warranted. Not sure I will come back
7654,Date of experience: November 2017,22-Dec-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Best football experience in the SEC,"The LSU Tigers may not win every game they play in Tiger Stadium (although, they do win most of them), but they sure do a great job of providing the best football experience in the SEC. From the massive weekend-long tailgate that takes over LSU??s campus to the Golden Band From Tigerland??s famous pre-game show to a game crowd that??s the noisiest in college football, you can??t beat Tiger Stadium for football fun.Game day starts with a stroll around campus.  It??s insane!  All of Baton Rouge is there and everyone??s cooking, drinking and partying, waiting for 6pm when Tiger Band appears at the top of the hill to begin their run into the stadium.  Feel free to stop and visit at any party that looks like fun.  You??ll get fed and watered and made to feel like you??ve known these strangers your whole life.Once the band appears, it??s time to get to your seat.  Don??t have a ticket?  Neither do plenty of folks at the game.  Find a tailgate with a TV and join the viewing party.  There??s no blackout at LSU! If you do have a ticket, make sure you??re in your seat for Tiger Band??s world famous pre-game show. It??s an amazing experience and you??ll find out why the visiting team practiced with crowd noise on loudspeakers the week before the game.  Also - make sure to appreciate the Eye of the Tiger painted in mid-field ?? it??s done without a stencil! Of course, any SEC football game is exciting, so reviewing the gameplay is a no-brainer.  It will be a great game in a great venue. Once the game is over, the party continues outside making an LSU game day at Tiger Stadium one for the record books."
7655,Date of experience: December 2017,21-Dec-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Tailgating and Football,Best College Tailgating. Nothing like college football on a Saturday night in Tiger Stadium. Also see the beautiful multi million dollar Mike the Tiger Habitat while visiting Mike the Tiger.
7656,Date of experience: December 2017,20-Dec-17,SEC,Louisiana,4,The Legend!,"Everyone should experience a night game in October at Tiger Stadium!It helps to cheer for the home team.  However, no matter which team you cheer for the exciting atmosphere is real!They need to do a better job of maintaining the cleanliness of the bathrooms during the game.Further, they should monitor the drunks  more too.Most of the patrons are friendly and it should be on your bucket to watch a game here."
7657,Date of experience: September 2017,10-Dec-17,SEC,Louisiana,2,Checked it Off the List,"Unfortunately this stadium did not live up to it's hype.  The architecture very pieced together over the years and did not flow well.  For instance, if you are in the upper deck, you have to enter straight into the escalators right after entering the gate so you never have a chance to see any other part of the stadium.  The concessions were below average with a poor selection and even out of some of the few things they offered.  Not too mention, so many of the usual fans had no problem using frequent curse words even around children.  (I understand this can happen everywhere, but out of the hundreds various games I have attended, I have never heard a fan base swear so often.) If there is something positive to mention, it would be the parking on campus.  It is free and they do a good job of moving cars on and off campus before and after games."
7658,Date of experience: October 2017,26-Nov-17,SEC,Louisiana,4,Death  Valley,"It's the college spot for many pro football players and when the stands are full and fans are making noise, the opposing team quarterback can't be heard by team members and quite often, fails to make the first down or calls time out. It's a stadium where many football players have made their fame. The LSU fans are well tuned to every play and enthusiasm ensues at every game. There are washrooms at every floor and concessions are available both by stand vendors and inside. Box seats are available and some have catering. Tiger football fans tailgate at the crack of dawn before a night game and a party is evident at every tent and tailgate around the stadium.  Mike the tiger can be viewed in his jungle habitat.  Purple and gold are everywhere. The Tiger Band and Golden Girls are outstanding.  Its an experience all its own."
7659,Date of experience: November 2017,22-Nov-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Kudos from the losers,Great stadium and good fans-- the tiger mascot is a must see-- stadium food was fair -Baton Rouge is an easy city in which to drive
7660,Date of experience: November 2017,21-Nov-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,GEAUX TIGERS,LSU games are so fun with friends and family!! Make sure you tailgate!! Mike the Tiger??s cage is right outside of the stadium - don??t forget to visit this. Get there early before the game and line up outside of the stadium to see tiger band!
7661,Date of experience: November 2017,16-Nov-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,"A special thanks to Shawn & Doris for there great omelette with real eggs,","Great Location! Right off of Interstate 10, With in a block or two of a variety of restaurants and a Walmart. Thanks to the entire staff at the Embassy Suites by Hilton on Constitution Avenue."
7662,Date of experience: November 2017,13-Nov-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Excellent facility,"We came for the LSU-Arkansas game--for Hogs.  We were expecting a hostile reception, but this was one of the friendliest stadiums/experiences we have had in the SEC.  It was an 1100 kickoff, so that might have helped as folks had not yet been drinking.  We watched the LSU drum corps, the LSU & Arkansas teams exit the bus, visited the bookstore and loved the excitement and energy of the stadium.  The facilities inside were plentiful and efficient.  We took UBER/LIFT to/from the game. Afterward, it was hard to find transportation because of the traffic patterns, but we made it!!"
7663,Date of experience: November 2017,12-Nov-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Great!,"I went to the LSU vs. Arkansas game at 11:00 and it was so fun! However, it was very hot and I got sunburnt, but it was worth it!"
7664,Date of experience: November 2017,9-Nov-17,SEC,Louisiana,4,GO Tigers,Loud. Fun college day ecperirmce. Wow do fans get into games.  Fun atmosphere go of you get the chance.  Parking is a tough box to check off. Lots of homeowners offer parking in their driveway. Lots of driveways!
7665,Date of experience: October 2017,9-Nov-17,SEC,Louisiana,4,Plan Your Trip,"Like all SEC football venues, an LSU home game is a day-long experioences.  Folks pack up all their belongings arnd arrive early to set up portable sports bars in every parking lot with a half-mile of the stadium.The best way to get there and out in a timely manner is to park downtown and take one of the shuttles.  (I like the Pastime, but that's just me.)  Sure it takes forever, but at least you're not the one having to drive. (True story: the last time I tried to park my own car on the LSU campus for a home football game, a drunk in a pick-up jumped over two curbs from the street to pull into a parking space as I was backing into it from the parking lot. I said something I can't print here, and I might or might not have vandalized his truck after he staggered off to the stadium.  That's why I now shuttle from downtown.) If you must park your own car, your best shot is to take River Road to the campus and park in the vicinity of the vet school. Tailgaters are said to be very friendly.  That really hasn't been my experience, but you may be more gregarious. In any event, you want to go by Mike the Tiger's habitat and say hi.  (You won't see him at the game.) and get to your seat thirty minutes early.  The band's pre-game show is one of the highlights of the experience, and ususally much better than the halftime show.Fans are very passionate. If you're a visitor, you'll find that most fans are civil, but a significant number are just jackasses. And they don't take good-natured ribbing well. At all.So have fun. If you're an LSU fan, you know, so you won't be reading this. If you're a visitor, a lower profile will probably lead to a better experience."
7666,Date of experience: November 2017,9-Nov-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Best GameDay Experience,Tailgating to the next level.  Everone thinks their school is the best.  Come to Tiger Stadium for an SEC Night Game and see the difference.
7667,Date of experience: October 2017,9-Nov-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Welcome to DEATH VALLEY!,"This place is a huge facility and the fans are out of this world! The stadium reminds me of the roman coliseum, and people respect it as such. I think the best experience is the tailgating before the game. You can walk past a camp site and if they see you just finished a beer, someone will hand you a full one, no questions or money needed. Everyone is friendly and wants to have a good time! Even the people cheering for the rival team got along with the home fans. Definitely will be planning a trip back!"
7668,Date of experience: September 2017,8-Nov-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Tiger Stadium - one of the classics!,"The earliest parts of the stadium date back to the days of Huey P. Long, but I am afraid ??ol Huey would have a difficult time finding them today.  The University has made many additions and upgrades over the past decade that have made Tiger Stadium one of the best in the SEC!Be aware that day games before Halloween can be brutal. The sun seems to linger longer over the east side.  Look for seats on the West side, but if you are on the East side, bring a hat and sunglasses, and drink lots of water. The experience will be worth it,"
7669,Date of experience: October 2017,16-Oct-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Large!,Loved this stadium. It??s the largest I??ve visited and the fans can really make some noise. Small visitors section but that??s expected.
7670,Date of experience: October 2017,16-Oct-17,SEC,Louisiana,4,Pretty campus.,The campus is very pretty with the lakes and lots of green spaces. Wasn't overly impressed with the stadium. The tiger area was pretty cool and the fact they kept windows from the old stadium and keeping them maintained was nice.  Quite a place for football.
7671,Date of experience: October 2017,13-Oct-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Tigers,"Best place in Baton Rouge. Make sure to come for a game, and visit Mike the tiger. Not a bad seat in the house"

7673,Date of experience: October 2017,8-Oct-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,The place for College Football.,"Tiger Stadium is an amazing venue and there is nothing quite like watching a game of football there. Besides the Tigers are amazing, the organisation of events run smoothly. You would think with over 100,000 people in attendance that it would be tricky getting in and out of the venue. Nope, it??s easy and organised. We always walk to the game but I do understand that driving home from the game is a lengthy adventure."
7674,Date of experience: December 2016,7-Oct-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,LSU game,Got a chance to go to a home game at the stadium called death valley. The crowd was amazing and very friendly since I was in Miami Hurricane gear. The field is perfectly maintained and the stadium offers great vendors. You can also visit the tiger cage next to the stadium as well.
7675,Date of experience: September 2017,5-Oct-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Death Valley is fantastic!,Fun from beginning to end. Had a great time even though they lost. Snack stands are expensive. Halftime show is fabulous!

7678,Date of experience: September 2017,3-Oct-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Truly an experience not to be missed.,"What could be better than a pleasant evening in Death Valley? Watching a game with your team winning. This makes this a hit football destination for all team supporters. The crowd is loud and fun and the party continues inside, as well as outside the stadium."
7679,Date of experience: September 2017,2-Oct-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Death Valley!,We love college football and became Tiger fans a year ago when our daughter decided to attend LSU.  Watching a game at Tiger Stadium on a Saturday night is legendary.  It's a tough year for the Tigers but Tiger Stadium is still a great place to watch a game.  Geaux Tigers!!!

We were visiting family and had to stop by since it had been 7 years since our last visit. The campus and where Mike VII lives are just beautiful.

7687,Date of experience: September 2017,16-Sep-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Geaux Tigers,"If your looking for the best time in the south, attend a LSU Football game! The atmosphere is like no other around. It doesn't matter weather the Tigers are winning or losing, the fans are what makes the game. Get to the game 4 to 5 hours early and enjoy all the activities that are happening around the stadium! It doesn't matter if your from the visiting team or pulling for our Tigers, you will always feel welcomed!"
7688,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Sep-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,A Place like no other,"If you are a college football fan, you need to take a trip to Tiger Stadium a.k.a. Death Valley... This is truly a unique experience.  Plan on arriving early and walking through tailgates as most are eager to share their Cajun treats with the opposing fans.. Be prepared to take some good hearted ribbing."

7690,Date of experience: September 2017,13-Sep-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Great college football stadium,Great college football stadium! Great atmosphere. Dedicated fans and amazing tailgates! Upper deck goes very high. We sat in the lower end zone though. Great view. Good food and okay prices. No bag policy. Must be a clutch or a clear bag. Parking is bad on game day. Probably need to park and walk. The tiger habitat is right next door.
7691,Date of experience: September 2017,11-Sep-17,SEC,Louisiana,4,Tigerfanban,Attended a football game on a Saturday night was vibrant. The seats are fine but the concession area was rather congested. The fans are great and the excitement of the game gets your adrenaline going. Overall I had fun fun fun.

7693,Date of experience: September 2017,10-Sep-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,A Must When Visiting During Football Season!,"We went to Tiger Stadium for the Chattanooga game - the first home game of the 2017 season - since we evacuated for Hurricane Irma.  The on-campus atmosphere is great and I am convinced that next time we need to tailgate!  There were some tailgate setups that beat any I have witnessed in 20+ years of going to NFL games.  As for the stadium, be prepared to get to know your neighbors very well - in the seats, in the bathrooms, and in the concession line - and enjoy every minute of it!  Oh, and make sure you get there about a half hour early to sing ""Calling Baton Rouge"" with thousands of your new best friends.  Geaux Tigers!"
7694,Date of experience: September 2017,9-Sep-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,No one Knows How to Tailgate Like the Tigers!,I grew up in a family that loved football fans but these folks know how to tailgate like nobody's business! If it's game day plan on going about noon to Gran a spot for parking and to have a party. LSU gets my bite for best team spirit ??
7695,Date of experience: November 2016,7-Sep-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,The #1 college football venue in the world,"All of the opposing team fans that come in say the same, they are well received and have always been treated well by the #1 LSU fans. As a visitor, you can walk around before game time and visit with all of the people tailgating and they will feed you and offer you something to drink. When the opposing team makes a good play, even the LSU fans know enough to appreciate the skills of the opposing player."
7696,Date of experience: November 2016,7-Sep-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,You gotta go!,One of those must do items. The fans are passionate and you might feel the need to cover you ears at some point as the roaring of the crowd can be so loud!
7697,Date of experience: October 2016,26-Aug-17,SEC,Louisiana,4,Infectious Spirit,"I'm not an LSU fan, as I'm from an opposing team's state. I will say that being here with friends for tailgating and a game was an awesome experience. The town and the stadium come alive with team spirit. It was great fun!"
7698,Date of experience: November 2016,17-Aug-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Never rains in Tiger Stadium on Saturday night,"One of the great SEC Stadiums and probably the US also. No obstructed seats, and the noise level is where you want it to be (if you are a Tiger fan, LOL). Hugh scoreboards for play review and if you have connections you may even be able to witness the game from one of the well stocked club level boxes. Before the game you must visit the multimillion dollar habit of Mike the Tigers directly across the street from the stadium. For someone who has never been there the all day tailgating is an experience you do not want to miss. Most parties are very hospitable and will always invite visitors in for some great food and a little libation. The purple and gold exterior lighting is very impressive at night and truly shows off the stadium."
7699,Date of experience: November 2016,16-Aug-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,GOOOOOO TIGERS!,"If you have never experienced ""Death Valley"", time to put it on your bucket list!  The tailgating is some of the best.  You will find great food and friendly fans, until the game starts."
7700,Date of experience: August 2017,14-Aug-17,SEC,Louisiana,2,"Amazing energy, really cramped","This is a really subjective assessment of something that could probably be judged anywhere on a braid gray scale.  Personally I do not like Tiger Stadium.  It is cramped and it is really hard to get comfortable.  The LSU energy is amazing and there are few schools with the same spirit.  With that said, I'd rather watch a game from home when compared with going to the stadium (especially the vertical add on seating)."
7701,Date of experience: November 2016,8-Aug-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,"Nothing like being in a crowd of unbelievable fans, all there because of their true love of the University ??????","Anywhere you Geaux around campus, you will experience tastings of food you have never heard of and fall in love with the taste!"
7702,Date of experience: October 2016,8-Aug-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Nothing like Tiger Stadium on a Saturday night,"The Golden Band from Tigerland has a pregame show. Then the sound system plays Garth Brooks' Callin' Baton Rouge and 90,000+ of your new best friends sing along. Mike the Tiger comes in the electric screen and the football game is nearing! I go for the fun and the people watching as much as for the football game. Sometimes Intailgate with friends before the game but regardless, I always have a great evening in Tiger Stadium!!"
7703,Date of experience: October 2016,4-Aug-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Tiger Town,"Football season is on the radar very soon! Tiger Town, LSU Tiger Stadium is the way to roll! I can only relate to last year's season and hope that this year will be even better. The atmosphere is electric and the fans are fantastic! LSU is my heart in all sports and will always be so. My children are grads and my son-in-law played for an All SEC Team, so I have many memories of this stadium. Just buy a ticket and see what you think. See Mike the Tiger in his wonderful new cage and enjoy a real college football experience. We were so fortunate to be in one of the new sky towers with food and special features which are sponsored by the many wonderful companies in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. LSU is a special university and you will have a wonderful experience. Go Tigers!!!"

Competitors have said over and over that ""Death Valley"" is one of the most intimidating stadiums for them to play.  The noise level is overwhelming and the music is thrilling!  Tiger fans are among the friendliest in the nation.  We welcome our competition and love some good-natured bantering - but we're ready to share.  Come for tailgating before the game and I promise that you won't go hungry!!!!"
7706,Date of experience: November 2016,16-Jul-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,The reason for going to BR,"You can't go to BR and not see Tiger Stadium. It's historic, grand, and magical all at the same time. Get a picture with mike if he's at his cage."

7713,Date of experience: November 2016,5-Jul-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Earthquake loud,"Crowd noise actually registered as an earthquake on a Richter scale during one night game,  You have never seen a football game until you have seen an SEC night game in Tiger Stadium.  Tailgating is also in a whole different category at LSU. The party begins Friday night and lasts all day Saturday.  Some folks don't even have game tickets, but watch from their tailgate rigs.  LSU sports are big business, and football is the biggest of them all."
7715,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Jun-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Game day,"This stadium is magnificent. The fans are the best. What a experiance. If you have the opportunity to visit Death Valley, it's a must."

Tiger Stadium (aka ""Death Valley"") is the most rambunctious environment I have ever seen in college football to date. The tailgating is also a must. We hung out with a group for 6+ hours and just kept going to different set ups the entire time. Everyone treats you like family there and the food is incredible. This is a must do for any college football fan!"
7720,Date of experience: October 2016,24-May-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Football on Saturday Night!,There is nothing like the experience of being in Tiger Stadium on a Saturday night when the Tigers are playing.

There really isn't a bad seat in the place but of course the lower levels provide better views. Great concessions too!
7721,Date of experience: December 2016,24-May-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Death Valley. Like no Other,I know of no other experience like LSU Football on a Saturday night in Tiger Stadium! The colors of the field and the excitement and roar of the crowd must be like the Roman Coliseum! .

7723,Date of experience: September 2016,22-May-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,A Louisiana Tradition,"I've been going to Tiger Stadium since I was a little girl.  Both parents were alumni and so am I.  When the band steps off the goal line and gives the four corner salute in pre game, it is electrifying.  I've watched many great games here.  It is an experience that really shouldn't be missed. Both my children and their spouses are LSU grads and my granddaughters are already going to the games."

Went to see them play Ole Miss. The place was packed!!  Over 100,000 in attendance. There is no venue as loud anywhere in the world. The atmosphere is absolutely electric!!

7740,Date of experience: November 2016,10-Apr-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Death Valley,LSU stadium known as Death Valley is a awesome stadium.  Their student section is huge and pretty awsome.  They offer the clear bag policy so you man take things inside but it must be in a clear baglass or tote. The staff is so friendly and there are a millions places for parking and severbal buses that will come to get you to the stadium.  They are also wheelchair accessible which I love.

7745,Date of experience: October 2016,13-Mar-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Visit during game season and plan for a game to enjoy this place.,To enjoy this place you must come during game season (Fall/September-October) and plan ahead of time to attend a football game. The party begins in the morning and people bring their trailer and do barbecue and then attend the football in the evening. The view and the feeling inside the stadium is one of its kind...Tips: 1) If you did no book the tickets then chose a day when the team playing is not that great..After the game starts people sell their ticket for cheap and thats when you buy for cheap.2) Bring your jacket for evening game or you will be frozen..
7748,Date of experience: October 2016,1-Mar-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Go tigers,Just a awesome experience for all. From the tailgating  to the band and team coming down hill. To the stadium and game. We loved it
7749,Date of experience: October 2016,20-Feb-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Bama Alum that says Tiger Stadium is the best,"I love Bryant-Denny and it takes a backseat to no stadium, but it's true, Saturday night in Tiger stadium is special. The cheers are great, the fans are passionate (at least when not playing the Tide) but the shape focuses the sound so well that it creates the ultimate collage experience. If you have only one game to attend, go to LSU vs. Bama in Baton Rouge."
7750,Date of experience: September 2016,15-Feb-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Wow what a !place,"Going to an LSU football game in this stadium is so much fun!  The fans are so enthusiastic and the LSU band is amazing.  If you get a chance, come a couple of hours early and enjoy the tailgating activities going on all over the campus."
7751,Date of experience: November 2016,13-Feb-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Best College Experience,Tiger Stadium is a very special place for College Football.  An experience like no other.  Great Atmosphere.
7752,Date of experience: November 2016,13-Feb-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,SAT IN BR,"Saturday Nights in Tiger Stadium are awesome. The lights, the excitement, the band, and often have a great football game!"
7753,Date of experience: October 2016,9-Feb-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Great venue,"There is no better place in the world to be than Death Valley on Saturday night. In the immortal words of Coach Oeaux ""Geaux Tigers""!"
7755,Date of experience: November 2016,26-Jan-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Best College Football Stadium!,"The stadium is amazing! I would recommend purchasing a lower bowl seat, but the stadium does not have a bad seat.  You will enjoy every minute of an LSU game!"
7756,Date of experience: September 2016,18-Jan-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,BEST PLACE ON EARTH!!!!!,The excitement and energy level felt throughout Death Valley on a Saturday night cannot be beat anywhere!  I LOVE the when the first few chords of the LSU fight song is played by the band and the stadium just ERUPTS.  No better place on Earth.
7758,Date of experience: October 2016,18-Jan-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Saturday night in Death Valley~,You will never have an experience like an LSU game much less on a Saturday night.  Great fans and atmosphere.
7759,Date of experience: November 2016,17-Jan-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Saturday night football in death valley,"I had the time of my life. The atmosphere was amazing, the people were friendly. I love TIGER football."
7760,Date of experience: November 2016,11-Jan-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,College Football,"If you have never experienced a college football game Tiger Stadium is most definitely the place to see your first. From tailgating to the people to the game it doesn't get much better. There's a place to hangout pre-game for any scenario - couples, families, college aged, with food that is second to none. Of course southern hospitality is in abundance with friendly team banter mixed in. Once inside the stadium for kickoff the atmosphere is like none you have ever experienced. It's not nicknamed ""Death Valley"" for no reason! The decibel level is definitely deafening and not for the sensitive ear. Win or lose, the traditions of Tiger Stadium are a must experience at least once. If you don't walk in a football fan, you will leave one!"
7761,Date of experience: October 2016,4-Jan-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,Beautiful stadium & campus,I think everyone who likes college football has heard of Tiger Stadium.  It's a great place to be for a football game.  And the tailgating is fun - everyone is welcome.  The campus is beautiful and has many old oak trees.  Definitely worth a visit even outside of a football game.
7762,Date of experience: November 2016,3-Jan-17,SEC,Louisiana,4,Geaux Tigers!!!!,"We love the ""Death Valley"" stadium!  It is very organized and is able to handle a huge number of people really well.  I, and everyone else, wishes there were more food/drink venders (and ladies rooms) so the lines were shorter but that is my only suggestion."
7763,Date of experience: October 2016,2-Jan-17,SEC,Louisiana,5,a game in baton rouge,"I'm a college football fan and follow my alma mater religiously.  I was told no bucket list is complete until you see a Saturday night LSU home game.  I'm a Mizzou fan and some of the most unpleasant fan experiences I've encountered are in Lawrence, Kansas; Lincoln, Nebraska; Fayetteville, Arkansas and Norman, Oklahoma...but the Baton Rouge experience was wonderful and completely unexpected.  I've never been around nicer and more helpful people both before and after the game.  Other than horrible traffic, this was a terrific time for my family."
7764,Date of experience: November 2016,31-Dec-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,A night at LSU tiger stadium,Have been attending many LSU tiger games at the stadium and I've always enjoyed the time there.   Well the new improvements made to the stadium and we are continuing to improve the facilities around the stadium.   Some of the most gorgeous Oak trees on any college campus in United States.
7765,Date of experience: September 2016,27-Dec-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,LSU Tiger Stadium is unlike no other,"When a stadium full of fans can cause seismic activity because the fans are so loud, that is an incredible feat! Starting with the tailgating before hand, come on down because LSU fans are willing to share whatever they have on the grill! Look for the players and band to walk ""down the hill"" a few hours before the game. Get there early as thousands will line the short street hours before hand to see the players and hear the band. I encourage if you do go, read the history of the stadium i.e. Huey P Long. Then read about how over the years, the stadium now seats 103,000 die hard fans. If you plan on going to a game, secure your hotel room and tickets early!"
7766,Date of experience: December 2016,26-Dec-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Awesome to Walk Around,"The season is over in Tiger Stadium; however, it is still good to walk around the stadium. It is massive!  At one time there were dorms around the outside according to one of the plaques. It is worth a visit off-season just to take in the greatness of the place."
7767,Date of experience: November 2016,21-Dec-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Roll Tide!!!!!!,"Great stadium and tailgating atmosphere. Lots of restrooms. Fans are not kind to opposing fans, especially Bama fans. Definitely wouldn't bring a child to the game if you're cheering for the opposing team. You'd think after 6 years in a row they would be used to losing to the Tide. Definitely the loudest stadium I've ever been in until Jalen Hurts crushed their hopes and dreams in the second half."
7768,Date of experience: November 2016,10-Dec-16,SEC,Louisiana,4,They're nice to you if you're wearing purple and gold,"I live in New Orleans, but am not originally from Louisiana and my husband and I had always wanted to go to an LSU game. The atmosphere is full of energy. The stadium is impressive. The tailgating is unsurpassed. However, I was shocked to see LSU fans heckle the opponent's fans at restaurants, on the street, in the stadium, etc... I was raised to believe visiting fans are ""guests"" and should be treated as such.  I was dressed in my LSU clothes and was embarrassed to see my fellow LSU fans scream ""tiger bait"" and ""go back to Florida"" at the visiting fans. Overall, an amazing experience to go to a game in Death Valley, I just wish the LSU fans showed guests a little more class."
7769,Date of experience: November 2016,9-Dec-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Saturday night in Death Valley,"Trying to sum up the experience you will receive in Tiger Stadium is like equating the experience a child will have when they enter Walt Disney World for the first time except its for Grown ups. When  you enter the campus the smell of good ole cajun food passes across the whole property, which on a side note has been voted by ESPN and several other organizations as the top tailgating school in the Nation many years in a row. Local bands are playing, radios are blaring, and the excitement of the ensuing game creates an electric feeling all around the stadium. Many former college players that have been interviewed have stated that LSU is the hardest stadium they have ever played in because of the passion, noise, and intensity of the fans. Its a special place to be for any game but especially on a Saturday nights where the fans have been tailgating sometimes up to 3 days before the game and the old tradition stands, it never rains in Tiger Stadium. If you get a chance it's a bucket list experience, stop by and tailgate with some locals, go watch the players get off the buses and walk down victory lane before the game, or just enjoy the local hospitality and sportsmanship thats unique to any where else in the sport world, Tiger Stadium Death Valley."
7770,Date of experience: November 2016,9-Dec-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,An experience for locals and visitors alike!,"You just can't compare with the feeling of Tiger Stadium:  the noise, the excitement, the nachos!  :)  A returning favorite even for a local."
7771,Date of experience: November 2016,7-Dec-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,There is not place like Tiger Stadium.,"No matter where you are from your bucket list most include one Saturday night in LSU TIger Stadium, The fans, the energy, the lights . The most wonderful sports experience you will ever have."
7772,Date of experience: October 2016,28-Nov-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Such A Great Stadium,"I invited to visit Tiger Stadium. It was very awesome. I visited conference room, locker room, meeting room and of course the Stadium!!! I never know about the American football game before, and it such a great place that I have ever visit. You will see the supporter seats are gorgeous with varied color. I can imagine how spectacular would be when the game is in."
7773,Date of experience: October 2016,26-Nov-16,SEC,Louisiana,3,It's an experience,"I'm not a big sports fan, so I'm not experienced with many stadiums.  Being inexperienced, I read the Tiger Stadium rules before attending.  Being inexperienced, I expected the rules to be honored and/or enforced.The good: adequate restrooms and concessions.  Well organized for such a large venue.The bad: outside the stadium there is much smoking (on a tobacco free campus) and many porta-potties.  The porta-potty I used, came with thick cigarette smoke - the only thing I could smell was smoke...  We didn't find any bathrooms outside the stadium to accommodate the crowds - only porta-potties.  Inside the stadium the expectation to remain seated except for the momentary leaping to feet during exciting moments is not enforced and doesn't seem expected.  (We were not in the student section where I know they do stand, but in the high part of the stadium across from the biggest screen.  It seems that standing and visiting with friends and family is more important than seeing the field.)The amazing:  The concession staff were able to tell me what was dairy-free and called to verify ingredients when they were unsure - excellent customer service that we didn't expect at a large stadium.The unknown: parking.  Our LSU student picked us up from our hotel and drove us to his dorm parking area, so we didn't experience the stadium parking situation."
7774,Date of experience: November 2016,21-Nov-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,LSU Game day vs Florida,"This was my first experience at an LSU Football game. WOW! My boyfriend and I had a great time participating in some of the many traditions of a good ole LSU game day. Parking is crazy! If you can get a shuttle or carpool or cab, then awesome for you. If not, the plan for an early trip to the stadium. Folks are very hospitable at the tailgate.....even if you do the know them. The security is very professional and firm when/if they need to be. The student section is rowdy.....Yeah, we couldn't get over that and it was fun to watch. Any seat is a great seat. Try to sit on the west side or the side where the tiger eye is right side up so the sun won't hit you strait in the face. GEAUX TIGERS!"
7775,Date of experience: October 2016,17-Nov-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Death Valley,"No place like it on earth!  GEAUX TIGERS!  A fabulous place to tailgate and watch some football.  Doesn't matter if you're a Tigers fan or coming to watch an away game, you're going to have a great time.  This is college football at it's best."
7776,Date of experience: November 2016,17-Nov-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Great stadium but not great results for LSU,A great stadium - the box seating and food served is all very good . It was an electric game against Alabama . Great hospitality and awesome good .
7777,Date of experience: November 2016,16-Nov-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Nowhere else like it on a Saturday Night,"you can join over 102,000 of your closest friends (plus another 20-30,000 on campus) in Tiger Stadium...aka Death Valley...aka ""where dreams go do die""...all of the pageantry of big time college football in the most electric atmosphere...famous Alabama coach Bear Bryant said playing in Tiger Stadium is like being inside of a drum...best tailgating in America, amazingly friendly fans, and one of the most beautiful campuses around...if you are a major college football fan, Tiger Stadium must be on your bucket list...come on down to Baton Rouge and pass a good time!"
7778,Date of experience: November 2016,15-Nov-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Geaux Tigers!,Nothing better than Saturday night in Death Valley! Especially when Bama comes to town. Atmosphere and energy!!
7779,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Nov-16,SEC,Louisiana,4,Magic,"This is a one of a kind experience. Usually the Tigers win but even when they don't you will feel excitement pulsing through the stands. People watching and happiness of the highest order. Things start with 150,000 plus people tailgating. About 2/3 of them move into the stadium  where the sunset and nighttime views are beautiful. In the downside the bathrooms and concession stands are absolutely terrible. Most recent money has gone into making the experience better for big spenders leaving the ordinary fans stuck in dirty crowded facilities and long lines."
7780,Date of experience: November 2016,9-Nov-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Tigers!!!,"Yes I'm biased.  But I've been going to Tiger Stadium since I was about 3 years old, 47 years now.  It's grown quite a bit and time have definitely changed but it's still iconic."

7782,Date of experience: November 2016,8-Nov-16,SEC,Louisiana,3,Alabama vs LSU Game,The LSU fans are a tough bunch especially before the game but afterwards they softened and were much nicer.
7783,Date of experience: November 2016,5-Nov-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Game Day Baby,"BEAT Bama!!!!!There's no place like Death Valley on a Saturday night when the LSU TIGERS are on the field! This should be on every college football fans ""Bucket List""."
7784,Date of experience: October 2016,1-Nov-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Can't Be Missed,"You will never forget a football game in ""Death Valley""! Pretty darn amazing. The air literally vibrates when the fans start yelling."
7785,Date of experience: October 2016,31-Oct-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Great stadium,I went by the LSU store on campus and all of the young ladies were so friendly.  They explained a lot about the stadium so that I felt like I know LSU football and some of the traditions.  You will enjoy it too.
7786,Date of experience: October 2016,30-Oct-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Feels like home!,"I moved out of state in 2006 and have made it back twice to LA. A visit to Tiger Stadium brings back wonderful memories and always makes new ones. This trip was for the 2016 Ole Miss game. I brought a friend with me who is a Georgia fan and she was won over by the ambiance and thrill of ""Death Valley."" We started at Mike's habitat, visited the gift shop (she ended up in purple and gold!), strolled around and met a few friends at tailgate parties, then watched the band come down Victory Hill. Experiencing the combination of history (dorm rooms around the building) and Hollywood (star status of a famous venue) is addictive. Come early in the day(hungry) and stay late."
7787,Date of experience: October 2016,29-Oct-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,"Friendly, professional, fascinating","An amazing experience for a Canadian, as this type of devotion to university sport simply doesn't exist in Canada.  We were fortunate enough to be invited to watch the game in a sky box with our friends and the staff was extremely friendly and professional, the food was top-notch, and the atmosphere electric, with 101,000 people in attendance. For a visitor, this was an experience that won't soon be forgotten!"
7788,Date of experience: October 2016,26-Oct-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,This is THE PLACE to spend a Saturday night in the fall.,"The best place to watch a sporting event on the PLANET, period.  Of course I'm a bit partial as an LSU alumnus and as the place of my first (blind) date with the person who is now my wife of 33 years."
7789,Date of experience: September 2016,26-Oct-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Who doesn't love Tiger Stadium?,"There is nothing quite like being at LSU on game day. If you've never been to a game, you're missing out!"
7790,Date of experience: October 2016,26-Oct-16,SEC,Louisiana,4,LSU/Ole Miss Game,Our first time to Death Valley.  We enjoyed it.  We were opposing team supporters but everyone was nice to us.  It is loud so plan for that.  The stadium is nice and we had great seats.
7791,Date of experience: October 2016,24-Oct-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,All It's Made Out to be and More,"We made it a late trip decision to score tickets, parking and trek to BTR from NOLA. Was the first time, won't be the last. Got very good tickets on stub hub, initially thought we would be squeezed into bench seats. Fans around us an throughout stadium were great. Also had great food venues inside and the outside activity is the reason to return and start that party early."
7792,Date of experience: October 2016,24-Oct-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Best Venue in NCAA & SEC,If you are looking at this--I am sure you are looking for some parking tips. If it's a SEC game--get there early. It will be a mess an hour before game time and the traffic starts 5 hours before the game. Park on the western side of the stadium. More open spots on that side.
7793,Date of experience: September 2016,21-Oct-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,LSU Football game,I have been to many football stadiums throughout the nation but this is the most electric stadium I have visited
7794,Date of experience: October 2016,21-Oct-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Invigorating Experience!,Seeing the stadium fill with people wearing gold and purple with so much excitement one can't help but get in the spirit of football. These are fans love and stayed behind their team no matter what. It was a very fun experience that I am hoping to repeat!
7795,Date of experience: September 2016,18-Oct-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Death Valley,If you are a football fan there is nothing more exciting than a Louisiana Saturday night in Tiger Stadium.  The noise and the excitement are legendary and even the half time shows are great.

7799,Date of experience: October 2016,17-Oct-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Great Place for College Football,"We attended a game there last weekend, and had a great time. The stadium is typical, but the atmosphere is not. It is truly a loud place, which is what college football is all about."
7800,Date of experience: October 2016,17-Oct-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,No place like it on earth...,"Saturday nights in the fall in Baton Rouge are not complete without at least one trip to see the Tigers play.  The games are like their own set of theatrics...can't beat it anywhere.  Especially if the team being played is much hated by the fans...a famous quote likens Tiger Stadium to being like the ancient roman coliseum where gladiators fought to the death in front of a blood thirsty crowd!  If you can score tickets, don't miss it!!!!"
7801,Date of experience: October 2016,17-Oct-16,SEC,Louisiana,4,LSU vs Southern Miss 2016 !!,"Went to see LSU play Southern Miss in Tiger Stadium on Oct 15, 2016.My daughter took me and see knows her way around the stadium which definitely helped.First we parked out at one of the free lots and walked in.  Quite a walk, but when the game is over you can get your car out faster as opposed to parking in close.Joined up with friends at a tailgate party.  Food, drink, music, beer pong, bean bag toss, etc, etc.  Great time at the tailgate!!!At game time we headed in to the stadium.Needed one extra ticket so we waited outside the entrance gate and was able to pick up a last minute ticket for half price. Ticket was in the same section as our tickets so not problem there.Best not to bring bags or purses.  Bags must be see thru as well.If you don't have any bags, you can use the express ticket line which we did and were in the stadium quickly.Also they did not check closely (pockets etc) at the express line.  No trouble with a pint of refreshment in the pants.Found our seats quickly with the help of an usher and were seated in time to see the LSU band pre-game which is a must!!We had great seats and enjoyed the game.Concession stands were everywhere.  Not problem getting drinks and snacks.Definitely an impressive stadium !!The people are great !!Highly recommend attending a game there for the experience!If you find this review helpful, please give it vote!  Thank you!Go Tigers !!"

7808,Date of experience: September 2016,10-Oct-16,SEC,Louisiana,4,"Geaux Tigers, very cool!",Watch a football game for the first time in Tiger Stadium was pretty cool. It is a memory that will be remembered forever. The only negative point is the value of food and sold drinks and popcorn was withered.
7809,Date of experience: October 2016,5-Oct-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,No beer but great food and fans!!!,It was the greatest time ever!!  Spirited fans and outstanding football.  Felt sorry for the opposing team.
7810,Date of experience: October 2016,5-Oct-16,SEC,Louisiana,3,Great Sight Line,"Hated the ramps up to our sky-high visiting team seats, but have to say the view is good.  Believe we counted 18 ramps, plus another 23 rows to our seats."
7811,Date of experience: October 2016,4-Oct-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Great view of city,"Had to walk over a mile from parking area; left hotel 3 hrs. B/4 game-10 miles away. Stadium, once we got there, was clean, with elevators to out level, & hot dog & hamburger good."
7812,Date of experience: October 2016,4-Oct-16,SEC,Louisiana,3,Gigantic!,"Find out where your seats are before entering.  I asked how to get to mine & was given bad info.  We were the visiting team so of course our seats were at the top of the stadium.  I was told to walk up what seemed to be miles of ramps only to find we were on the wrong side.  Had to go all the way down & back up on the other side; was exhausted even before the game started.  View was great even though we were ""miles"" away from the field. Concessions were speedy.  LSU fans are very supportive & loud!"
7813,Date of experience: October 2016,2-Oct-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,SEC Tigerfest,"We went to the MU vs LSU.  Great fun, stadium, seating, 102,000 of your  closest friends and a terrible ending for the Tigers of Columbia, MO."
7814,Date of experience: October 2016,2-Oct-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Outstanding,"Just a must see collegiate stadium, especially on Saturday night! Great crowds, the best tailgating in the world, people having fun...but lousy post game traffic control."

7816,Date of experience: September 2016,29-Sep-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,FAN-TASTIC,"Of course with any longtime fan and soon to be graduate, this stadium in impeccable! We have not secured season tickets yet, so we bounce around the stadium quite a bit. I will have to say that sitting front row, directly behind the home bench is my favorite spot so far. We were able to interact with the players a bit and watched the game on the big screen when we could not see through the team. We even got a high five from SHAQ!!  Best seat by FAR!!!  Geaux Tigahs!"
7817,Date of experience: November 2015,27-Sep-16,SEC,Louisiana,4,It's loud!,Be prepared to walk and pay a ton for food :)It's a lively stadium with nosebleeds to boot!  The fans were nicer than I expected.
7818,Date of experience: September 2016,20-Sep-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Saturday night in death valley. Nothing like it!,"We attended a recent home game of the LSU tigers. It was an incredible atmosphere. It was big, it was noisy and it was gold and purple. This is an amazing venue to watch college football. It helps that we are tigers so we wear that purple and gold with pride. Easy to get to the venue. Great seating. Food options inside are what you would usually expect from a football game. Probably some room for improvement here. We can't wait to go back."
7819,Date of experience: September 2016,19-Sep-16,SEC,Louisiana,4,The Cathedral of College Football,"LSU on Gameday is one College football's must experience events. The stadium was built in the 20's and expanded to its current capacity of over 102,000. Night games are loud!! If you don't have tickets for a game, first try the is the official LSU ticket website. Tickets do come available. While the bathrooms and concession stands are looking very tired, they are slated to be renovated in the summer of 2017."
7820,Date of experience: September 2016,18-Sep-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Great as always,Tiger Stadium never seems to disappoint post game traffic has seemed to be much improved over last 10 years
7821,Date of experience: October 2015,13-Sep-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Most impressive football venue in this country.,"Visitors have remarked that they have attended games in other big-time stadiums so what's the big deal with Tiger Stadium ? 'Awesome' is a good word for it. You must experience it to understand it, especially an SEC game. There is NOTHING like the atmosphere in Death Valley for a big game. Tip; Be close at hand to watch the band march down the hill and into the stadium."
7822,Date of experience: September 2016,13-Sep-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,LOVE,"The best place on planet Earth!!!Loud, exciting, fun, amazing.Where opponents dreams come to die :)GEAUX TIGERS!"
7823,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,LSU Football,Nothing like the atmosphere in Death Valley on a Saturday night. Spend the day tailgating and visiting Mike the Tiger at his habitat just outside the stadium.
7824,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Best football venue in America!,Here is nothing like a tiger stadium experience. Getting tickets for any big game is extremely difficult but for other games it is possible to get descent seats at fair prices on day of game at stadium. Bathroom facilities are good. No alcohol.

7825,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,SEC,Louisiana,4,My LSU Game Day Experience??,"I had not been to an LSU football game in many years. I don??t care for crowds that large, and I??m not a huge LSU football fan although I do cheer for them when they are playing schools from outside of Louisiana. On Saturday evening, 9/10/2016, the Tigers hosted the Jacksonville State University football team. Thanks to a friend, I had excellent seats for this event.The attendance of the game was 98,389. To put that in proper perspective, that would be like taking every citizen of Youngsville, Scott, Duson, Broussard, Carencro, Maurice, Abbeville, Breaux Bridge, Cecilia, Crowley, Erath, Eunice, Jeanerette, Franklin, Kaplan, and Rayne, and putting them inside Tiger stadium at the same time. That number does not include the thousands of game day workers in the concession stands, security, stadium guides, band members, press, announcers, custodial/maintenance workers, etc.?? who are all there working behind the scenes to make sure we are safe and we all have a good time. That number also does not include the thousands of police and other security, and LSU workers in the parking lots and tailgaiting areas. I was told there are four shifts of police who work ONE LSU GAME.Traffic to the LSU game did not become congested until we were at the exit on the Mississippi River bridge. We waited about 10 cycles of the traffic light to get onto Nicholson. Once on Nicholson things went smoothly until we were right beside the stadium and then we realized that back up was only because there was a train coming through blocking the people who needed to turn right into the parking areas.We parked in lot 409 in an area reserved for people with handicap plates. There were four policemen and an LSU worker at this lot, one of whom was checking state ID cards to make certain there was a legitimate handicap person in every vehicle. The two cars in front of me, and the car behind me were turned away because they had borrowed the handicap hanging tags and did not have someone who could use that tag in the car. Good job LSU!!!When we left the car in the baseball stadium parking lot there was an LSU worker who asked us if we needed directions. He directed us to the CLEAN RESTROOMS inside the baseball stadium. It was at that point that I realized there were restrooms and port-e-lets all over campus, and they were clean and smell free.We walked over to meet a friend, then another short walk to meet another friend, and then another short walk to Walk-on??s Restaurant where we spent the next couple hours making new friends and staying cool, out of the Louisiana heat. Then came the hard, long walk over to the stadium and into our seats. There were hundreds of workers telling you where to go at every stage of entering the stadium. For a fan who goes often this may seem simple, but this is a large complex and it was nice for us to have people helping us so we didn??t walk the wrong way around the stadium adding an extra half mile to getting to our seats. We left early and stopped a few times as we watched the bad weather coming in.Bonus points to Tiger Stadium for having about 30 gates to enter the stadium, all of which appeared to be well organized. More bonus points to LSU for having an adequate number of CLEAN RESTROOMS, with the keyword being CLEAN all the way until the end of the game. More bonus points for having lots and lots of concession stands. In the third quarter I went to get a Diet Coke. From the time I left my seat until the time I was back in the seat was about 3-4 minutes.Before the game started there was a lightening/weather delay. The LSU people must be really accustomed to this happening. All 98000+ people got up and went under the stadium where you made new friends waiting for the weather to pass. The concession people seemed unphased and served up soft drinks as fast as people could order them.As for during the game the thing that impressed me the most were the traditions. Kudos to the LSU crowd for singing the Alma Mater and the National Anthem. It was nice when the crowd joined in the cheers LED BY THE TIGER BAND without any annoying announcer saying ??LET ME HERE YOU????. I loved the traditional pregame and I especially liked them showing the band on the jumbo-tron because we could not always make out the formations.The worst thing about our game day experience was the long walk back to our car. There was supposed to be shuttles running. An employee told us he had seen ONE!!! When you have a bad back, neck, and heart, and you have been out for a long day, it would have been nice to have that shuttle. Add to that the fact that my step-father is 82, and I will tell you that this was the hardest part of the day.I was semi-impressed with exiting the parking lots. The people there realize that there are so many people it is going to take a while. People were nice and polite letting other cars in line, and allowing pedestrians to cross in front of them. I??ll happily watch the next game in my house from the comfort of my recliner, but I??m glad we did this one time. If I was to go back to another LSU game I would want a hotel room at a walking distance hotel. I think that would make the experience even better.As it was I would rate this experience a 4 out of 5 and I am very tough when rating experiences"

Death Valley is indeed the BEST place you can ever be on a hot Louisiana Saturday. Once you enter the stadium, you are indeed MIND BLOWN! Over 100,000 fans drenched in purple and gold, screaming GEAUX TIGERS, taunting the opposing team. I spent my undergrad and grad years sitting in the student section chanting my lungs away, and wouldn't take it back for anything! This place is indeed great for families, children, teens, and people of ALL ages! There's absolutely NO bad seat in Tiger Stadium, NONE! Night games are are indeed the best, you have to experience it at least ONE time in your life! Once you attend a game at Tiger Stadium, there's no turning back.

7834,Date of experience: October 2015,16-Aug-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,There's Nothing Like Tiger Stadium on Saturday Night,"The best place to watch a football game on Saturday night (Day games just aren't the same).Then tailgating before the game is just as important to the experience as the actual game. You can find some great food all around the perimeter of the stadium. Tailgaters are willing to share with you (even to opponents). The food inside isn't that good so eat before entering. The stadium holds around 98,000 so the atmosphere is always great. Be sure to catch a game here as soon as you can.Oh and ... it never rains in Tiger Stadium."
7836,Date of experience: October 2015,29-Jul-16,SEC,Louisiana,1,Bad Food-Outdated Stadium,"Tiger stadium has terrible bathrooms, not maintained during games.  And the worst food in the SEC.

7855,Date of experience: October 2015,28-Jun-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Football game and tailgating,There is no better place to tailgate then at LSU and then be in the stadium when the band does the pre-game show. It brings chills to you every week when the band plays the fight song. Then there is always a loud and crazy crowd for the game.
7856,Date of experience: November 2015,28-Jun-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Even great when no game going on,This stadium is large and beautiful. Whether walking the exterior or enjoying an event you won't want to miss the experience.

7860,Date of experience: November 2015,22-Jun-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Geaux Tigers!,"If you want to have one of the best college football experiences of your life, go to LSU Tiger Stadium! Even if you are not a Tiger fan, the history behind the stadium and school are worth the visit. Known as ""Death Valley"", it was built in 1924 and now holds over 102,000 people. It is the home to many famous players such as: Billy Cannon, Tommy Casanova, Bert Jones, Charles Alexander, Jacob Hester, Odell Beckham, Kevin Faulk, Dalton Hilliard, Leonard Fournette, and many more. Mike VI , live mascot lives next door to the stadium in a state of the art habitat with a flowing waterfall, wading pond and lush amenities. All well worth a visit! I highly recommend for all ages!"
7862,Date of experience: November 2015,20-Jun-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Awesome,Try to get seats that are not at the top of the stadium  Lots of walking and climbing.  Take water to drink.  Usual concessions.
7863,Date of experience: November 2015,18-Jun-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,The best game day experience!,"We are season ticket holders for the Tigers, so I may be a little bit biased. Tiger Stadium is a great experience for Tiger fans as well as the opponent. Good views of the field all around. Elevator to get to upper decks. Concessions are quickly served and no more outrageous than other entertainment venues. Bathrooms tend to fill up at halftime so avoid that time if possible."
7864,Date of experience: August 2015,12-Jun-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Tiger stadium speaks for itself,"Never been disappointed here! Lsu alumni... Geaux Tigers!! Stadium is great , food is great, there isn't anywhere in the stadium that you can't see. There are NO bad seats! It is loud though... Plan for that"
7865,Date of experience: October 2015,9-Jun-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Fooootballll!!!,This is an amazing experience! This stadium is massive! The food choices are plenty and really cool local options as well as standard stadium finds. When the PA announcer speaks and all the boards light up - it feels like home! Regardless of your sports preferences and teams -- you should visit this awesome place at least once!!! Oh... And the tailgating on the walk up to the stadium ... Remarkable! Awesome! Unbelievable!!
7866,Date of experience: November 2015,5-Jun-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Great game and awesome atmosphere,I went to a game here to experience the atmosphere of the swamp and I was impressed by the advent fans. The food was good but the tail gate was the real gem. No matter where you are on campus people are willing to offer you a meal and talk with you. Great atmosphere and you need to visit this place if you are a college football fan.
7870,Date of experience: November 2015,1-Jun-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Best college football experience,"I have attended college games at LSU for over 50 years as a young fan, student, and season ticket holder. A night game at Tiger Stadium, particularly one against a top opponent, should be a bucket list item for any sports fan. I had guests from Sweden attend a game with me in 2015. It was their first college football game, and they marveled at the pregame tailgating and the game environment. They said their experience was ""unbelievable"" and unlike anything they had ever attended."
7872,Date of experience: October 2015,31-May-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,No Place Like Death Valley,Always a good time in Death Valley. Can't beat it on a Saturday night. ELECTRIC!!!!

7876,Date of experience: September 2015,23-May-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Absolutely the Best !!,"Tiger Stadium & LSU Football are absolutely the best game day experience in college football. My daughter was in the band and graduated from the University of Texas. Our family attended 4-5 home games each year while she was in school.  I thought that was way cool until my son decided to attend LSU.  My wife and I go to a couple of games a year and there is no better tailgate or game day scene than LSU.  The stadium itself is an iconic, legendary college football stadium.  It has recently undergone major renovations enclosing the south end of the end, increasing the seating capacity and building lots of new suites.  It is a beautiful stadium with a great game day vibe.  I've been to college games all over the nation having been a high school football coach myself, but there is nothing better than a night game in Tiger Stadium.. Death Valley.  Attending a LSU football game at Tiger Stadium needs to be on every college football fan's bucket list."

7879,Date of experience: November 2015,17-May-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,There's no place like Tiger stadium,"My girlfriend and I have season tickets. We go to all of the home games and a few of the road games. In all of the stadiums I've been, none comes close to Tiger Stadium. I do not say this just because I'm an LSU fan. Because of my job, I have been able to visit many sports venues over the last 40 years and nothing comes close to the LSU facility. The fans are some of the best and most hospitable I have encountered anywhere in the country and are supportive of LSU even during losing times.....although they will express their displeasure with losing. Once you've been in the stadium during a game, you will compare everywhere else to this place."
7884,Date of experience: October 2015,1-May-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Amazing place!,It is always an adventure in Tiger stadium. If you've never been to a game there you're missing out on a great time!!!
7889,Date of experience: November 2015,25-Apr-16,SEC,Louisiana,1,Too Many Drunks,I do not recommend.any one with children take them to an LSU football game. We went with my brother and wife with my two boys. The language used by all in the stands is embarrassing . Too much alcohol for too long before the game. Everyone raves about Tiger Stadium but don't bring the kids
7890,Date of experience: September 2015,22-Apr-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Like no other,"I've been to a lot of big sports stadiums around the world, but the vibe, support and team spirit in this place is incredible. Not to mention the noise. If you get the chance to go, you should!"
7891,Date of experience: October 2015,21-Apr-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Awesome experience,There is nothing to compare a Saturday night in Tiger Stadium.  The atmosphere during a game is off the charts.  All fans local and visitors are treated with much respect and welcomed ever if a visiting fan.

7903,Date of experience: November 2015,11-Mar-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,No place like it anywhere!,Every college football fan should go to an LSU home game at least once.  It is an experience that has a flavor all it's own.
7904,Date of experience: January 2016,6-Mar-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Gotta see it!,"Best to go to a Football game and Tailgating experience. Even if not at game time still a sight to behold. Enormous! At night its lit up in Purple and Gold. Mike the Tiger Habitat is cool. I'm an Auburn fan, Hate Alabama, LSU folks are as passionate as any I've ever seen."
7905,Date of experience: November 2015,24-Feb-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Death Valley/Deaf Valley?  Doesn't matter.  Tiger Stadium is LOUD and fun!!,"If you ever get a chance to attend a football game in Tiger Stadium, you should take it.  A game here is like none other.  Tiger Stadium is the loudest stadium in the US and if the Tigers are winning the noise is deafening.  LSU is known for tailgating so before the game (which are held at night unless the TV schedule interferes).  Fans start setting up the night before and by Saturday morning, the entire campus turns into a giant festival of food and beverage. LSU also has a great marching band and one of the best football traditions at LSU is all about the Golden Band from Tigerland.  Before every home game, the band marches across campus from the bandhall to the stadium.  At the top of the hill next to the stadium, the band stops (to give fans time to clear out of the street) and then runs down the hill and into the stadium playing the LSU fight song.  Once it's game time, the band is back on the field for the pregame performance -- a ritual that can only be experienced, not described.  (google tiger band pregame).  Then the game starts.  Partying continues after the game.  Best college football experience ever!!"
7909,Date of experience: September 2015,14-Feb-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Saturday Night in Death Valley,"College football is a tradition across the South, and LSU is no different.  However, there is no stadium in the world quite as impressive as Tiger Stadium, otherwise known as Death Valley.  One of the largest stadiums in the country, Tiger Stadium is also one of the loudest.If you're looking for a crazy crowd experience, definitely get seats down in the lower portion of the stadium.  However, if you're wanting more of a subdued experience, seats in the South End Zone Expansion tower way above the crowd and allow a great view of the field; those seats also look out over the Mississippi River Bridge and have a great view at sunset.Tiger Stadium is one of the only major college football stadiums I know of that offers a ton of free parking for fans, which is another plus.I'd recommend showing up well before game time to also get some time in tailgating and getting the whole day's worth of football experience."
7910,Date of experience: September 2015,13-Feb-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Greatest Sports venue in the US,What a great place to watch a college football game even if you are not an LSU Tiger fan! Fans come for days before the game to tailgate and cook some wonderful food!

We got directions to the stadium which were perfect. After spending some time with Mike we went to the LSU store and bought some shirts and shorts. When we were taking a picture with the statue of the LSU tiger a very lovely lady student offered to take a picture of my squeeze, the tiger and me. Turned out perfect. Geaux Tigers."
7914,Date of experience: October 2015,14-Jan-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Famous Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge!,"If you are even in Baton Rouge during College Football Season, you owe it to yourself to attend a game here.  The excitement that builds around this stadium starts long before you get inside.  The tailgaters are stationed all over the place, and there is lots of good food and drink to be had by all.Once inside the stadium, the excitement is so thick, it can be cut with a knife.  The traditions in the stadium are long held, and the fans are indeed cheering at a fever pitch.LSU football has a long history of producing quality teams, and it shows here at it's finest.DON'T MISS A GAME HERE!"
7915,Date of experience: November 2015,14-Jan-16,SEC,Louisiana,5,Greatest place to watch college football,Anyone traveling to Baton Rouge must stop in and check out Tiger Stadium.

I have had (or sat in) great 45 yard line seats in Tiger Stadium since I was about 9 years old, sitting now with grand children of the folks with whom I first sat. A night game in Tiger Stadium is, very simply, an incomparable experience -- even if you find yourselves in the cheap seats. Come tailgate & have a rockin' time. oh, and by the way, GEAUX TIGERS!!!!!!!!"
7921,Date of experience: October 2015,31-Dec-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,This should be on your bucket list!,"Ok, so I grew up in BR and graduated from LSU, so I have been to more LSU football games than I can count. If you have never been to a game in Tiger Stadium, you must! This is the best place in the world to watch a college football game. The atmosphere is electric! It all begins with a visit to Mike the Tiger's amazing habitat outside the stadium and then tailgating where the friendly Tiger fans will offer up delicious Louisiana food; however, if you're for the opposing team, do not expect that friendliness to be extended once you enter the stadium. LSU fans are rabid and love their Tigers! Be sure and be in your seats in time for the Tiger Band's entrance. They are truly the best college band in the land! If you have an option, choose an SEC night game. This is a must for your bucket list! GEAUX Tigers!"
7922,Date of experience: November 2015,27-Dec-15,SEC,Louisiana,4,Death Valley game day!,"We visited LSU for the Kick Off LSU college tour.   Since I am a graduate of U of Arkansas, we went to the game that Saturday.   I'd heard major horror stories from people (Arkansas fans or not) regarding their experience at Death Valley while cheering for the rival team and they were NOT pretty.   I didn't dare wear my Hog gear and went neutral with an SEC shirt.   The game was awesome!   There quite a few characters sitting around us that were very unhappy with the game outcome.    For the most part, the experience getting in and out of the stadium was fine.   I didn't see anyone getting harassed about their team choice.    I will say that I just bought tickets to the game, not a parking pass (not an option with my tickets).   I thought it was no big deal, we'd just get an Uber or park and walk far.    When I arrived for the campus visit, I was told to find a parking pass (none available at that point!).   The roads in and out are all flowing one way for a 2 mile radius (limited options for getting to stadium).    We ended up getting passes for the Touchdown Express and it went smoothly.   If you have no clue about the Baton Rouge area, LSU, game day, etc., be sure to get parking passes.   If not, we thought the Touchdown Express was a great option."
7923,Date of experience: December 2015,27-Dec-15,SEC,Louisiana,4,I lived under this stadium!,"This stadium is a wonderful place to see athletic events, but there is a lot more to the stadium than that.  The space under the bleachers has long been used as men's dormitories at LSU.  The story is that Huey P. Long, the state's Governor, Senator, and political strong man back in the day (1920's and 30's) wanted LSU to be affordable (it was) and he hated to see waste.  He was also a big LSU football fan.  LSU wanted to expand the stadium seating capacity, but there was no money for it in the state budget.  However, there was money for more dormitory space.  Huey Long gets the credit for enlarging the stadium and building dormitories under the bleachers, but according to ESPN, it was the Tigers' athletic director who originated the idea.  Since Huey supported it, it quickly got done.  I lived in the North Stadium Dormitory in 1960-1961.  We had a huge room, because we were at ground level.  Because of the geometry of the place, rooms in each succeeding higher level got smaller.  We shared a bathroom down the hall.  We had no air conditioning, but we were on the shady side and there were huge masses of concrete above us to soak up the solar heat.  I lived there for a full semester for a total rent of $ 72.00!  I was a member of the Tiger Marching Band, so I didn't have to worry about noise on game days.  I was out there helping to make the noise.  I am sorry to see that the stadium no longer houses dormitories.  It would be hard to rent such spartan quarters now.  Louisiana State University was one of the finest values in higher education in the country when I went there in the early 1960's."
7924,Date of experience: December 2015,26-Dec-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,This is a place like no other,"I love LSU, and everything it stands for,  I was in the marching band back in 1985 and that was my first experience at Tiger Stadium and it has never left me.  The place is very exciting, inspiring, fun and offers a feeling go belonging.  I get chills every time I go.  This is an awesome stadium, and a place I look forward to always going there."
7925,Date of experience: October 2015,25-Dec-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,You need to visit Death Valley...,Home of the LSU Tigers... This has to be a game day for any college football enthusiast. A must for the bucket list...But the tailgating is even better....
7926,Date of experience: September 2015,24-Dec-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,OMG!,"Going to a game here is just amazing! There is so much to do before the game outside the stadium. Once inside to stadium, especially when it is sold out is something to see and hear. Great place to be on a Saturday night!"
7927,Date of experience: December 2015,22-Dec-15,SEC,Louisiana,4,Excellent,I loved the experience at LSU it was spectacular. Me and my boyfriend enjoyed ourselves. We had to come back and vist it was a must.
7928,Date of experience: October 2015,22-Dec-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,LSU Football Game is a Must if You're in BR,There's no football game like an SEC game and LSU is at the top of the list for great stadiums and great tailgating!  This is a must do if you've never experienced Tiger Stadium.
7929,Date of experience: December 2015,20-Dec-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Unmatched,"I've been to many many stadiums for all sports, maybe I am biased because I'm a tiger. The tailgating, food, parties, the crowd, just a great experience."
7930,Date of experience: November 2015,17-Dec-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,"Loud, but crazy fun","The team spirit of the LSU fans is like no other. Young and old are high spirited sports fans. At one time, the cheers were so loud until my ears started to ring. The stadium should be called Deaf Valley instead of Death Valley, but it's all good. Upbeat top hype music was played throughout the game. Parking can be challenging, we stayed at the Hilton hotel downtown and paid for shuttle pick up and drop off to the stadium. There are tons of parking options to park on private resident lots, but I noticed that the cars were left unattended.Although we had premiun seats, it doesnt appear to have any bad seats in the stadium. However, my husband and daughter sat in the row directly behind my son and I, but our row had more leg room.The bathrooms were clean and they had plenty of concession stands. The stairs seemed a little slippery because of light rain. Much more fun and better stadium than at The Ohio State Buckeye game."
7931,Date of experience: December 2015,16-Dec-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,I touched the tiger and it touched me back,The architect did a great job. You must be Rich if a gate is named after you . Next time you visit the stadium go in the TC gate and think of me.
7932,Date of experience: December 2015,15-Dec-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Go!Tigers!,"Lsu Tiger's stadium is second to none.The fan base is awesome, the stadium is a little over 100,000 seating area, however the tailgating outside the stadium is just as big. The fans are great. Great tailgating food and friendly people make for a day of fun and good cheer.No matter if it's football, baseball, track and field or a country rock concert LSU is a happening stadium.If your in Baton Rouge it's a must see and while your at it you must see Mike the Tiger. G-Man ??"
7933,Date of experience: November 2015,11-Dec-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Best Stadium EVER!!!,LSU is by far the premier location for college sports. Great atmosphere and great fans. Be sure to enjoy the tailgating before the game.

7935,Date of experience: November 2015,1-Dec-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Best Stadium for College Football,"Tiger Stadium is the best atmosphere for college football in the country.  From the tailgating outside the stadium, to the band's pre-game performance, to the game itself, there is no better place to enjoy an afternoon in the fall.  Each year people from all over the country with no ties to LSU come to Tiger Stadium to experience game day in Baton Rouge."
7936,Date of experience: November 2015,1-Dec-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,We're all about it!,"You first see it as you travel east over the Mississippi River bridge into the city!  For LSU fans anywhere, it IS the destination."
7937,Date of experience: November 2015,29-Nov-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Death Valley 5 Star!,"First time to visit this stadium.  Excellent stadium for college football. Crowd was electric, this has to be one of the loudest stadiums in college football.  Parking was easy and close to the stadium. Not hard to get in or off of the campus.  The stadium seats were better than other stadiums.  They were individual seats that folded down and have a back to them. Enjoyed the visit."
7938,Date of experience: November 2015,25-Nov-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,LSU Football,"No better place in the world to watch football! No matter who they're playing, who's coaching, how the team is doing, etc... This is the best. Sorts fans should make it a goal in life to visit Tiger Stadium on a Saturday. Best fans, food, fun, atmosphere there is. I've been to many campuses around the nation to watch games and the REAL Death Valley tops em all!"

7941,Date of experience: November 2015,15-Nov-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Best stadium in college football,"I have been to many other stadiums to watch college football. However, there is no place like Tiger Stadium, a.k.a. Death Valley, for college football on a Saturday night."
7942,Date of experience: October 2015,14-Nov-15,SEC,Louisiana,3,Stadium Club is amazing,Great food with lots of options and snacks but you will spend a lot on the alcoholic drinks. . Their shots are equivalent to a half shot

7948,Date of experience: October 2015,27-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,WOW,"I am sure it would have been better if it wasn't pouring rain, but if you are a Tigers fan and never been to Death Valley rain or shine one word GEAUX! We had seats in section 617 (take the elevator) seats were on the 30/35 and a great view. Even without my binoculars you could see great! Concession prices we found a little high compared to some stadiums. We thought nachos were the best deal. All in all we can't wait to go back!"
7949,Date of experience: October 2015,26-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Suite visit,Got to experience a game from the comfort of the suites at tiger stadium. The food was great and the service even better. It was a cool place to hang out. Hopefully we will get the chance to return in the future.
7950,Date of experience: October 2015,26-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Best stadium,Tiger Stadium is always loud with fans cheering the tigers on to victory.  Definitely one of best stadium facilities in country.
7951,Date of experience: October 2015,26-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,A must see to do in Baton Rouge,If you are in town for a LSU college football game you must take the time to walk around and see the sights. It is truly something amazing to remember .
7952,Date of experience: October 2015,26-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,LSU vs Western Kentucky,"Attended LSU vs Western Kentucky game.  It was a rainy day, but we still enjoyed tailgating and the game.  We tailgated in the Levee Lot (free)...great location to tailgate at."
7953,Date of experience: October 2015,26-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Brad & Chloe Wedding,Had a few hours to go and enjoy the beautiful campus - what a treat!  Love love the trees!!!  Enjoyed riding through student union and seeing those setting up for game weekend!
7954,Date of experience: October 2015,26-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,LSU homecoming,Despite rain great experience.   Death Valley stadium is a must experience for all college football lovers
7955,Date of experience: October 2015,26-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Saturday Night at Tiger Satdium,Can't beat the tailgating and Saturday Night Football at Tiger Stadium. Don't judge all of the fans by just a few. You will find the majority very friendly and hospitable.
7956,Date of experience: October 2015,26-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Amazing experience!,"Always wanted to attend a game at Death Valley.  The stadium was a sight to behold!  The crowd was great, there was a nice variety of food to buy, the restrooms were never crowded.  It was a very enjoyable experience!"
7957,Date of experience: October 2015,26-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,A great staycation,"Stadium filled with a lot of friendy and family oriented people. My son truly enjoyed himself. We will be returning to Baton rouge, La again"
7958,Date of experience: October 2015,25-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Amazing,There's no place like Tiger Stadium. The atmosphere is unlike any you will find elsewhere.  Even in the pouring down rain the fans packed the stands to  cheer on our Tigers!!
7959,Date of experience: October 2015,22-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Amazing Football Stadium,"It was easy to get into the stadium, security was fast.  They have an excellent elevator system that brings you up to the upper levels.  After the game we were only in line for the elevator for 5 minutes and out of the stadium in no time.  The signage was very easy to follow and the stadium offered plenty of concessions that moved lines quickly.  There are plenty of bathrooms but with 103,000 fans the lines will back up."
7960,Date of experience: October 2015,21-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,In town for the South Carolina vs LSU game,The drive from the stadium was about 6 minutes. Left at halftime so the traffic was good. It's Death Valley! What more do I need to say!!!
7961,Date of experience: October 2015,21-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,4,LSU-FL football game,"Overall a friendly environment but I would suggest more directional signage and additional access to the visiting team ""nose bleed"" sections.  I am in shape but broke a sweat climbing almost 20 minutes up the ramps to our section then another 5 minutes straight up steps!"
7962,Date of experience: October 2015,20-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Simply Spectacular,"Not just a football stadium. Saturday nights in Death Valley are an experience not to be missed.  The experience actually begins long before the game by walking the grounds and experiencing the tailgating.  I may be partial to the Tigers and say that we do it bigger than any other, but if you are not at least familiar with SEC tailgating, you need to experience the scene at LSU. The excitement builds throughout the day and culminates with one of the loudest and most raucous college environments you will ever see.  I loved every minute of it, and only wish I could get there more often.  The only negative - the fountain drinks inside the stadium are awful."
7963,Date of experience: October 2015,20-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,First Game in Death Valley,"It was a good experience..We had endzone seats..on the ground level..it was cold the stadium is outside , so take a jacket..getting in and out was not too bad..the concession were a little pricey for cold popcorn and drinks.."
7964,Date of experience: October 2015,19-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Tigers Gator game,"We bought tickets in the summer thinking Florida would not be competitive in the game.  The resurgence of the team under Coach McElwains guidance made this a great game to go and watch.  The fans were great before and after the game and we had great seats on the 48 yard line Florida side.  I encourage any fan of the game to visit this venue.  We had a great time, but i did not think it was nearly as loud as the Swamp."
7965,Date of experience: October 2015,15-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Unforgettable LA Saturday nights!,"Saturday afternoon tailgating is a great prelude for all fans. Southern hospitality is abundantly there without asking for it. Night games are magical, loud and just plain electric in Death Valley. Lots of food choices are available once inside from the usual options to local favorites. Don't have ticket? Consider walking over to the game with a seating chart in your pocket. I usually go for no more than face value on tickets. Enjoy yourself at one of the consistent top 5 experiences in college football! Geaux Tigers!"
7966,Date of experience: October 2015,14-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,It's the 8th Wonder of the World,"Tiger Stadium is home to the LSU FOOTBALL TEAM and around 100,000 rabid fans. The experience starts long before you get to your seat. Parking can allow you to hike a few miles or pull right up if you can score a sacred parking tag. Get out of your vehicle, car, bus, mobile home or rickshaw and take in the fragrance of thousands of tailgaters. Depending on the visiting teams mascot, will tell you what's on the menu I.e. Razorbacks, Gators but not Dawgs (other than hotdogs)!  If your visiting to root for the OTHER team, expect to be called "" Tiger Bait"" but expect to be invited to partake of all the tailgate delicacies. Even Ole Miss fans sometimes get invited to eat. Fast forward to THE TEAM marching down the hill past the Pete Maravich Center followed by the Golden Band from Tigerland. Enter DEATH VALLEY, seats climb from field level to the sky. Great views everywhere. Concessions are standard. Some years, they get adventurous and sushi or other oddities appear. After the bands amazing pre-game march on the fied, the fireworks really start!  This review is not a spoiler alert but the crowd I'd the oldest noise you ever heard. Their passion once caused an earthquake. If you love football, whether you love or hate LSU, Tiger Stadium is #1 on most sports bucket lists. Not over yet, the last weekend in May is BAYOU COUNTRY SUPERFEST which has become one of the top weekends for country music anywhere. It's huge but you feel like your right next to Taylor, Reba, George or Zac and The Lady. Tiger Stadium will always imprint great memories within you. And just across the street is the guardian of the holy site, MIKE THE TIGER. GEAUX visit...."
7967,Date of experience: November 2014,10-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Awesome experience,Couldn't believe how much this city loves their tigers. The entire area around the stadium is a giant tailgate party.  Doesn't matter how old you are as long as you bleed purple and gold you can party with them.  If you are a football fan you must experience death valley at least once.  Not to mention the food in the stadium is excellent. Eating jambalaya and watching football. AWESOME!
7968,Date of experience: October 2015,9-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,LSU Family Weekend,Tiger Stadium is magical! I got to see my daughter perform there with the Tiger Band! It was Awesome!
7969,Date of experience: October 2015,6-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Loved the new suites,We were guests of someone with a suite. The suite was very nice and the food was excellent.   They also have food set up as you come off of the elevator which is for everyone in all the suites.
7970,Date of experience: October 2015,5-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Callin Baton Rouge!!!!,"Unbelievable if you are a sports fan, this is a must see,  We were very lucky to have first row seats, so had a great experience.  Make sure to get there early and take in all the traditions.  If you know someone that has a tailgate spot, become their best friend!!!"
7971,Date of experience: October 2015,5-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Tailgating with the LSMSA Alumni,"First, tailgating at LSU is an experience in itself!  We had a great time then it was time to head to TIGER Stadium.  I love LSU campus and walking the campus again was a treat. I was a bit disappointed to realize that I could have brought my LSU purse or backsak into the stadium.  Now, make sure you have money if you plan to eat or drink because the food around and inside the stadium is very pricey.  A 20oz soda cost $4.50.  Hot dog $3.50.  You get it.  Nevertheless, you will be entertained throughout the game and there will not be a dull moment!  GEAUX TIGERS!!!  (Oh, and yes we won the game!)"
7972,Date of experience: October 2015,4-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Best first game experience!!,"The school pride and spirit is absolutely phenomenal. I've never experienced anything like it in my life. My husband is an LSU grad but we live in Dallas, TX so it's not everyday we can make it to a game but boy was this trip way overdue!! We sat in club 308 and it was terrific. Amazing seats, amazing food and just as great people. Can't wait to come back!!"
7973,Date of experience: October 2015,4-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Always a great time!,"Clean bathrooms, good Cajun food options! I Love Tiger Stadium! It is too bad they tore down the old concession stands! They should have been left! Great history was lost with the tear down of such iconic buildings. Sad"
7974,Date of experience: October 2015,4-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,3,Old Stadium,"My grandson and I went to our first LSU game at this stadium. I bought the best tickets I could find online, on the 50 yard line and in row one. What a mistake!!  The first 10 or so rows are terrible for viewing the field since the design of the stadium is such that you cannot see over the players standing  on the side lines. What a terrible design!!!!!!  We finally found two empty seats higher up and sat there to see the game. Also, the  stadium restrooms are  old, dirty, too small and a poor experienceI will not go to another game here -- watch it on TV instead."
7975,Date of experience: October 2015,4-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Great college experience,Great way to experience college football fever. Tailgating is a must!  Lots of families and friends get together for good old-fashioned fun.
7976,Date of experience: September 2015,3-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Put this on your bucket list,"The LSU Tiger Stadium is simply amazing, Attending a game here is almost like a religious experience, when the band play the school's anthem chills go down your spine. The school has a state of the art scoreboard,the field is spectacular  and they have added extra cell towers so you are always connected. If you are lucky enough to be in the box area, then OMG; its better than a 4 star hotel.Win or Lose..You leave Tiger Stadium in a better place than when you enter."
7977,Date of experience: November 2014,1-Oct-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,They don't call it Death Valley for nothing!!,"If you're a neutral, or unbiased football fan, attend their game at Deat Valley and you'll get goosebumps, walking away looking forward to the next game as a true Tiger fan. From the entrance of the marching band to the team spirit of the fans, we see why this is one of the most hated teams by nearby rival teams/fans. When you're the best, you're gonna have haters! Comes with the territory.Parking is a bit of a hassle, so show up early. With tickets in hand, it's easy to find your gate entrance, then a fairly short walk to your seat. Extremely clean and efficient.We're Tiger fans now. We've gone to 3 games in 2 years and love the fans spirit and passion that we've seen nowhere else.If you're for the opposing team, or wearing their colors, then sorry, all bets are off,. You're in trouble and can expect to get harrassed. They don't call it Death Valley for nothing!!"
7978,Date of experience: October 2014,30-Sep-15,SEC,Louisiana,4,Good experience for the events attended,Been there for football games and BCSF.  Good experience on both counts with the exception of the heat for BCSF.
7979,Date of experience: October 2014,28-Sep-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Best college football stadium!,"A huge stadium full of passionate and LOUD fans are why LSU's Death Valley is feared by opposing teams. Incredible tailgating outside (sometimes for days before the game). Parking is difficult because the stadium holds 100k people, plus the tailgating crowds who don't have tickets to the game."
7980,Date of experience: September 2015,28-Sep-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,My favorite place,"Tiger Stadium, home to the LSU Tigers, is my favorite place to be in the world.  It just doesn't get any better than that."

7982,Date of experience: September 2015,27-Sep-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,LSU v. Auburn 2015,"Electrifying! Exhilarating experience! Louisiana Loves their Bengal Geuax Tigers!Everywhere you looked you could see, hear and feel the excitement and this doesn't even fully describe it....We participated in game day actvugies around campus and even watched the ""Tiger Walk"" with Les Miles and the LSU football players.Great access to the sidelines perimeter of the field."
7983,Date of experience: September 2015,21-Sep-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Great place,"This is a great stadium with plenty of seats. This place is well maintained with plenty of information about the history of LSU, not to mention a place to watch a good football game. I would recommend this to anyone who loves history and football. Tiger stadium is a good place for friends, family, and kids all ages."
7984,Date of experience: September 2015,20-Sep-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,There cannot be a better game day experience than Death Valley,"Whether you are a visitor, student, or LSU alumni, Tiger Stadium is one of the loudest, funniest, most exciting game day experiences you could hope for. From the pregame band show in the activities center to the traditional visit to Mike the Tiger's cage, Louisianians know how to have fun and how to make people feel welcome."
7985,Date of experience: September 2015,19-Sep-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Awesome and impressive,"We visited during the LSU/Auburn game Sept 2015. The stadium is massive, contemporary, and impressive."
7986,Date of experience: September 2015,18-Sep-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Geaux tigers,What can you say greatest place in the world on Saturday night or day. Tiger fans are the best around. No band anywhere can beat the Golden Band From Tigerland when they start the pregame.
7987,Date of experience: September 2015,17-Sep-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Saturday night in Tiger Stadium.....A real experience,You cannot grown up in Louisiana without visiting Tiger Stadium to attend an LSU football game.  The sound is deafening and the excitement is incredible.  I know you can take tours outside of gamedays but not sure of those details
7988,Date of experience: September 2015,16-Sep-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Awesome,Going to a football game in this stadium is a FUN and exciting experience. The students get into the game and the fans are loudy rowdy
7989,Date of experience: October 2014,15-Sep-15,SEC,Louisiana,4,Death Valley is For Real!,"Great college football atmosphere! Very loud with over 100,000 people for a night game. We had great seats reserved for the visiting school. However, we were crammed in so tight we could hardly move. It is one of the truly unique sports venues in the US. Underbelly of the stadium is dark and dirty, however the food was excellent. Local cuisine like gumbo and Jambalaya was very good. Parking for visitors is difficult to find. Long walk to the stadium. Before the game, traffic is a mess. After the game, not so bad - but then we are talking about moving 100,000 people in and out of venue.Good hospitality along with some mild trash talk, but hey, it's SEC football!  High energy. A quality experience. Must be on the bucket list of every college football fan."
7990,Date of experience: September 2015,13-Sep-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,One of the Best Places on Earth!,"I've been an LSU fan all my life and finally got to attend a home game.  Yes,  I'm on cloud 9!  And I used to think I was a crazed fan.  Well here, I was with the others. LOL"
7991,Date of experience: September 2015,13-Sep-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Geaux Tigers,Been going to LSU football games all my life since a child will never forget it it's like no other place. Football heaven! Stadium  has changed for the better by adding on & up dating it!
7992,Date of experience: September 2015,11-Sep-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Awesome,You can just feel the excitement in the air when you enter the stadium!!The seats were awesome and we had no trouble getting to the concession stand. I could see the excitement in my sons eyes and I'm sure he saw the same in mine. I like the way the outside lights change purple and gold with the beat to the music that's being played.

7994,Date of experience: September 2015,9-Sep-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Best football environment in the country!,"I've been to lots of college games--mostly SEC.  Yes, Alabama, Ole Miss, Georgia, others--all great evironments.  LSU ranks at the top for me, though. There's great tailgating in the Grove in Oxford, but it's a relatively small space.  Tailgating for LSU spans MILES.  Every green space on campus is taken--food and drink for the asking (yes, even for opposing fans, who aren't treated as badly as the rep says.  Just avoid drunk frat boys!).  The game itself?  LOUD, great athletes, great tradition."
7995,Date of experience: October 2014,3-Sep-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Geaux Tigers!!!,Most fun and exciting place to be....sends chills down you spine! Best football venue ever!!!!  Geaux Tigers!!!
7997,Date of experience: November 2014,2-Sep-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Loud and Proud!,The Greatest NCAA Football Venue!  Bring your earplugs...it gets pretty loud.  No better  place to watch SEC play.
7998,Date of experience: September 2015,1-Sep-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,No place like it,The best stadium for college football. Lots of variety for food. Really there is no bad seat in the stadium with all of the new jumbo screens. Be prepared to stand for most of not all of the game--it's just tradition.  If you sit anywhere near the student section be prepared for some inappropriate words and actions.
7999,Date of experience: November 2014,1-Sep-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,It's Gotten Better,No place like it on Saturday Night during football season.  The bathrooms are in need of an update.  Parking is always an issue and the contraflow after the game can be confusing.  Be sure to read up on the direction of flow so you won't get lost.
8000,Date of experience: November 2014,29-Aug-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,One of your football stadium must experiences,"If you are college football fan this must be on your list of stadiums to be at. That nothing like tiger stadium at night..... However you must go early to experience true Louisiana tailgating. They are the most friendly people you will find,and they don't mind their food and their football stories."
8001,Date of experience: November 2014,28-Aug-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,...(speaks for itself)...,This is silly to review Tiger Stadium...modern day Coliseum... where opponents dreams perish more often than not.

Which happened to need some assistance to help with scenes and props. I was given the opportunity to shuttle a bus full of actors / actresses to and from shooting engagements. It was quite exciting to see how it was all actually done. The catering service for the staff was truly excellent. After waiting a couple of years, I found the movie to be called ""Glory Road"". 2003 - premiered 2006."
8005,Date of experience: October 2014,18-Aug-15,SEC,Louisiana,1,Not Nice,"The Stadium is nice. The atmosphere not so much. Have been at least 3 times here for games, have been treated rudely every time. Not very friendly or helpful. Will not go back for another game"
8006,Date of experience: November 2014,16-Aug-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Great Fall Fun!,IF you are a fan of college football than Death Valley is a MUST on your buck list. The environment is amazing no matter which team you are cheering for. We love to tailgate with our boys!

8008,Date of experience: August 2015,14-Aug-15,SEC,Louisiana,4,Gigantic,Place is huge. There's a tiger and gift shop that is right outside the entrance as well. If you happen to be on campus it is worth the drive-by.

8011,Date of experience: December 2014,12-Aug-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Sport Fans have to make a Pilgrimage to Death Valley.,"Their is only one Death Valley. The crowds at an LSU game can create an a fearsome atmosphere. The stadium now holds over 90,000 fans for a football game and more for concerts."

8019,Date of experience: September 2014,3-Aug-15,SEC,Louisiana,3,It's Deaf Valley not Death Valley,"I've been to 5 or 6 games here over the past 3 years.  I always heard about how loud the crowd was and rowdy outside the stadium.  My first visit was to a game vs Middle Tennessee State and it was like going to Disney World.  Families with their toddlers being pulled along in wagons and older people tailgating around the stadium grounds...scary!!  I understand it was Mid Tenn State, but I didn't see much difference vs Florida, Auburn, Idaho.  Don't get me wrong, the games are fun but not the overwhelming experience I had been told about.  And I still think it's funny that the fans call the stadium Death Valley - read a little history and you'll find that the nickname was Deaf Valley due to the ""loud crowds""."
8021,Date of experience: November 2014,29-Jul-15,SEC,Louisiana,4,My First Time,"I was in Tiger Stadium for the first time when I went to the Alabama-LSU game last year.  The stadium is HUGE!  To say we were seated in the nose bleed section is an understatement!!!  For once, I REALLY needed the jumbotron to be able to see what was happening on the field."
8022,Date of experience: October 2014,27-Jul-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,"GREAT Stadium,good seats,great place to go and Mike the Tiger is right around the corner.","You must see this place .If you can get a ticket to anything you will like the place.If you see a football game you will  LOVE it,and remember the occasions."
8023,Date of experience: September 2014,27-Jul-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Best!!,"Several magazines/services site Death Valley as the BEST place, especially for nite games.  I've even spent a few nights in Stadium East Dorm, they've since closed the dorm part.   Come early, we've tailgated in front of the union, our ""tailgate"" didn't have the vehicle, but we have everything else."
8025,Date of experience: October 2014,21-Jul-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,It's Saturday night at the Death Valley!,"If you're ever in Baton Rouge and there is an LSU Tiger game, go see it! It is an experience of a lifetime - the atmosphere lead by the chorus belted out by 96,000 spectators, the players, the game, cheerleaders, the band, golden girls and even Mike the Tiger may make an experience."
8027,Date of experience: October 2014,19-Jul-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Meet interesting people and watch football with them!,"The parking lot alone is one of the largest outdoor cocktail parties on Earth any give Friday to Saturday night around 2 am or later.  The stadium has just been expanded, and tickets to the games are very hard to get, but most of the happy cocktailers in the lot have huge TVs to compliment the many satellite dishes on all the motorhomes (season parking I've heard is around 10K) and if you are in purple and gold and make friends fast which can be done by offering a drink or a beer from your wheeled cooler, you can score a seat on your cooler and watch the game on their big screen high def TV set up in the ""patio"" area of the motorhome.  By the way, the sea of abandoned coolers after games is amazing.  Need a cooler?  LSU early Sunday morning has lots of them!  If you don't have a 100K Winnie and a 10K annual parking space, the next best thing is a big wheeled cooler stocked with tasty edibles to share, ditto beer and if you have a nice bottle of single malt scotch, you will get a seat on your cooler, you'll be offered food since you shared your tasty edibles and you could possibly make new friends that will invite you to go to another game IN the big motorhome.  The better your shared cooler contents are, the more likely this is to happen.  Wearing LSU garb is a huge plus by the way and being a personable guest who can hold their liquor and behave appropriately, you will make a lot of points.  We Southern folks are personable LOL"
8028,Date of experience: September 2014,17-Jul-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Love them Tigers baby!,"If there's only one game you ever go to in your life it's got to be at Tiger Stadium! There's nothing quite like the sound when your team is winning and the crowd goes nuts. You can't help but get wrapped up in it. The fans are awesome, the grounds around are great, and traffic is terrible but worth it. Avoid the traffic and just go to Walk-Ons after the game."
8029,Date of experience: October 2014,17-Jul-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Geaux Tigers!,"Great place to experience an SEC football game. Tickets are cheap if you're a student, not so much for parents. Don't bother with parents' weekend; go for a better game like Alabama or Auburn. Walk through the parade grounds before the game so you can see how your son or daughter spends their football game days! Concessions are good and affordable. Excitement is unbeatable. If LSU beats a tough team, look out - the field is packed, the goal posts might come down!"
8030,Date of experience: October 2014,16-Jul-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Death Valley,Tiger stadium is also known as Death Valley.  The most fun place to be on a Saturday night during football season.  They also have the best tailgates going on before and after the games.

However, regardless, you should see a game here.  Saturday night games are everything you've heard about, and the tailgating is off the charts crazy.  Not as much fun if you are in visitor gear however, because all you will hear is ""Tiger Bait""!"
8034,Date of experience: October 2014,10-Jul-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Saturday Night in Tiger Stadium!,"How can you go wrong at Tiger Stadium, home of the LSU Fighting Tigers Football!  If you are in the upper decks, take the elevator up.  The walkway down is great for leaving, with lots of room to accommodate the large crowds.  The concession stands can get a bit pricy, but that's part of the experience in watching the Tigers beat up on any team willing to stumble into Tiger Stadium on a Saturday Night"
8035,Date of experience: September 2014,9-Jul-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Go Tigers!,"The atmosphere is electric. The fans are dedicated to their teams.

Truly one of my favorite places !!"
8048,Date of experience: September 2014,26-Jun-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,GEAUX Tigers!,There is nothing like attending a tailgate and game at Tiger Stadium.  The feeling is electric when close to one hundred thousand fans pile into the stadium.

What a great design! Seats are comfortable, big screens are useful to see the small details during a play, and atmosphere is SECOND TO NONE!! Concessions are good and workers are friendly.  Lines to seats move along quickly and escalators are so helpful! Stadium is beautiful from the outside as well.  Proud that Tiger Stadium is our state! Go Tiger's!!"

8056,Date of experience: November 2014,3-Jun-15,SEC,Louisiana,3,LSU Tiger Stadium,"This is not a friendly stadium if you wear a Gators shirt. But the place is historic.

8066,Date of experience: August 2014,22-May-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Saturday night games in Death Valley are practically a religious experience!,"There is nothing like seeing the Tigers play a sold out game in Death Valley on a Saturday night.  It's an electric experience!Born and raised in Baton Rouge, I've lived and breathed Tiger football for as long as I can remember.  I can't even begin to tell you the excitement that builds as you begin entering Tiger Stadium for a football game.  Rain or shine, fans will show up to support their Tigers.  Our entire culture is built around Saturday nights at Death Valley.  If you live in BR and you're not wearing your purple & gold on Saturday for game day, something is wrong with you.And have a mentioned the tailgating?  There are no other fans that tailgate like LSU fans do.  Tailgating for a game on Saturday begins well before sunrise, sometimes even the night before.  Many fans, including myself, go out and tailgate all day on campus and don't even go to the game.  It's just exciting to be there!There's always a little pep in my step as LSU football season nears.  It's the time of year that I look forward to most.  You can't truly understand it until you've experienced it first hand.  It's intense!  Don't ever pass up the opportunity to experience of going to a football game in Tiger Stadium.  It's truly a magical experience!  Best. Stadium. Ever."
8068,Date of experience: November 2014,20-May-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,"It's Tiger Stadium, what else needs to be said","Maybe the restrooms are Spartan and concessions are the worst food for 200 miles in any direction but then you don't go to the Efiel Tower for its Sreet food or restrooms.  This is the home of controlled insanity at its finest.  Enjoy a day outside the Stadium by felling free to empose  on the hospitality of the locals.  You and your loyality will be welcome as long as you don't feel the need to act like a behind. accept a ""Tiger Bate"" and give a ""your cheer"" and all wifi be fine.   Also give an hour or so after a game for tempers to mellow tbefore you engage in any meaningful conversation."
8070,Date of experience: September 2014,19-May-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Nothing like a Saturday night in Death Valley!,"The absolute best venue to watch college football.  At the tailgate parties, you'll find everything imaginable on the grills, seasoned to perfection!  Although there can be a little taunting of the opposing teams by us Tiger fans, we ultimately go overboard to make everyone feel welcome.  You'll have no difficulty finding fans ready to feed you and offer you a drink.  Inside the stadium, it's LOUD with very passionate fans rooting on their team.  It's magical and electric!"
8071,Date of experience: September 2014,13-May-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Best Stadium ever!,"Loudest stadium ever. Best Fans, and Best Tailgate parties! I live in Baton Rouge and usually go to several games a year. We love our tigers and it shows!"

8079,Date of experience: September 2014,22-Apr-15,SEC,Louisiana,3,Great tailgating. That's the upside.....,"Outside the stadium things are fun, one huge party, but once you get in the stadium be prepared to wait a long time for food and bathrooms at times. Also if the Tigers  are losing or in a close game, cover your kids ears cause there are plenty of LSU fans that will curse at the top of their lungs about play calling, penalties, etc the whole game. I will go back for the tailgating but likely not go back in the stadium. Oh, parking is not great unless you get there real early!"
8080,Date of experience: October 2014,19-Apr-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Best place to be on a Saturday night,My Family and I love this place.

8081,Date of experience: October 2014,17-Apr-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Football Games,Great atmosphere night games are the greatest atmosphere in college football. Tailgating is #1 in the nation.  the best free party   You can float from one tailgate to the next.  Best southern hospitality. Endless food and adult beverages. The only negative is the traffic after the game.
8082,Date of experience: November 2014,15-Apr-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Legendary Tiger Stadium where the best experience on Saturday night can be had!,"For well over 40 years I have enjoyed myself in LSU Tiger Stadium.  First attending games there as a youth, then living in dorms there as a student, then attending games there as an adult, including the Earthquake Game in which the LSU fans made such such noise as to mimic an earthquake on seismographs located across campus.  The LSU campus is beautiful, one of the most picturesque in all of universities.  Across from this legendary stadium which was recently expanded to hold 102,000 plus fans, is the habitat for MIke the Tiger, LSU's live Bengal tiger mascot.  That is quite an experience being up close and personal with a live Bengal tiger.One of the best experiences for LSU fans and fans of other teams.  Numerous fans of opposing teams, even fans of renown, have said the experience they had at LSU Tiger Stadium Saturday night was the best they ever had."
8083,Date of experience: October 2014,10-Apr-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,There's Nothing Like Saturday Night In Tiger Stadium,Every game at Death Valley is an amazing experience.  The crowd is always into the game.  The pre-game atmosphere is also something to experience.  It's hard to put into words the feeling you have while watching a game there.  There truely is nothing like a Saturday night in Tiger Stadium!
8085,Date of experience: November 2014,9-Apr-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Nothing like Saturday Night at Tiger Stadium!!!,"It is the place to be on a Saturday night.  I don't care which team you cheer for, you will be welcomed with food, drinks, and all kinds of ""camaraderie.""  C'mon down, have yourself a great time!"
8086,Date of experience: September 2014,7-Apr-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Wonderful Stadium with Awesome Fans,"This was our first experience with an LSU game, and it was unforgettable.  There were more fans outside the stadium than inside......and this wasn't even an SEC game!  :)  Just an amazing outpouring of support from the community for them overall.  We even saw a Great Dane painted like a tiger!  The stadium was rather nice, with great views from the seats.  The Band and Dancers were there, and they put on a great show.  The intro video helped clear up a lot about the LSU iconography that you see EVERYWHERE in Louisiana.  Little did I know that the thing that looked like a disembodied eye was the ""Eye of the Tiger"".  I had no clue.  LOL  :-D  And they are definitely proud that Garth Brooks made his classic ""Callin' Baton Rouge"" song.  The montage that they did to it was amazing.  We had the standard Season Ticket Holder seats, which included little attachable cushions, and it is definitely worth it to have them.  The concessions are easy to get to, and you can pick from a couple types of food.  I can't wait until they open up the normal stadium to alcoholic beverages, like they allow in the upper decks already due to a bureaucratic snafu and distinction.  It would only make a great experience better.  :)"
8089,Date of experience: October 2014,18-Mar-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Game day,"LSU our first ever football game, what an awesome atmosphere, 100,0000+ fans cheering on their team a sea of purple and gold. Going tailgating was an experience. Thoroughly enjoyable day out and to top it off LSU won! GO TIGERS"
8091,Date of experience: November 2014,17-Mar-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Home of the Tigers,"Not a lot to say that you probably don't know.  Home of the LSU Tiger football team in a state where football is a religion. Otherwise known as Death Valley, this venue explodes like no other venue I have ever seen on game day.  Often voted the best place on earth for tailgating this venue will not disappoint. The party starts early in the morning and goes all day.  Everyone should attend an SEC game at least once, and this is the place."
8097,Date of experience: October 2014,18-Feb-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Tiger Stadium is a must for all football fans!,Tiger Stadium is an incredible experience for any football fan. Come prepared and definitely tailgate before the game.
8098,Date of experience: September 2014,18-Feb-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Best place on earth to watch a college football game.,I'm a little biased as LSU alumna but there's no place like Death Valley. From the tailgating and the good old southern cooking to the southern hospitality from absolute strangers...it's a unique experience. It's a place that's gotten so loud that it was recorded on a nearby seismograph! Now that's a place to be on a Saturday night.
8099,Date of experience: October 2014,18-Feb-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Nothing like Tiger Stadium on a fall Saturday night,"Words cannot do it justice.  If you have never experienced an LSU game at Death Valley, you just aren't living!"
8100,Date of experience: September 2014,18-Feb-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,Forever LSU,No place like it on a fall Saturday night.   Parking can be a problem. Be prepared to walk or pay a premium.  Mike the Tiger's habitat is right outside the stadium.  He is beautiful.
8101,Date of experience: January 2015,18-Feb-15,SEC,Louisiana,4,One of the larger stadiums in the country,"By the time they get done seating capacity will exceed 100,000.  Amazing that no pro stadium can match the seating capacity of the larger universities.  If you are out for exercise try running the stairs if the stadium is open for this.  Local Boy Scout troops often prep for Philmont and other high adventure treks by running and walking the stairs with full back packs.  As huge and magnificent as it is, the thrill of the crowd is missing if you are not there on game day.  But for a close up of a modern wonder Tiger Stadium is hard to beat."
8102,Date of experience: October 2014,18-Feb-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,An experience you will never forget!,"Saturday night in Tiger Stadium is something that ALL LSU fans should experience at least once in their lifetime.  The atmosphere is electric.  As you sit, stand, scream, yell and cheer, your blood will begin to change colors and you will find that you begin to bleed purple and gold!"
8103,Date of experience: September 2014,18-Feb-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,The BEST stadium in college football!,A game in Tiger Stadium will not soon be forgotten!  It's fun and electrifying!  There's nothing like Saturday night in Death Valley!

8107,Date of experience: December 2014,6-Jan-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,SEC FOOTBALL,I am a huge College Football fan so on a recent visit to Baton Rouge to visit with friends I just had to stop here to see Tiger Stadium. I couldn't get over how big it was. Next Fall I am going back for a game on a Saturday night. A Saturday night in Tiger Stadium vs. an SEC opponent is what College Football is all about. GEAUX TIGERS
8108,Date of experience: September 2014,6-Jan-15,SEC,Louisiana,5,My son's very first LSU game!,He was almost four when we took him to his first game as we didn't want to take him too early of an age. He absolutely loved it. I was one proud dad on that day!!
8109,Date of experience: December 2014,21-Dec-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Must see Mike!,"We stopped at the LSU stadium to get out and stretch our legs. We saw Mike the Bengal Tiger in his habitat. We took lots of pictures of him walking and strutting his stuff. There is a large area for him to swim, climb and live. Next to him is the LSU Sports Shop. We were told some of the proceeds from the shop go to Mike for his care and well-being. The vet students at LSU take care of his medical needs. Of course, we bought LSU shirts even though we live in Penn State country."
8110,Date of experience: October 2014,16-Dec-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Geaux Tigers!,"I'm an LSU alum so Tiger Stadium is a special place.  When I moved from LSU to work at Notre Dame -- a football school if ever there was one -- my colleagues couldn't understand why I was underwhelmed on Game Day.  I've since come to understand that tailgating at LSU is a world unto itself.  'Bama may beat us on the field but nobody does pre-game as well as LSU, period."
8111,Date of experience: October 2014,5-Dec-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,There's nothing like being in Tiger Stadium!,No matter how old I get  (and I'm a grandmother) I still get chills whenever the Tiger Band comes into the stadium and the  LSU football team runs onto the field.  It's a unique experience!
8113,Date of experience: October 2014,2-Dec-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Enjoy the feel of a stadium rock!,"This is one of the best tail-gating stadiums in the USA.  Get tickets to a hot SEC game and feel the stadium shake.  LSUfans are the greatest pre-game folks.  Be nice and they will give you free drinks and great Cajun food.  But if your team wins,,,beware.   Just a great place to people watch."
8114,Date of experience: October 2014,2-Dec-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Awesome game!!!,"We went to the LSU/Ole Miss game. I am a TN fan, but since I live in Baton Rouge, I enjoy watching LSU.  Luckily, we were able to sit in the new club level. It was such a great experience. The free food was tasty. The crowd was electric. Enjoyed this game very much. I would definitely recommend attending a game at Tiger Stadium (especially if it is an SEC game)."
8115,Date of experience: November 2014,2-Dec-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,LSU Football game,If you are in Baton Rouge and there is a football game at Tiger Statium known as Death Valley then try to get tickets anywhere in the statium will  do.  It is a wonderful experience and certainly thrilling when the Tigers win.  Geaux Tigers.  BUT tickets are not easy to get!!!!!
8116,Date of experience: November 2014,17-Nov-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Best College Environment,"Tiger Stadium hasn't earned such national recognition for nothing.  From the tons of food during the tailgating to the electric environment in the stadium, you will have a great college football experience second to none!"
8117,Date of experience: November 2014,17-Nov-14,SEC,Louisiana,4,Great stadium/horrible traffic,The stadium has a great atmosphere. We had club level seats and they were great! The traffic leaving the games is horrible. It does not move!!! It took us almost 2 hours to go 1 mile...
8118,Date of experience: November 2014,12-Nov-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Saturday Night against SEC team,"Nothing like a Saturday Night when playing a significant opponent.  Tailgating is great.  Competition with lackluster teams does not excite the crowd, with many leaving early in the game."
8119,Date of experience: November 2014,12-Nov-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Tiger Stadium rocks on Saturday nights!,All visitors to the area should try to attend at least one LSU home game on a Saturday night.  It doesn't really matter who they play.  The crowd is electric and it's THE PLACE TO BE every Saturday night in Baton Rouge during college football season!
8120,Date of experience: October 2014,12-Nov-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Wonderful View,"Love the game. Good food , Great people, had a blast great seats, lots of fun and entertaining going on."

Oh What a Night the fans ,the stadium rocked on this Louisiana Night loved everything but the outcome Alabama 20 LSU 13 . Unfortunately the Tiger's in Death Valley could not pull off the upset"
8122,Date of experience: October 2014,11-Nov-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Can't miss this if you are a college football fan,"The energy in this stadium is contagious, no matter which team you are pulling for.  No matter where you sit, there is a great view of the field.  If you've never been to a game in Death Valley, be prepared for a very loud and exciting time."
8123,Date of experience: November 2014,9-Nov-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,"Awesome, simply the best stadium in the NCAA","My wife and I went to the disappointing LSU v. Alabama overtime game (we are originally from Southern Louisiana and we are LSU fans).  We had sideline tickets and felt the thrill of tiger stadium, it may be getting old on the inside, but it is a very special place - so much energy, so much passion, and so darn loud!"
8124,Date of experience: October 2014,6-Nov-14,SEC,Louisiana,4,Beat Down In Baton Rouge,There is no place like Tiger Stadium at night for a NCAA football game. Although the Ole Miss Rebels were unsuccessful in the ballgame we enjoyed the atmosphere and time that we had. Meet allot of nice LSU fans as we were sitting on the LSU home side. My one recommendation for a trip to Death Valley would be to carry a set of ear plugs! Tiger Stadium is by far the loudest stadium and fan base in the country...
8125,Date of experience: October 2014,5-Nov-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Sensory overload!!,"For the hardcore football fanatic, the casual fan, people watcher, partyer or some combination of the above, this is a place you gotta see on a call Saturday game night. Words don't do it justice. You've gotta go!"

8128,Date of experience: October 2014,3-Nov-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Great on a Saturday night,"An amazing way to spend a Saturday night watching the Tigers play some beloved football. And beforehand, visit Mike's tiger enclosure. Pretty incredible to get that close to such a powerful animal."
8129,Date of experience: November 2014,3-Nov-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Every other stadium wants to be Tiger Stadium when it grows up.,"There really is nothing to compare this to. This is like the Coliseum in Rome. The band, the views, the teams, the SEC!"

New addition beautiful the club level is just awesome.  Mostly though, GEAUX TIGERS!!  Parking still rough, traffic rough as well but plenty of time to tailgate."
8131,Date of experience: October 2014,1-Nov-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,LSU Over Ole Miss!,The area has some great restaurants! We ate at TJ Ribbs and Acme Oyster House before the game.  This was a packed weekend but everyone was great except the hotel staff at Super 8!
8133,Date of experience: October 2014,29-Oct-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,No place like Tiger Stadium on Saturday Night,Opponents fear our place.  Ask Ole Miss.  It's load and raucous.  It should be on everyone's bucket list.
8134,Date of experience: October 2014,28-Oct-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Nothing like a trip to Death Valley.,"If you ever are offered the opportunity to visit Death Valley, especially the suites section, don't pass it up. This stadium rocks, and the night we went the Tigers won. All of the food was very good, the suites are spacious. The whole experience was excellent."
8135,Date of experience: October 2014,27-Oct-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,"Great stadium, it is huge","It is one biggest stadiums in the nation. I visited for the first time, and I was very impressed. I stayed for a LSU-Ole Miss game, and it was a great experience. If you like college football, this is the place to visit."
8136,Date of experience: October 2014,26-Oct-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Geaux Tigers!,You don't have a clue what college football is about until you've watched LSU play in Death Valley on a Saturday night.  Period.  No discussion.  Really.
8137,Date of experience: October 2014,23-Oct-14,SEC,Louisiana,4,Not Handicap Friendly,"CON: My husband is handicap and we were not aware the Stadium is not equipped for the disabled.   There are no elevators nor escalators to get you to all seat sections.  They have ramps to walk up but no golf carts to take a person that can't walk up their seat levels.PRO:  Lots of Spirit, easy access to concessions and restrooms."
8138,Date of experience: October 2014,23-Oct-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Great atmosphere for SEC Football.,Very easy check-in and prices were great at the concession stand. We were able to go down to the bottom of the stadium to take pictures of players and mascot.

Lots of fun!Family friendly fun to experience the hoopla of the ore game & game!Con session area is a bit dark and dreary looking but having over 102,000 people traipsing thru would be a bit difficult to keep up with"
8142,Date of experience: October 2014,11-Oct-14,SEC,Louisiana,4,HUGE,We didn't go inside but good grief - that thing is HUGE! It looks like a Roman Colosseum! Not a football fan but this has got to be one of the biggest college stadiums in the world.
8143,Date of experience: September 2014,10-Oct-14,SEC,Louisiana,3,Production managed by adolescents!,"Color, pageantry Tiger band. Dislikes: Horribly loud PA system playing inappropriate music at inappropriate times. Ad panels so bright and distracting that it is difficult following on-field action."
8144,Date of experience: September 2014,1-Oct-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Amazing!,Have to arrive early to enjoy the entire experience! Don't miss the golden band from tiger land and the players marching down victory hill!!
8145,Date of experience: October 2013,29-Sep-14,SEC,Louisiana,2,Over priced and sucks!,"Not even good food the the suites. Tailgate and eat before you go in. Tiger water $6.00. Buggers, hot dogs, better at any tailgate."
8146,Date of experience: September 2014,29-Sep-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Nothing like it,Tiger Stadium on a none game day is still an impressive stadium however on a Saturday with a home night game Amazing. There simply is nothing comparable.
8147,Date of experience: September 2014,29-Sep-14,SEC,Louisiana,4,Tiger Fans Living on Reputation,"I've been to dozens of games at Tiger Stadium over the years.I still consider it THE ""must see"" setting for college football.  But too many Tiger fans are spoiled, lazy, fair weather folks.Too many people left the Mississippi State game when the home team trailed, too many people came late and left early when the Bayou Bengals crushed New Mexico State.  With LSU holding a big lead on a beautiful September night, about half the crowd left at halftime, even before enjoying the great band and lovely Golden Girls.  When you only get six or seven chances per year to soak up a one-of-a-kind experience, you'd think more true fans would appreciate it.  Geaux Tigers."
8148,Date of experience: September 2014,29-Sep-14,SEC,Louisiana,4,A Feeling Like No Other,"What can I say, being there when the band goes in, chanting with 100,000 of your closest friends - an experience like no other."
8149,Date of experience: September 2014,29-Sep-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Good even in nosebleed,"This was my first college game ever, and even though we were almost at the top (one row more we would have been), the views are incredible, the players did not look like ants, and the big screen were great to look at for replays."
8151,Date of experience: September 2014,25-Sep-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,"Awesome place, and awesome tailgating!","The school and surrounding grounds were really awesome, and the people there were very gracious to fans of the opposing team, like me."
8152,Date of experience: September 2014,17-Sep-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Death Valley,"No matter your affiliation or lack there of to Louisiana State University, you need to make a point to visit Death Valley for a LSU Football game, if you have the opportunity. It's a place where even non-sports fans can appreciate the lightening in the air. People say they have been to college football games before; however, there will not be one as memorable or electrifying as the night you spent in LSU Tiger Stadium."
8153,Date of experience: September 2014,7-Sep-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Let the Good Times Roll,A great experience for football fans.  The fans are loyal & devoted.  The whole Baton Rouge community turns it's attention to LSU during football season.  The tailgating is a social event for all families and friends.  Come join the LSU family at Tiger Stadium.
8154,Date of experience: October 2013,2-Sep-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,It's Saturday Night in Tiger Stadium!,"There's no place like Tiger Stadium for a football game.  Actually, the fun starts earlier in the day with tailgating.  You can wander for hours and make lots of new friends and eat a lot of good food. Everybody is your friend when you're tailgating.   But keep track of the time.  You really don't want to miss theTiger band's opening four notes during the pregame show.   It's the very best!!  Football, friends and good food.  That's Baton Rouge on a Saturday night during football season.  Get a ticket!"
8155,Date of experience: November 2013,2-Sep-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,A Mecca of college football,"Tiger Stadium is an awesome experience on a Saturday night for any football fan!  It is one of the greatest venues in all of college football and has one of the noisiest fan bases! The tailgates are welcoming to all, especially opponents.  Visitors might take a bit of good-natured ""abuse"", but they'll be well fed!  Come early to watch the Golden Band from Tigerland march to the stadium, and see an amazing pre-game show, as well as half-time!  Watch for Mike, LSU's Bengal  tiger to take his trip around the field and intimidate the opponents.  Overall, an experience not to be missed!"
8156,Date of experience: November 2013,2-Sep-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,College football in the SEC,"I love college football, and Tiger Stadium is always a special place. If you get there early for a 7 PM kickoff, you can usually grab some tickets. To get to the stadium, you may also want to check into shuttle buses from hotels or from downtown as parking is hard to come by near campus. Get there early for tailgating, too. If you're nice we'll generally feed you when you come by."
8157,Date of experience: November 2013,2-Sep-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Best college venue!,It was an awesome stadium already but just recently added/expanded to the stadium!  Get ready for another registration on the rector scale!!

8159,Date of experience: October 2013,20-Aug-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Always a Great Experience,LSU Football in Tiger Stadium is the best.  Very exciting and a lot of fun especially with all of the tailgating going on outside the stadium.
8160,Date of experience: November 2013,19-Aug-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Greatest Stadium in the Country,Where opponent's dreams go to die.  The stadium is a monument to College Football and should be a bucket list item for those that have not been there.  Be sure to show up early and tailgate on campus and get in the stadium early to see the Golden Band from Tiger Land warm up the crowd while Mike the Tiger makes a lap around the stadium.
8161,Date of experience: November 2013,11-Aug-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,no better place on a fall saturday night...,"I love Tiger Stadium, the atmosphere, the arena, the football!  It truly is the greatest place to be on a cool crisp fall night when LSU is playing one of our rival opponents... Florida, Arkansas, Alabama... it is a must-see and a must-do for any and all visitors to Baton Rouge."
8162,Date of experience: October 2013,6-Aug-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Death Valley??,"If you ever have the opportunity to be in Tiger stadium on a Saturday Night.. or day.. by all means avail yourself of this extraordinary experience.   No matter who the LSU opponent is, SEC or smaller, the memories you will take away with you are everlasting.  The structure itself is imposing, oh and cannot wait to see the new addition to the South stadium.  Arrive early for all of the pregame activities on campus (tailgating at its best)(watching the team and band walk down the hill to the stadium ..  what excitement when Mike the Tiger is rolled through the stadium pregame in his cage, cheer leaders on top.  OH MY!  but just wait for the first four notes of the enormous LSU proud band as they begin their march onto the field. ..  YOU can be deafened by the ROAR of the crowd. When the Football team streams into the stadium, the line of capable young men seems endless and all with great enthusiasm.  Of course great anticipation for them and all 92,000 people in attendance, from the starting whistle to the ending play.  OH I for got the halftime shows that get better and better.  These band members are as proud of what they do as the ball players.. and they are excellent. total winners.  just a show NOT to be missed.... hhhmmm however the getting there can be a nightmare.  CATS  the city bus provides buses from downtown Baton rouge locations and hotels to get you to the and from for $10 round trip . definitely a bargain.  avoid  the parking insanity.  Just  GEAUX if you can..         even if you do not have tickets.. always selling outside or just walk around the campus all day.. People will feed you from the amazing food that is available."

With all those degrees, why can't they address this problem?  I know the suites are A/C and that's where the ideas are approved-keep the cats cool/Mike too"
8167,Date of experience: November 2013,12-Jul-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Great college football,"Going to a night game at LSU was on the bucket list. It did not disappoint.

I have been to many other stadiums around the world but no other can match up for comfort ,safety and enthusiasm - from opposing teams as well. Be sure to visit the Tiger Hall of Fame and Mike the Tiger's habitat"
8183,Date of experience: October 2013,14-May-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Must go!,if you have never been to a big time college football game this is the place to go. No other place like it. the party starts Thursday and goes till after the game.
8184,Date of experience: November 2013,28-Apr-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,It Never Rains Here!,"My son (FL) and I (GA) have had a standing trip every year to catch one LSU Tigers game each year.  Yes, as you read, tickets are hard to get sometimes, but I assure you, you will never experience what LSU will gift you with in the stadium......anywhere in the world.  Come in your teams colors (preferably purple and gold) and prepare for good eating, fine drinking, exciting football and a party like none other!"

The roar of the crowd in a big game is so loud you ears will ring. It's an experience like no other stadium."
8191,Date of experience: October 2013,15-Apr-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Classic college football venue,"It is well worth a visit (if you can get tickets), if for no reason other than to watch the Tiger Band pre-game show. It ranks up there with the best like West Point's Michie Stadium and Kyle Field at Texas A&M"
8192,Date of experience: November 2013,15-Apr-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Tiger Stadium is one of the country's top football experiences.,"I will admit that I am biased, but Saturday night in Death Valley is an experience like no other.  If you will be attending a game, you might want to check ahead about parking regulations.  We parked for years near the music building and tailgated under the trees.  I think there may be a $40 per game charge to park there now.  Also, don't plan on driving up at 6:30 for a 7:00 game.  That is the reason tailgating is such a big deal - you have to go early to find a place to park.  There is a hill that leads from the main part of the campus to the stadium called Victory Hill.  You need to get there about an hour or so before the start time so you can see the awesome LSU Tiger Marching Band enter the stadium.  There will be around 90,000 people on either side of the street waiting for the band before they go in.  The band marches in to a slow cadence until they reach the foot of the hill.  When stopped, the band stretches all the way back to the street above the hill.  As all 350 members face to the left and begin to play Hold that Tiger, the crowd erupts in a roar.  As the band gets to the main part of the fight song, they jog all the rest of the way to their gate.  As a newspaper reporter said not long ago, other people have good bands, but the LSU folks are just a little more proud of theirs than other people.  If you are going to a day game or the Bayou Country Superfest, remember that it is HOT.  Don't forget the sunscreen."
8193,Date of experience: September 2013,15-Apr-14,SEC,Louisiana,5,Best College Experience!!!,"LSU is the best college game day experience I have seen!!! And its not even just the game, they way we tailgate is like non other. People show up on Friday just to get set up & start partying. On game day you have 150,000 people out there, everyone is cooking & love to feed anyone. We have some of the most fanatic fans I ever seen. Its going to be VERY loud at the game, we yell loud & proud!!! If you luv college football I would say its a must see!!"

8209,Date of experience: November 2013,25-Nov-13,SEC,Louisiana,5,Where dreams come to die,No place like Tiger Stadium on a Saturday night. The tailgating starts the night before and the party goes well after the game is over.
8210,Date of experience: October 2013,25-Nov-13,SEC,Louisiana,5,Amazing Stadium,"LSU's Tiger Stadium is a world class college venue. There is nothing like attending a football game at LSU. The enthusiasm of LSU fans is unparalleled. The facility is well maintained and there is no bad seat to be had. Before the game,  fans enjoy tailgating throughout the campus. The scene around the stadium is always high energy. The Tiger Band, Golden Girls and Flag Corp march down the hill exciting the crowd even more.  It's an all day affair."
8211,Date of experience: December 2012,25-Nov-13,SEC,Louisiana,4,Tiger Stadium: worth a visit but better with a guide,"For the LSU fan (or any other avid sports fan), Tiger Stadium is certainly worth a visit, but with so much history associated with this facility and so many ""secrets"" hidden within, it is better to have a guide.

8214,Date of experience: October 2013,25-Nov-13,SEC,Louisiana,5,Death Valley is great if you are a Tiger fan or not,Got to be there on a Saturday night for one of the big games. Be sure to go early to be able to see Mike the tiger in his enclosure and definitely walk around to all of the groups of people tailgating. You are sure to get invited to eat some wonderful food. Drink too. Even if you are there with the opposing team. Just be prepared for a little razzing and trash talk.
8215,Date of experience: October 2013,25-Nov-13,SEC,Louisiana,5,Fun and games!,"Be here for The Tiger Walk if you can.

8216,Date of experience: November 2013,25-Nov-13,SEC,Louisiana,5,Death Valley on a Saturday night,"I've been to college football stadium in all four corners of the country to watch different teams.  You can't beat the tailgating leading up to the game and the atmosphere of the fans and the student section.  The crowd noise and the energy are electrifying.  Definitely a place to check out with your friends or family.  If you're a fan of your team, their team, or no team, the tailgaters treat everyone to good food and conversation."

The fans are awesome and let their favorite team know of their support.  We love to intimidate our opponents with our loud noise.  We also love to tailgate all day long before a game.  Cajuns cooking up jambalaya, gumbo, and you'll even find some barbeque and smoked meats.  Lots of good eating!  Lots of fun!!!!  Always a fun time in Tiger Stadium!!!!!"
8220,Date of experience: October 2013,29-Oct-13,SEC,Louisiana,5,Recent trip to Baton Rouge,What can you say about Tiger Stadium on a Saturday night!  Lot of food choices in the stadium but be prepared to pay a high price. Tailgating is the way to go.  Loved it! Geaux Tigers!
8221,Date of experience: October 2013,28-Oct-13,SEC,Louisiana,4,Intimidating stadium when fans show up,"LSU Tiger Stadium definitely lives up to its reputation for being an intimidating stadium for visiting teams.  It definitely was one of the largest football stadiums that I've been to, and they were adding even more seats to increase the already 90,000+ capacity.  However with the large seating capacity also comes with high ticket prices even at the upper levels.  $75 for one ticket in the nose bleed section for a college game is ridiculous.  If you are seated in the upper levels, be prepared to get some exercise climbing a lot of stairs.  It was also hot and humid even in October, so everyone seated in the sun was sweating all game long.  Even though I was at the top, I was near the 50 yard line and had a very good view of the action.  A benefit for being so high was also being able to see the surrounding area outside the stadium as well.  One thing that I would've liked to see for them to improve the experience was to add a better selection of food options.  They had basically what you'd find at a high school game.The biggest issue with the stadium is the parking situation.  You'd think that with a stadium of this size that they'd have an effective traffic control and ample parking.  However unless you start making your way there at least three hours prior to kickoff before a big game, expect to find very few spots and be prepared to miss the kickoff.  By the time I found a lot down by a local football field and made it to my seat, it was only 30 minutes before the game started.  Prices for parking also depends on what lot you choose.  I paid $10, but the lot right next to it charged $20.  The only thing good about where I parked was being able to drive along a side street in the neighborhood after the game, which saved a lot of time not waiting in stop and go traffic heading to the interstate.  Why people were waiting in traffic while only a few of us just a block or two (and in view) was surprising.The atmosphere of the game was good, however didn't match up to the hype that I had heard about during a LSU game.  Given that the game was against two top 25 teams and that the opponent was Florida, I would've expected it to be wild.  However it was quiet for the entire first half.  It didn't even start to get loud until the middle of the third quarter.  It was evident that it does get loud, but strangely didn't for this important game.  One of the local fans stated that LSU fans have a hard time showing up for day games, as you'd have to start drinking beer at 8:30 in the morning.  It gets wild for a night game as the fans have plenty of time to get drunk.  Don't know if this a good thing or not, but would recommend going to a night game if you want to experience the true LSU experience.Overall, the LSU Stadium offers a good venue to watch a top-tier college football game.  I would go back if in the area, but probably would not go out of my way to go there again for a day game.  Also, if you are seated in the upper sections there are a couple of options to enter the stadium.  One entrance has escalators which take you to each of the levels.  However I bypassed it because the line was extremely long and walked up the ramp at the entrance on the other end.  From what I understand, the escalators overheat so they only allow around 10 people to go up at a time before they stop it for a bit to cool off.  If you are handicapped, I would recommend using the elevator located in the middle entrance."

Penn State, Bryant-Denny (been there - great experience), Legion Field (been there - great experience), The Rose Bowl, Neyland Stadium (been there - great experience) among others. This is one of the countries oldest stadiums and one of the earliest with lighting for night games (this is always the best experience). Whether you are home or guest, you will get treated right.

Fans are wild (some have participated in adult beverage)...Come early for the tailgating experience. Fans are friendly, at least until the game starts and usually after game since LSU rarely loses a night game at home."
8250,Date of experience: August 2012,29-Jul-13,SEC,Louisiana,4,Tiger Stadium-Not for the old folks......,"The place to be on any Saturday during football season.Not advisable for anyone over 55.Unless you are in a 'box' or 'club' seating accessibility is somewhat difficult,ramps are at a steep grade along with the stadium stairs. The walk from the parking lots are a real hike. After game traffic is also very difficult.Fans are generally polite but there are some who have no conception of reality(courtesy). During day games or early evening games the Northeast corner of the stadium has extreme direct sunlight.Everyone should have this on their bucket( to-do) list at least once during their lifetime."

8252,Date of experience: October 2012,29-Jul-13,SEC,Louisiana,5,No place like Tiger stadium on a Saturday night!,"LSU's football stadium is one of the biggest and loudest places in college football. It's worth a trip even if you aren't a huge fan of either team. The atmosphere and excitement in the stadium is almost as unique as the myriad choices of food at the tailgating parties outside the stadium. You can have as much fun outside as inside if you don't have a ticket. If you go early and walk around the RV lots, you can pick up tickets for almost any game. If you go to a day game and it is warm, try to get tickets on the southwest to northwest side. The east side can be brutal in afternoon sun for early season games."
8253,Date of experience: September 2012,29-Jul-13,SEC,Louisiana,5,THE BEST!,"There is nothing like SEC football to begin with, but then there is REALLY nothing like a game, especially a night game in Tiger Stadium! There is also no better tailgaiting in the country. We like to share our hospitality, amazing food, and culture. Be prepared to sweat...a lot, as the heat and humidity is abundant well into October. Wear comfortable shoes as tailgaiting takes place over every inch of the university (unlike other SEC venues). It is not unusual to walk 5-10 miles during the course of a day (and we start EARLY in the day)!"

I cannot imagine another arena with more atmosphere and excitement than Tiger Stadium on a Saturday night.  The event staff are very friendly and helpful. Law enforcement officers are in attendance and visibly on duty.

I grew up in LA but sadly dobn't live there now so when I go home each year I always visit the campus and go to a game if I'm lucky. I grew up going to games, to see Mike and just ti enjoy the campus. Don't miss out if you travel to Baton Rouge. Even if no game is being played you'll have a great time and never want to leave!"

The LSU fans are probably the most enthusiastic fans in the nation.  To say the least, they really enjoy the game, which can be seen through their actions and their attire.

Despite what you might have heard elsewhere, the fans are real friendly.  I can not tell you how many times that I have seen a tail gate group welcome perfect strangers from the other team into their tail gate and offer full access to food and drink.  It is a celebration of South Louisiana and as long as you come somewhat open minded and friendly yourself, you will have a great time."

8311,Date of experience: September 2012,1-Oct-12,SEC,Louisiana,5,My Wife's first Trip To Tiger Stadium,We recently traveled down to Baton Rouge for the LSU Towson game and had a great time.   Went by the stadium the night before taking pictures and got several of Mike where he almost seemed to be grinning at us and all there. Everyone was friendly (actually every one!) and we had a great time and the stadium is wonderful
8312,Date of experience: September 2012,1-Oct-12,SEC,Louisiana,5,LSU vs. Towson game,"We won tickets to the game and our seats were in the 688 section which is on the 15 yard line.  The walk up the concrete tower was long.  The seats were metal benches without a back.  We were at the very top row-FF-so it was a good walk back down to the restrooms and concessions.  Many people left at half time and we moved down and over so we were on the 45 yard line--and found empty seats with backs.  I ate a tiger burger from the concession and it was decent.  My husband had cheese nachos and they were not very good.  We generally like to sit close to the 50 yard line, but really the view was pretty decent in 688.  The bad thing about sitting on the visitor's side is that the marching band mostly faces the home side when they are performing.  It did rain slightly during the game, but we stayed and it cleared up quickly.  As always, we love to watch the Tigers play."
8315,Date of experience: October 2011,17-Sep-12,SEC,Louisiana,5,Football,"If you have not been to Death Valley during football season, you must! The LSU tiger fans are real fanatics!

The pre- game activities are a spectacle  within themselves - the "" Golden Band from Tiger  Land"" marching down Victory Hill to the cheers of 20,000 plus fans, their pre- game march, the tradition of playing "" Louisiana Saturday night "" , ""Baton Rouge"" And "" Eye of the Tiger"" over the loud speakers and of course Mike Iv's trip around Tiger Stadium !! Put this on your "" Bucket List "", it's a must see experience !!!!!!!"
8318,Date of experience: September 2012,11-Sep-12,SEC,Louisiana,4,Great big stadium,"Large, loud and the tailgating fans will treat you well, even as an outsider.  Check out the facility for the live tiger mascot on the north side of the stadium.  Worth the trip."
8319,Date of experience: September 2012,10-Sep-12,SEC,Louisiana,4,"Lots of history, good football team..","Just wish my Huskies wouldn't have shown up.  The stadium is worth catching a game in, lots of history, plenty of good seats.  We were in section 424 (between the 5 yard line and end zone on the purple end zone side).  Seats were good, but note that almost all seats are benches, so be sure to bring a seat cushion with a back to it."
8320,Date of experience: November 2011,10-Sep-12,SEC,Louisiana,5,As good an atmosphere as it gets,"Stadium is a bit dated, but it makes up for it in atmosphere.

If you are just a fan of college football this is a stadium you have to see a game at."
8321,Date of experience: September 2012,6-Sep-12,SEC,Louisiana,5,Amazing atmosphere!!,"Being from Australia it was incredible for us to witness the first home game of the Tigers against North Texas. And we heard that this was only a small game in comparison. The pomp, the ceremony, the game, the passion of the fans. Approximately 92,000 people cheering for their team. Wow!! is all we can say. We were so happy to witness something like that."
8322,Date of experience: September 2012,4-Sep-12,SEC,Louisiana,5,The BEST for Saturday night  College Football,"I admit that I graduated from LSU and have been going to games for many years, but this is one of the most exciting places to watch a good college football game in the country.  At many schools, day games are all the rage and tradition.  In Tiger Stadium, the night games are the special ones.  The Tiger Band is incredible.  For the whole experience, see the tail-gating before the game as well as the band march down the hill to the stadium.  For trivia buffs, when you are in Tiger Stadium, look at the field for something unusual that only one or two other colleges in the country do.  Have fun!!!!!"
8323,Date of experience: September 2012,3-Sep-12,SEC,Louisiana,5,Mike's Place,"Mike the Tiger lives in the shadow of LSU stadium. He is the protector of years of LSU Football History and Lore. Death Valley is a great place to enjoy a game if you are an LSU fan. If not, you may find yourself to be called ""Tiger Bait"" and relegated to the South End Zone seats or the nose bleed seats close to heaven.I liked the ease of entry and exit before and after a game. I like the padded chairs on my bleacher seats. Geaux Tigers."

8333,Date of experience: October 2011,2-Aug-12,SEC,Louisiana,5,Welcome to Death Valley!,"If you have ever watched a Saturday night LSU football home game on TV, you probably have heard an announcer say ""There's nothing like being in Tiger Stadium on a Saturday night"" and it's true. (Unless, of course, the Tigers are losing badly.) Tailgating for a Saturday night game begins on Friday afternoon and often lasts until Sunday afternoon after the game when several thousand huge motor homes fill the parking lots around the stadium and hook up chandeliers, big screen TV??s outdoor cooking equipment and their occupants start cooking and  entertaining their friends and any visiting team fans who happen to pass by.  It's also quite a sight to see 70 to 80 thousand LSU fans dressed in their purple and gold outfits on their way to the stadium  - some of the outfits are amazing and very creative. The pregame program begins with LSU's mascot, Mike the Tiger  (a 600 pound Bengal -Siberian tiger mix who lives in his 2 Million Dollar habitat across the street form the stadium) being driven around the stadium floor in his huge gold tiger cage  with the  LSU cheerleaders riding on top. The cheerleaders beat on the sides of his cage and make him roar - the roar is carried on the stadium P.A. system and  everyone cheers when they hear him roar. Next the 350 member Tiger Band comes on the field and begins to play the LSU fight song. They begin with 4 huge trumpet blasts - Dah da daaaa dah! The first blast gets the fans roaring and standing up and the roar continues until the band finishes playing the fight song.  The band splits in front of the goalpost and forms a pathway for the team to run through.  Once the team begins to enter the field, the roars start again and continue until after the kickoff. LSU fans are crazy - they scream and cheer the entire game - not just LSU students but little kids, middle aged fans and even some senior citizens stand up cheering.  After the game ends, thousands of fans stay in the stadium to listen to the band play for  20- 30 minutes. IF you ever get a chance to experience a night game in Tiger Stadium, you will never forget it.  LSU has a large number of international students and although only a few of them know anything about American football,  most of them  LOVE to go to the games because just being in the crowd is such an exhilarating experience."

8340,Date of experience: October 2011,24-Jun-12,SEC,Louisiana,5,One of the most fun places to watch a game...,I have been all over the country going to football games.  This place was one of the best!  The tailgating is top notch.  I even got to field level before the game to see Mike the Tiger.
8342,Date of experience: October 2011,20-Jun-12,SEC,Louisiana,1,if you are not a tiger fane,these people are so mean if you are not a tiger fan and have the audacity to root for another team  they actually spit on me because my team won as i was walikng out of the stadium  i walked out with my eyes down at a very fast pace as the drunks were yelling at me in my face  I WILL NEVER ENTER THIS STADIUM AGAIN FOR ANY REASON  THEY WILL NEVER GET ANY MONEY FROM ME AGAIN
8343,Date of experience: December 2011,18-Jun-12,SEC,Louisiana,5,Death Valley Rocks,LSU's Death Valley is the home of the Tigers and is the most electric stadium in college athletics.  A trip to Death Valley on a Saturday night is like no other.

8346,Date of experience: November 2011,6-Jun-12,SEC,Louisiana,5,No Better Place for Football.,Words cannot describe watching a game here. Top notch excitement that you will never regret experiencing unless.... you don't bleed purple and gold!
8349,Date of experience: December 2011,1-Jun-12,SEC,Louisiana,5,No place like Tiger Stadium,The lights and the fans are awesome!  The atmosphere makes this a great place for football on Saturday night.
8351,Date of experience: November 2011,8-May-12,SEC,Louisiana,5,Where The Football Becomes A Party (or is it vice versa?),"Well, I wrote a review about DKR Memorial Stadium at my two-time alma mater, THE University of Texas, but last fall I had the chance to watch LSU (ranked at the time #1) play against Arkansas (ranked at the time #6) in Tiger Stadium, which is where I grew up as a football fan.  I am the only person in my family (including both of my parents and my brother) to have attended college who DID NOT attend LSU, and both of my kids are threatening to go to LSU, which I would not decry.  LSU is obviously a great university in the great State of Louisiana.  Tiger Stadium: a venue that you just can't imagine until you have been to a football game there.  When my brother was there (ask him about his classmate ""Pistol Pete"" Maravich - but that's another story), the stadium was actually a dorm, and if you roomed there, it was mandatory to throw a party for every home game.  Its a real steep ""bowl,"" and all of the crowd noise is echoed inward (and those South Louisiana folks make a LOT of noise - a friend who played football for Rice once told me that his scariest experience ever was sitting in an air conditioned bus over a mile from Tiger Stadium, at least two hours before game time and hearing the crowd chant ""Tiger Bait Tiger Bait Tiger Bait"" over and over (ask an Arkansas Razorback fan what ""Tiger Bait"" really means).  LSU fans call it ""Death Valley,"" and when you go there you will know why.Tailgating: practically invented at LSU, and it is allowed on campus - a privilege exploited on every game day by tens of thousands of fans, including many who don't even have tickets and pack up, leave and watch the game in nearby bars.  Focus is on drinking and food (lots of both) rather than commercial booths, rock bands and such.  You have never seen so much purple and gold or folks really having fun.The Golden Girls: the original <ahem, how shall I say this> ""pom squad"" (wearing outfits that you definitely do not want to see your daughter in, but will have trouble taking your eyes off). The Golden Band From Tiger Land: a spectacle to behold in essentially the same uniforms I first saw them in 50 years ago.Mascot: I read that our mascot in Texas (Bevo, a full-grown, live longhorn steer) is the second largest mascot in college football; The University of Colorado has the largest (an impressive, full-grown, live American Bison).  Put them both in Tiger Stadium with LSU's mascot, and Mike The Tiger (a full-grown Bengal tiger - for real) would have them both down and eaten for lunch in 15 minutes!  Its worth the trip to Baton Rouge to see Mike's brand new $500,000 complex where the Tiger is king of the swampland.Fans: LSU has the noisiest, rowdiest, drinkingest, most loyal (win, lose or draw - the party goes on) fans in all of sports.  When I first arrived in Austin, I though UT fans (who have greatly improved under Mack Brown) were comatose after being steeped in LSU tradition.  By the way, unlike some other venues I have visited, LSU fans are (for the most part) very welcoming to visiting fans, so don't miss a chance to see a game at LSU, even if you are there with the opposing team (see my Archie Manning story below).  Be on your best behavior though - some folks in Louisiana like to fight, have probably been drinking (duh), and will not shy away from trouble even if they are unlikely to start it.Coaches: loved until hated.  Les Miles currently beloved.  Former coach Nick Saban now known throughout Tigerland as ""Nick Satan"" - say no more.Players: The quickest way to become a household name/hero in Louisiana is to play well in Tiger Stadium.  Just ask Archie Manning who put on an heroic (yet losing) performance playing the entire game against LSU as quarterback for arch-rival Ole Miss with a broken arm during a torrential rain storm (after which LSU fans stood in the rain for 15 minutes chanting ""Archie, Archie, Archie"" - no kidding, I was there!), which made him beloved to LSU fans to this day (electing to play for the New Orleans ""Who Dat?"" Saints when their fans were still wearing bags over their heads sure didn't hurt his rep either).  Who will ever forget Honey Bear, Billy Cannon, and a throng of others whose ups and downs will not stop LSU fans from loving them.Campus: As a UT grad, I have to say that the ""40 acres"" is one of the great college campuses in the U.S.  LSU, however, on the banks of the ""Mighty Mississippi"" is an incredible place.Tickets: You better know someone or have deep pockets.  4 seats to LSU/Arkansas set me back a cool grand, but I would do it again in a heartbeat!Night Football: LSU's website says ""All games start at 7:30,"" and LSU fans are NOT fans of daytime games.  There simply isn't enough time to party unless the game is at night.Party: Did I mention that LSU fans really (I mean REALLY) know how to party?  Every place in town is a party place on game day.Food: OK, I'm a born Cajun, so I'm (what's the word?) weird.  Louisiana has the best food in the world, and that's a fact.  Crawfish, crab, shrimp, every kind of fish dish known to man (try gar balls if you get the chance), jambalaya, etoufee', crawfish bisque (a moment of silence, please), boudin, tasso, andouille, gumbo, soft-shelled crab (hear the sound of angels yet?), barbecue (think steaks - not brisket), stuffed everything you can think of, and just about anything else that doesn't bite first.  If you like food, you will love Louisiana.  If you don't like to eat and drink, stay home.Drinking: allowed, disavowed, entire crowd."
8352,Date of experience: October 2011,26-Apr-12,SEC,Louisiana,5,A religious experience!,"If you are a fan of college football, NOTHING beats a Saturday Night in Death Valley!!!! Get to the campus early on game days. Make sure you make it to see the Golden Band from Tigerland make their way into the stadium (if you are unsure of when or where to see it - just ask someone in Purple and Gold - they will gladly explain to you where to go). Make sure you are in the stadium and in your seat WELL BEFORE kickoff...its not a trip to Tiger Stadium UNLESS you experience the full Pre-game festivities. I have sat in a few different seats all over the stadium over the years and I can't say that their is a bad line of sight for the action on the field. The best games to go to are SEC Saturday NIGHT games! Aurburn, Alabama, Florida are the top three games to get to in my opinion.  After the game is over and make it back to your car, do not be in a hurry to leave campus; traffic can be crazy leaving the campus.I also recommend walking to Mike the Tigers on campus habitat. It is huge! Even if you a fan of the opposing team...you will have a good time...as long as you can take a few chants of ""Tiger Baits!"""

The campus is beautiful also."
8356,Date of experience: November 2011,31-Mar-12,SEC,Louisiana,5,...worship happens here.,"It is a pantheon of concrete and steel. It is a city that rises defiantly in the delta, alongside the Father of Waters. It is the humidity of autumn evenings, beneath stately oaks and broad magnolias. It is haunted and it is loud. It is Halloween night and Canon blasts. It is a Louisiana gumbo of humanity that cheers its Tigers to victory and destroys the dreams of its foes. The chance of rain is NEVER. It is the cathedral of college football, and worship happens here, when the sun finds its home in the Western sky. It is a field of glory, but much more than that. It is a sacred place. It is Saturday Night in Death Valley."

8372,Date of experience: November 2011,4-Feb-12,SEC,Louisiana,3,This is the number 1 attraction in Baton Rouge? That's the problem,"What is all the commotion about?  It is a football stadium.  I guess if you want to see a college football game then by all means, go to Tiger Stadium.  You can meet some friendly people tailgating, but you can also run into many drunk people.  However, there really isn't much to see if you just go ""see it.""  I go to LSU and the campus is okay; the trees are pretty, but most of the buildings are in sore need of repair.  There is one benefit if you do not have interest in a game.  During home football games most restaurants are empty!  I would highly recommend the USS Kidd or LASM or the other museums in Baton Rouge, or the Bluebonnet Swamp Center.  The stadium is NOT the number one attraction!"
8374,Date of experience: September 2011,2-Feb-12,SEC,Louisiana,5,BEST PLACE FOR SEC FOOTBALL,"Great food, football. Plan to stay all day/evening, once you are parked stay enjoy w/ the traffic you are stayin put."
8376,Date of experience: October 2011,23-Jan-12,SEC,Louisiana,5,Death Valley,This is where the LSU rule the house. Great place to be on a Saturday night. Good seating and great people. The history of the stadium is interesting also.
8379,Date of experience: October 2011,7-Jan-12,SEC,Louisiana,5,Best Venue in College Football!,There is no other place like Tiger Stadium! The Atmosphere on game day is unbelievable for Tiger fans. Tailgating outside the stadium before a game is a must to get the full experience! If your a College Football fan a gameday visit to Tiger Stadium will be something you never forget!
8380,Date of experience: December 2011,2-Jan-12,SEC,Louisiana,3,First trip,"It was just OK.  Maybe because it was December, but it looked uninviting.  It's all football stadium."
8382,Date of experience: September 2011,29-Dec-11,SEC,Louisiana,5,geaux tigers,"The elevator ride up to the tiger den suites is always interesting, as they like to cram quite a few people into each one.  Cell reception is usually nonexistent for me once I'm in the stadium, but other than that, I always have a blast here."
8387,Date of experience: December 2011,1-Dec-11,SEC,Louisiana,5,Most electric place to be on a Saturday during football season!!!,Great place to be for an LSU football game.  The variety of food and beverages is great and the people are tons of fun to enjoy the game.
8388,Date of experience: October 2011,28-Nov-11,SEC,Louisiana,5,Mike The Tiger. Best College Mascot.,Where else can you walk up on a campus to see and hear a huge bengal tiger? It's amazing. The stadium is best when it's full of people on game day.
8389,Date of experience: November 2011,28-Nov-11,SEC,Louisiana,5,Nothing like Death Valley,"We take our children to a game very year at Tiger Stadium. This year we went to the Homecoming Game in November. We had so much fun walking around and enjoying the other fans. Sorority row was decorated, and there was live music and food vendors outside the stadium. Everyone must experience 1 game in this stadium!"
8390,Date of experience: November 2011,28-Nov-11,SEC,Louisiana,5,LSU Arkansas,Good tailgating! Easy access to bathrooms.Bag search not over the top.
8391,Date of experience: August 2011,28-Nov-11,SEC,Louisiana,5,Electric Avenue!!!,A day at Tiger Stadium on game day should be on every persons bucket list.  No longer a every game attendee but the vibe just never dies.  Put on your walking shoes and come hungry.  The friendliest fans anywhere!!!
8392,Date of experience: November 2011,28-Nov-11,SEC,Louisiana,5,Been a lot of Places - Few even Compare,"I suppose I'm biased because I did graduate from here, but clearly Tiger Stadium is a ""must visit"" if you consider yourself a college football fan.  I have been to all opponent stadiums in the SEC and many other stadiums in the West, SW and Midwest - can't say that many are in the same class but Tuscaloosa and Auburn are in the mix for sure.  Most of these stadiums are kept up meticulously despite their ages and Tiger Stadium doesn't disappoint in that regard.  Add in the beautiful campus and friendly tailgating and it is a hard package to not enjoy."
8393,Date of experience: November 2011,16-Nov-11,SEC,Louisiana,5,GO LSU,"We had a great time. Game was great. The stadium was most impressive. Purple and Gold. The spirit of the crowd was wonderful.  I started crying when I first saw the field, bigger than life.  As the team comes running through, fireworks were set off. We were sitting in the upper deck, but we could see everything.  I am hooked. Refreshments could have tasted better. but who cares, we went to a restuarant later for supper."
8394,Date of experience: September 2011,7-Nov-11,SEC,Louisiana,5,GEAUX TIGERS!!,"I miss this stadium like crazy.  It is so much fun, if you're a student or otherwise.  I know my parents always had a great time wherever they ended up with tickets for (usually the other side of the stadium).  The tailgating doesn't get any better.  If you have time to walk around the campus, do it, it's absolutely beautiful.  A true SEC school gem."
8395,Date of experience: October 2011,31-Oct-11,SEC,Louisiana,5,Beautiful Campus a must see,"WOW, The very old and huge and beautiful oak trees are so amazing. Inside the stadium is awesome too. Worth a trip to Baton Rouge to catch a game. Geaux Tigers"

8400,Date of experience: October 2011,5-Oct-11,SEC,Louisiana,5,"Atmosphere, atmosphere, atmosphere","Tiger Stadium is about more than a football game. Its about soaking up everything around the game before and after. Never seen tailgating like this before. You have to be there to believe it. These are not football fans, they are football worshipers. There is no scene like this outside of the SEC. Tailgating where I come from in Big 10 country is flipping hot dogs and burgers on a grill while tapping a keg. LSU fans barbecue alligator, have full premium liquor bars and televisions built into trailers that are better than most home tvs. If you go, plan to spend many hours before and after the game. In fact, going to the game isn't even really necessary to get the jist of this experience."
8401,Date of experience: September 2011,16-Sep-11,SEC,Louisiana,5,Tiger Bait !!!!,"You're either a Tiger or you are Tiger Bait!!!On Saturday night the visiting team will understand the nickname ""Death Valley""!!! It's LOUD, bright, vibrant and literally ground shaking!!!!!There is no other place in the world like Tiger Stadium during football season.The tailgating is the best anywhere; the food is supurb, friends are great and the visitors are always welcome for some good ole cajun hospitality... and good natured ribbing.Wear purple and gold and you'll blend right in; wear the opposing teams colors and you'll hear ""Tiger Bait!"" all day long!!!Come early and stay late!

I just wore red no-names. Congrats to both teams I hope I have the same dilemma next season. Enjoy going to both home games."
8409,Date of experience: November 2021,12-Feb-22,SEC,Georgia,5,Go Dawgs,If you are an SEC fan it is a must do to check out between the hedges. Saturdays in Athens are like nothing else!  Wear your red and black!
8410,Date of experience: November 2021,16-Nov-21,SEC,Georgia,4,On campus stadium,It was interesting you are able to view inside the stadium along the road. Impressed stadium is right on campus.
8411,Date of experience: October 2021,24-Oct-21,SEC,Georgia,5,The most beautiful on-campus stadium,"The first time my wife and I saw Sanford Stadium at the University of Georgia in Athens, we stopped our car on the Gillis Bridge or Sanford Bridge, a major transportation artery to the stadium, and marveled at the view of the interior of the stadium and the campus and the rolling hills from the open west end zone of what has been referred to as the ""most beautiful on-campus stadium"" in the country. Today, that view is gone. In 1991, the west end zone was enclosed, creating a partial bowl. And in 2005, a 52-foot by 76-foot scoreboard was installed in the west end zone to completely blot out the view from the bridge. Along the way, after an upper deck was added to the north side in 2003, the capacity was increased from 86,000 to 92,746. Sanford Stadium is the 11th largest stadium in the United States and the 17th largest in the world. It is one of only two Southeastern Conference schools where the football field is oriented to face east-west instead of north-south. But, most of all, what sets Sanford Stadium apart from others are the privet hedges, which were part of the original design when the stadium opened in 1929. The current hedges were planted in 1996. ""Playing between the hedges"" on a natural grass surface is a traditional theme when opponents come to Athens to play the Georgia Bulldogs."
8412,Date of experience: October 2021,2-Oct-21,SEC,Georgia,5,"Great food, service, and entertainment",Short lines at this beautiful stadium. Friendly employees at the snack bars. Clean restrooms. Great fan base. Highly recommend!
8413,Date of experience: October 2019,8-Apr-20,SEC,Georgia,4,Home Away From Home,"Been a football season ticket holder dating to when Hershel Owned the House--and the SEC. The food's gotten better and more varied, and the scoreboard is a technical marvel--one of the best in the world. I'd give it 5 stars if the bathrooms were more modern--and if there was another national championship flag flying overhead."
8414,Date of experience: November 2019,10-Feb-20,SEC,Georgia,5,Beautiful!!,GO DAWGS!! Hubby and I stopped by on our way out of town to get a few pics!! Beautiful Fall foliage surrounding Stadium.

8416,Date of experience: November 2019,15-Dec-19,SEC,Georgia,5,Georgia Fans Have Class,"I'm a Texas Aggie who has been to road games all over the country.  Our experience at Georgia ranks among the best.  From the economics-major student we talked to on the way to the stadium to the woman who high-fived me and said ""good game"" on the way out, friendly people made us feel welcome.  I have a lot of respect for your fine university."
8417,Date of experience: November 2019,27-Nov-19,SEC,Georgia,3,TAMU v UG Football Game,"The stadium is somewhat dated, but nice.  The seats are comfortable and the concession stands are adequate.  The Georgia fans are extremely friendly and welcoming.  The access to the stadium is only by walking...there doesn't appear to be any vehicle parking at the stadium.  It was a very enjoyable experience.  I will definitely return when our schedules cross again."
8418,Date of experience: November 2019,27-Nov-19,SEC,Georgia,3,Medium Sized SEC Stadium,"Came into town for the Texas A&M vs Georgia Bulldog game, Nov 23, 2019.  The stadium is a typical large football stadium, especially in the SEC.  Gate 2 is a cluster as there was no inspection of clear bags coming into the stadium and we saw many people with flasks and bottles inside the stadium that really needed to be tossed out since they were inebriated.  Stadium needs to be updated as the restrooms are too few for the crowd as the game goes on. Once you get into the stadium, it was easy to get to the 2nd and 3rd levels and back out after the game with the escalators as traffic flow was better than most stadiums.Light show was good at the end of the 3rd qtr, but there was just too much piped in noise, not the noise from the energy of the crowd.  Stadium did keep the crowd involved in the game.......Scoreboard could use an upgrade.  I would rate this stadium about the same as Clemson or South Carolina's."
8419,Date of experience: October 2019,5-Nov-19,SEC,Georgia,5,world class,"I've watched sporting events and concerts in venues all over the country and a few continents.  The overall production in Athens is the best.  The stadium is beautiful and the place is in excellent condition.  The pregame show is incredible, and the bear between the 3rd and 4th quarters with the light show and crowd participation is world-class.  My only complaint is the ushers at the top of the aisles should be more efficient.  Our seats are in a section where the walkway ends, and people sitting below the 35th row come to a dead end.  They should have been instructed to go down the adjacent aisle."
8420,Date of experience: September 2019,16-Oct-19,SEC,Georgia,4,Great Experience,"There's nothing finer in the land! The atmosphere, the people, the traditions. It will leave a lasting impression."

8423,Date of experience: September 2019,30-Sep-19,SEC,Georgia,5,UGA vs. Notre Dame,"Regarding actually watching a football game, I'm not sure there is any better stadium in the country.   Seats are good.  No obstructions that I am aware of. Room is right for your seat (not too small).  And UGA does a great job of enhancing the fan experience on the field beyond their great football team.  The LED light show they did prior to the 4th quarter was awesome and unlike anything I've ever seen at any stadium for any event, anywhere.Concessions and bathroom lines are terrible, so much so that I never ate anything.   Had to wait it out to go to bathroom."
8424,Date of experience: September 2019,23-Sep-19,SEC,Georgia,5,THE DAWG HOUSE,"Home of the UGA Bulldogs Football and some of the greatest Saturdays in my life since I was a Freshman in 1988.

8425,Date of experience: September 2019,23-Sep-19,SEC,Georgia,5,Amazing!,"Sanford Stadium was amazing!  I've never seen or been to a game that all the UGA fans were into the game and hype. Difficult stadium to win if you're the opposing team. The UGA fans were polite and welcoming to us, Go Irish! ??"
8426,Date of experience: September 2019,22-Sep-19,SEC,Georgia,5,Great!,Going to a game here is amazing!  Love the vibe and crowd. Everyone is friendly and welcoming. Hard not to get swept up in the Dawg fandom no matter what team your hail from.
8427,Date of experience: September 2019,11-Sep-19,SEC,Georgia,5,Amazing stadium!,"Loved finally seeing a game.  Very neat stadium - loved the hedges.  Great area, campus, game.  Very fun time.

8428,Date of experience: September 2019,8-Sep-19,SEC,Georgia,5,Skybox Review,"Had the pleasure of attending a UGA football game in a skybox. Given the very hot weather I was thrilled to be in the air conditioning! We entered through a special entrance that takes you to two designated elevators manned by student ushers. Each box has its own bathroom!!! The view of the game is great and there are at least two TVs in the box along with a mini kitchen. For dinner we had brisket and chicken along with Mac-n-cheese, corn and tomato salad, rolls, and cornbread. The dinner was very good. Snacks (popcorn, ice cream, a dessert buffet, a candy buffet for kids, hot dogs, and coffee are all found in the common area near the elevators. I was impressed with both the ice cream and dessert selections. The kids loved it! At a coffee bar you can grab a specialty or regular coffee."

8434,Date of experience: September 2018,15-Feb-19,SEC,Georgia,5,Football,"Never miss a home game and very few away games. Go with family and friends all ages.

8438,Date of experience: November 2018,15-Jan-19,SEC,Georgia,5,Sanford Stadium rocks!,"We have been season ticket holders for over 20 years.  We have progressed from the ""sunny side""  which will fry you to the shady side.  I love the Georgia Bulldogs and love our stadium.Now that I'm older, I do not go very often.  I cannot do the stairs and the top rows don't have hand rails.  But our family still goes and enjoys the games."
8439,Date of experience: December 2018,5-Jan-19,SEC,Georgia,5,"Georgia, Georgia Tech game","Great stadium  with plenty of tail gating locations within easy walking distance to the stadium.   Food prices are a bit stiff, but the quality is good."

8445,Date of experience: November 2018,20-Nov-18,SEC,Georgia,3,First and last visit,The seats are hard on your back. It??s concrete. Couldn??t stay the whole game because I was in pain. No beer. Paid $22 for plain hamburgers with potato chips and bottled drink. Never again. I suppose we are too old to do all this walking and climbing. Will watch from home next time. Go dawgs! It was ok for our first time ever.

I have watched this stadium improve and expand over many years to the very best in the SEC.  It is beautiful, well designed and comfortable even with a full house of 94,000 fans."
8448,Date of experience: November 2018,6-Nov-18,SEC,Georgia,5,Loud noises,"People scream here. They drink beer and yell at people they don??t know and eat hotdogs and talk with their mouths full. They bark at each other, too. Temporary insanity happens here regularly. Bring your camera and don??t cheer for anyone not wearing red and black. Trust me on this one."
8449,Date of experience: October 2018,28-Oct-18,SEC,Georgia,4,Great Stadium,"Went on a Sunday while on a short course to UGA during the fall break. The day was sunny, and I was the only person in the stadium. The empty stadium looks great (I'm not much of an American Football fan). Go DAWGS!"

8452,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Oct-18,SEC,Georgia,5,Love Sanford Stadium,"We visited for the GA vs Tennessee Game.  It was unbelievably hot and unfortunately, we weren't sitting in the club section which is covered and features ceiling fans.  So,before halftime, we retreated to the Tate Student Center which is located on the other side of the bridge and is a 30 second walk.  The Tate center has a movie theater (air conditioned) where they show the game.  This was a great option for us."
8453,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Oct-18,SEC,Georgia,5,New video screen and west section,The new additions to the stadium are great. Love the new big screen.  The viewing section on the west side is very nice.

8458,Date of experience: September 2018,16-Sep-18,SEC,Georgia,5,Always a great game day experience.,"I am biased, but this is classic D1 football in a stadium with open views to the west, updated facilities and some of the best fans you will find.  This visit we watched a 16year old daughter of a friend get her first taste of the tradition and pageantry of SEC football-her grin and the look in her eyes was priceless."
8459,Date of experience: September 2018,8-Sep-18,SEC,Georgia,4,Dawgs home field is great!,The stadium is ever improving. The new Jumbotron is terrific.  Bathrooms are well placed and laid out. Nothing like being between the hedges!
8460,Date of experience: September 2018,4-Sep-18,SEC,Georgia,5,FABULOUS  VENUE  ON  A  BRUTALLY  HOT  DAY,"My  wife  and  I  made  our  annual  College  Football  Labor  Day  trek  to  the  University  of  Georgia  this  year,  and  spent  September  1st  in  Sanford  Stadium.It  was  a  ridiculously  hot  day,  but  we  were  cautious  and  hung  in  until  the  4th  quarter,  before  departing.   Sanford  announced  a  capacity  crowd  of  92,746,  but  guessing  90,000  were  there  at  kickoff  (not  100%  full),  MANY  less  after  halftime  when  the  game  was  no  longer  in  doubt  and  the  heat  was  brutal.   Things  to  note:  1)  The  adjacent  Tate  Student  Center  was  a  madhouse  before  the  game,  both  with  fans  needing  air  conditioning,  and  its  close  proximity  to  Sanford  for  food  and  facilities.   Make  sure  you  find  a  pre-game  place  to  sit  in  Tate  (as  we  did,  since  we  did  not  tailgate  anywhere - Ate  lunch  in  town).                               2)  Need  Georgia  gear? -  NEVER  saw  so  much  stuff  as  we  saw  in  the  adjacent  UGA  Bookstore!   Probably  a  bit  pricey  (we  did  not  buy  anything  there),  but  NO  excuse  for  not  finding  something  ""  Dawg ""  to  wear!Might  be  cheaper  to  buy  UGA  stuff  at  ""  The  Red  Zone  "" on  Clayton  Street  in  Athens.                               3)  Serious  school  spirit  -  These  folks  LOVE  their  ""  Dawgs "" -bigtime  early  game  support,  a  very  huge  place,  but  lots  of  fun! -""  Sic 'em...Woof!  Woof!  Woof! ""           If  you  go...??.(depending  on  gametime  and  weather  that  day)                a)  The  ONLY  shade  is  supplied  by  the  press  box  and  suites  on  the  South  (home)  side  of  the  stadium  (which  we  did) - Sections  327 - 335??...The  north  side  and  east  end  zone  seats  are  totally  in  the  sun....parts  of  the  south  side  can  be  as  well.   Depending  on  the  temp  on  the  day  you  go,  buy  your  seats  accordingly.                b)  Stadium  had  sufficient  lavatories,  and  concession  stands...??.Concourses  were  wide  enough,  and  plenty  of  signs  to  find  your  section.  A  huge  but  fun  place  to  visit.....easily  handled  by  us  as  first-timers.  Escalators  to  the  upper  decks  available on  the  North  side  of  stadium......did  not  see  any  on  the  south  side,  but  might  have  missed  them.                c)   Watch  the  walk  -  if  you  park  or  Uber  to  downtown,  it  is  DOWNHILL  walking  from  Broad  Street  to  Sanford,  but  UPHILL  going  back!   Parking  was  available  in  town  in  the  $  15.00-30.00  range  if  you  did  not  arrange  something  in  advance....we  parked  outside  of  town, and  Ubered  to  the  campus.                d)  Even  if  tickets  are  cheap.....DO  NOT  sit  in  the  600  level  on  the  North  side  of  the  stadium.....seats  are  INCREDIBLY  high  and  far  from  the  field,  and  with  limited  opportunity  to  move  down,  as  the  place  is  full.                e)  We  used  this  recommendation  -  If  coming  to  Athens  from  the  west  (such  as  Atlanta,  which  we  did) - DON'T  use  Route  316  -  Stay  on  I-85  to  the  exit  for  Route  129  heading  south  into  Athens......Very  little  traffic,  not  many  lights,  ends  up  right  downtown.          Overall....a  wonderful  campus  experience  despite  the  enormous  numbers  of  folks  attending.   One  other  suggestion:  Unless  you  can  get  an  elevated  seat  to  see,  skip  the  ""  Dawg  Walk ""  outside  of  Tate   2+ hours  before  the  game.  Leave  that  to  the  diehards."

Plenty of restrooms.  Handicap help if you need it.   (Wish there were better parking options for this...as you have to park at east campus and ride the bus to get there.  The downside is it??s the exact opposite from the side we have our seats and we can??t leave early if needed due to the busses not running until the game is over.  If there were ever an emergency, it would be rough.  Luckily we don??t have to worry about it except when our friend comes to town.  This does need to be addressed though.). Back to the bathrooms.  They??re usually attended so backups, empty toilet rolls/paper towels are promptly taken care of.  Staff is always friendly.  Screen only gets better.  An upgrade is on the way for next season and there was nothing wrong with the last one.  Only thing missing is a new national championship banner there...??????"

I have been to games all over the US - including many SEC schools, Pac12 and Mountain West.  Sanford Stadium rocks - from where it sits on campus, to the atmosphere on game day to the night games.  If you are a college football fan - it has to be on your bucket list."
8491,Date of experience: October 2017,22-Oct-17,SEC,Georgia,5,"If you are a football fan, must see a game between The Hedges","I followed my Missouri Tigers to Athens as part of my goal to see a Tigers game in all of the SEC stadiums.  This classic stadium and field did not disappoint.  The fans are very much into the game, which creates a fan-tastic experience.  The stadium is within easy walking distance of the downtown establishments.  There seemed to be ample parking in the area.  Be ready to walk some stairs if you have a seat in the lower rows of a section.  Being an older and very large stadium, there aren't many levels to reduce stairs, so you may have to up to 80-90 stairs to reach the lowest seats.  Local fans treat visitors with respect and kindness."

8497,Date of experience: September 2017,2-Oct-17,SEC,Georgia,5,Great Place to Watch Foorball,"Sanford Stadium is a must see tfor all new comers to Athens.  If you like football, you'll love it here, a beautiful field, great stadium , and one of the better pre game tail gating experiences you'll find.  The concourses can get a bit crowded, and lines long, but the stadium has significantly improved food options in the past few years, and you won't find a crowd having much more fun than the rapid Bulldog fans."
8498,Date of experience: November 2016,2-Oct-17,SEC,Georgia,3,A Georgia Classic,"I was a student at UGA and later worked for UGA for many years and had the opportunity to be in this stadium MANY times from 1978 until 2007. Since I retired I haven't been much. I would love to give it a 5 star rating simply because it IS Sanford Stadium and a Georgia institution. But this review is to give what I feel is a realistic view of Sanford Stadium.Remember this stadium was built in 1929. It has had numerous renovations over the years, but it is still on the 1929 ""framework."" It is important to know when coming to an event at Sanford Stadium that while it is fully in line with all pertinent laws regarding access for disabled persons, it is NOT and ideal venue for persons with mobility issues. It is hard to get around in this stadium even when not completely full, and when at capacity it can be impossible in certain areas (in particular the North side around the student section during football games. The concourse will completely jam up.)For large events, such as football games, the parking is atrocious. But there is NOTHING UGA can do about that. This is a ""landlocked"" stadium, there are buildings all around it and very little parking. If you are coming to a large event, arrive really early.  Really, really early. And check with UGA for any parking info pertinent to the event you are attending.As for the food, it is typical stadium fare. The food is provided by whoever has the contract for that year. For football in 2017, it's Dreamland BBQ. It's all pricey and only so-so. Do be aware ALL bottled drinks will have their top removed by the concession workers and you will not be given that top. The reason is to prevent people from using the full bottles to throw off the upper decks/or at other people. When full of liquid than can cause injuries. That's the reality of Sanford Stadium. And it's faults can be part of it's charm as well! But all that being said, I would say it is a ""don't miss"" attraction if you are in Athens! The mascots are all buried here and it is interesting to see those graves. As well as the infamous privet hedge ""hedges."" (If you are thinking about trying to run through the hedge to get on the field, don't. There is a chain link fence running through the middle of the hedge. The hedge is thick and you can't see the fence, but it's there!)I will always love Sanford Stadium. Just like a member of the family, it might not be perfect, but I love it all the same!!!"
8499,Date of experience: September 2017,26-Sep-17,SEC,Georgia,5,College Football at It??s Finest,"Had a child attend UGA and graduate but never attended a football game. I use to say ??Go Dogs?? automatically when the word bulldog, the colors red and black or Athens was mentioned. I use to go into a low growl when, Clemson,Auburn, Gamecocks etc, etc, were mentioned.  Never understood it until I finally attended a game. We,my son and husband went to a night game. We watched as the crowd(s) performed pre-game rituals in tail gate tents and at the campus commons. We marveled at the painted people, yeah there were people there painted red with black markings.And of course the bulldog Uggie?,(I think that was his name)in his great dog house on the field. The crowd pointing in unison to indicate first half. And last but not least, one of the best college bands kicking starting off the game and keeping the fans pumped. I still become breathless in the retelling of my experience!     I loved it!  One thing, Do Not Bring Any Bags or Purses UNLESS in Clear   Plastic!! You Will Not Be Allowed In The STADIUM!!      NO EXCEPTIONS. Be safe."

Seating is comfortable (obviously tested them before the game started and once more at halftime). Snacks are great and decent price. Bathrooms..... well.....you're in a stadium with 75,000 close (mostly drunk) friends that don't have any aim. Not a bad seat in the house. Jumbotron can be seen from everywhere. All in all, a great experience."

8514,Date of experience: October 2016,9-May-17,SEC,Georgia,5,Home of the Dawgs,It is a wonderful place to be on a Saturday for a home game day.  The population of the county doubles on game days so be prepared for traffic.  Lots of tailgate options available.

8526,Date of experience: September 2016,20-Feb-17,SEC,Georgia,4,Large Crowds for Football Saturday!,"Wifi is spotty and with all the cell phones trying to post/text/update it gets worse!   Bathrooms aren't the best. Food lines are long (but they would be for 90k plus fans) trying to get a drink and a hotdog!  Cost for food/drinks is on par with the rest of the sports world...but the hotdog quality could be better for the price.  Also, if you don't have a ""stadium seatback"" you run the risk of not being able to fit into your seat.  Seatbacks define ""YOUR"" seat and you know just exactly how much space you have (also...they have a back to lean on)  The seats aren't seats as much as long benches and not defined without the seatback.  The guy next to us, sold 2 of his tickets every game and there were a couple of people who really spread out when they sat down....without the seatback, you squeeze in and can't move!  Games are what they are.  Win or lose, you are either part of the Dawg Nation or you aren't!  We can tell those that aren't!  The stadium is in the top 10 for size in the country and it's got a lot to offer for fans!  GO Dawgs!"

Cell service is minimal and no in-stadium wi-fi.  One Jumbotron, so if you're in the open endzone, you can't see it without turning around. Bad system of getting fans around. If everyone is going one way, you're worse than a salmon swimming upstream. The scenery and location is very convenient for an on-campus stadium. Stadium security was solid for entrants and searches."

8548,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,SEC,Georgia,5,UGA vs. Nichols State,"Sanford Stadium is my home away from home. Lifelong Dawg fan and have been to this hallowed field of play literally all of my life. You've never seen a more beautiful campus or college football stadium. From tailgating to the Dawg Walk to the Redcoat Band playing Glory Glory with solo trumpet on top of the stadium, the video board coming to life and the iconic voice of Larry Munson saying ""Glory Glory to old Georgia""....gets me choked up everytime. Can't wait until my toddler is old enough to go and handle the noise."
8549,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,SEC,Georgia,3,Fun experience,"This was our first time at a Bulldogs game. The Dawgs won but the game was terrible (barely beat Nichols State). We sat on the North side, section 305 and couldn't have been hotter. It was 92 at game time but it felt like 102. The lines for drinks were long and slow. At least the drinks were nice and cold - but, so was the pizza. One nice thing is that they had a large tank of water that you could use to refill water bottles and cups for free. As for getting there, plan on lots of traffic on the way in so bring your patience. For parking, I highly suggest purchasing a parking pass since many of the lots near the stadium don't take cash. Overall, it was fun watching them play and watching the fans show so much support for the team."

8555,Date of experience: September 2015,22-Aug-16,SEC,Georgia,5,Finest Stadium In  The Land,I started going to Georgia football games at Sanford Stadium before the addition of the first upper decks in the 1960's.  Without question there is no other stadium that can match it for the college football experience.  Even if you aren't a football fan you should make it a point to spend a Saturday between the hedges.
8556,Date of experience: August 2016,20-Aug-16,SEC,Georgia,4,For the Love of Football and NCAA sports,My wife is a HUGE NCAA sports fan (Football and Basketball).  Lately our trips always involve stopping at universities and finding the stadiums (I think that will be our agenda for retirement travels).  Walking the campus was great and when we finally found the Stadium it was a really nice stadium and worth the nice walk on a hot and humid summers day.
8557,Date of experience: August 2016,11-Aug-16,SEC,Georgia,5,Home Of The UGA Dogs,"A beautiful  and awe inspiring place to visit and watch Georgia play. The history, The legends that played there and The hedges; what else  is  there to say."
8558,Date of experience: September 2015,3-Aug-16,SEC,Georgia,5,Best Place for GA Football!,Fall Saturday's are the best for Football!  I have grown up coming to GA games and just love this place!
8559,Date of experience: November 2015,26-Jul-16,SEC,Georgia,5,Dawg's Home,"Been coming to the stadium for over 45 years.  Being here on game day brings backmemories, chills and a few tears. After traveling to most other SEC schools, this stadium and campus is at the top.  History and old campus brings you back again and again."
8560,Date of experience: November 2015,20-Jul-16,SEC,Georgia,4,Home of the Dawgs!,"We have lots of memories here.  And they go way back too - lotsa football, bands -- remember the Dixie Redcoat Band? Good memories all, no disrespect just good time and great Memories!!  Herschel Walker comes to mind now!!  Many others too.  If you are in the area, stop by and walk around and soak up the history.  And, remember, GO DAWGS!!"

8566,Date of experience: September 2015,7-Jun-16,SEC,Georgia,5,Welcome to God's Country!,"What can I say about this iconic place that hasn't already been said? Sanford Stadium is like no other. I simply cannot imagine a better place to spend a Saturday with your family than in Athens, Georgia. This is like going to a family reunion with 92,000 of your closest family and friends. Parking is always an issue in Athens, so come early! Be sure to venture down to the Tate Student Center parking lot to witness the Dawg Walk! Go Dawgs!"
8567,Date of experience: September 2015,1-Jun-16,SEC,Georgia,5,You have to enjoy game day in Athens at least once in your life,"Opening with the Dawg Walk by the famous Red Coat Marching Band, the excitement of the day along with all the enthusiasm of the student body is something you should experience first hand.  The walkway outside the Stadium is the perfect setting for the grand entrance of the team, cheer leaders and coaches as the Band surrounds them and the hundreds of fans cheer from bridges, stairways and balconies.  If you can't get tickets come to Athens anyway for the ""Walk"" then spend the day at a restaurant watching, eating and cheering!"
8569,Date of experience: September 2015,12-May-16,SEC,Georgia,5,GO DAWGS - Wonderful Afternoon,We attended a football game as part of parent's weekend in September.  Our daughter is a freshman at UGA this year.  The stadium ts clean and well maintained..  We were staying at the Holiday Inn Express nearby so we walked to the stadium.  Parking looked crazy difficult as there seems to be no parking near the stadium.The school spirit was loud and fun and the Bulldogs won so it was a great afternoon.  We will definitely plan another visit on a game day weekend next year.
8574,Date of experience: September 2015,21-Apr-16,SEC,Georgia,5,This is big!,"Stanford Stadium fits nicely into a natural valley between the North Campus and the South Campus of the University of Georgia. Seating about 93.000 it is the largest stadium in Georgia and one of the largest in the SE.  Opened in 1929 with a seating capacity of 30,000 its capacity has progressively increased over the years with the addition of tastefully designed upper decks. Also, over the years concession and bathroom facilities have been upgraded significantly. A special feature of the stadium is the privet hedge which entirely surrounds the playing field. Games are billed as being played ""between the hedges"" which are an attractive and practical feature since they prevent fans from storming onto the field to celebrate (except once in 2000 when Georgia beat Tennessee)."
8580,Date of experience: December 2015,29-Mar-16,SEC,Georgia,5,"One of the iconic stadia in the country, ""between the hedges"".","A lot has changed since I came here, first on Band Days to play on the field at halftime during Homecoming back in the '60s, then when I attended UGA in the Early '70s. Needless to say, Sanford has morphed into a monstrous stadium to equal any in the country. You can't see the game from the RR tracks, like in my day, you have to buy a ticket, but it is still a great place to watch a game."
8581,Date of experience: November 2015,13-Mar-16,SEC,Georgia,5,Fun times between the hedges,"Raised as a Georgia fan in the South is great on Saturdays in the Fall you can go to a place called home which is Athens, Georgia. Georgia Fans are nice and Friendly"
8582,Date of experience: November 2015,5-Mar-16,SEC,Georgia,5,Football in the South!,"I have been to football games at numerous venues.  Alabama, Auburn, LSU, UNC, Ohio State, Michigan State to name a few.  All have their own vibe and energy on game day.  BUT - I have yet to go to another stadium that is located in such a great setting, provides excellent sight lines and ability to move within the stadium.  UGA has its own tailgating vibe. Georgia fans tend to be a bit more gentile.  Not that people aren't enjoying themselves, you just don't get the level of craziness and crassness I've experienced at other venues.Bottom line - if I wanted to pick a place to watch a football game, Sanford Stadium sits at the top."
8583,Date of experience: October 2015,29-Feb-16,SEC,Georgia,5,God's Country,"Okay, as a Georgia alum, I'm biased. But Sanford is a good stadium for viewing a game with good sightlines all around. And, of course, the crowd brings Southern football passion to the proceedings. Sitting right smack in the middle of campus gives Sanford an atmosphere most other stadiums don't possess. Unlike the single giant parking lot tailgate scene at many stadiums, the Athens scene varies from big parking lots full of people to a few chairs and a grill under an oak tree. Throw in the fact that Athens is one of America's great college towns??downtown is  short walk from the stadium??and you have a Saturday as good as it gets. Bathrooms can definitely have waits and the concessions are so-so but you're here for SEC football. And if you've never been to an SEC showdown, you owe it to yourself to attend one, whether it's here, Tuscaloosa, Baton Rouge, wherever."
8584,Date of experience: October 2015,18-Feb-16,SEC,Georgia,5,Wonderful time between the hedges,"Great time at Sanford Stadium watching the Bulldogs play.  To be perfectly honest my husband and I, who are both senior citizens, were there for the primary purpose of seeing our son perform in the UGA marching band.  But it was a great experience.  Tail-gating was great too"
8585,Date of experience: October 2015,8-Feb-16,SEC,Georgia,5,Iconic Southern Football experience.,"I grew up going to football games at UGA and even went to college there my last 2 years.  One really has to go to a football game there to experience the palpable energy. The crowds and parking are a bit of a hassle but that is really a part of the whole feel. Even if you can't go to the game, you can stand on the bridge and look over it to see the hedges. Very well maintained. The bookstore is also a must with very unique UGA souvenirs."

8588,Date of experience: January 2016,14-Jan-16,SEC,Georgia,5,Beautiful stadium on campus,Home of Georgia Bulldogs football. Beautiful setting on campus. Great sight lines and gives you the feeling of being close to the field. Seats 92K + fans. One of the largest in the SEC and country. Known for its Privet hedges surrounding the playing field.

8590,Date of experience: September 2015,4-Jan-16,SEC,Georgia,5,Goooo DAWGS!,"Even though I am married to an avid GEORGIA fan, with several of our daughters attending UGA, I had never been in the stadium. For years I wanted to attend just one game in the stadium for the experience of being there. We FINALLY went to the South Carolina game last fall, it was totally amazing! It was a RED out game, the atmosphere was so exciting, the fans were great. It was something to actually see the hedges and Que sitting outside his doghouse on the sidelines. The stadium was very clean and well maintained. The weather was absolutely perfect for an early evening game. We tailgated before the game a few blocks away with a fun group of alumni, friends, and family. So, so much fun! You could not ask for more!"
8591,Date of experience: November 2015,10-Dec-15,SEC,Georgia,5,Goooooo Dawgs!!!,This stadium is fantastic! There is a refreshment to meet your wants/needs. Watching the Dawgs play between the hedges is the best way to spend any football Saturday.

8596,Date of experience: October 2015,17-Nov-15,SEC,Georgia,5,Best stadium to watch a game at.,It's a great stadium with plenty of seating.  Once you get into the stadium you can pretty much sit anywhere until you're asked to move.  Fans were nice enough.

There are no bad seats in the stadium; each section gives you a little different view to enjoy the game. The atmosphere is always amazing; fans young and old gather together to enjoy the traditions Georgia has to offer. This is a must-see/must-visit for any SEC or even college football fan. The fan base is always very friendly and you always feel right at home cheering on the Dawgs."

8603,Date of experience: October 2015,6-Oct-15,SEC,Georgia,3,Typical College Stadium!,Me and boyfriend just went to the game to see our Alabama boys play for his birthday. The stadium is nice but all the steps you have to walk is kinda ridiculous. Also not being able to take your umbrellas inside is kind of wack. It was raining not stop but at the same time I guess they dont want anyone to get hit. All around it was just ok my team won so no real complaints here.

In my opinion, it is worth the price to sit on the second level.  You have your own restrooms and eating facilities, PLUS you are protected from the weather.  Considering the price you pay to see a game, you will always see it in comfort, and not have to worry about the weather."

I have been in other college stadiums, and Sanford Stadium is unsurpassed. The fans are usually electric, especially for a big game, and can give opposing quarterbacks fits calling audible plays on the field. If you sit near the student section, expect to stand the whole game. The jumbotron is state-of-the art and with the accompanied sound system, provides entertainment before the game and during breaks in the action on the field."
8659,Date of experience: December 2014,2-Dec-14,SEC,Georgia,3,not much to see here,"I work by the stadium and see it every day. If you are visiting athens and not going to a football game, then don't waste your time seeing the stadium: there's not much to see. Lots of empty seats and a field of grass and some hedges around the field that cover up the fact that there are fences there. Spend you time on North campus, or the far South campus by the Art Museum. The stadium used to be cool back in the day when it wasn't so big.

8661,Date of experience: November 2014,25-Nov-14,SEC,Georgia,5,My favorite venue!,"The atmosphere in Sanford Stadium is always motivating and upbeat, even when the game is not a major rivalry.  When the big games are played here, it is unbelieveably incredible!  People are friendly and fun, the concessions are good and the sporting events are always top notch.  The surrounding tailgating parties are always extravagant."
8662,Date of experience: November 2014,21-Nov-14,SEC,Georgia,5,Go Dawgs,"The stadium continues to get more user friendly each year.  They have ample concession stands and good service.  As with any stadium, the snack bars and bathrooms have lines at high activity times like half-time and pregame.  Every seat is a good one and there is also a large TV at the north end.  The NCAA now allows colleges to play other games on the TV so you can see college football highlights during stops in the action.  In contrast to previous years, you can now get excellent cell service for calls and texting."

This place rocks.  They pat down; but, nothing like others.   This place is very, very nice.  Ticket shakedown every 25 yards - security on duty even after admittance - just to make sure one is on the right track.  One concern:  gotta keep the Dawgs from bitting.  Good luck with that..."

8670,Date of experience: October 2014,5-Oct-14,SEC,Georgia,4,Fun afternoon,"As a football fan but not a Georgia fan, I can say that Sanford is a fun place to go.Because it is an old college stadium the concourses are cramped cement walkways. If you are used to NFL stadiums where they are rebuilt every few years to suit the whims of the public, this isn't like that.The security is everywhere, and the red boxes behind the top row are especially irritating. They are manned to keep people from standing behind the back rows and they are serious about it.The concession stands are old and slow, the food is typically overpriced and not very good.Long lines for bathrooms, especially the women. Big surprise. At least the urinals are not troughs. Haha.So why a 4 rating? Heck, the game and atmosphere from the seats is why you are there!"

If not for the extreme inconvenience of too few concession stands and restrooms, this would be a higher rating.  But those long lines really do ruin a good day. Parking is at your own devices and seats are very narrow and uncomfortable.  So why do I love it?  It's Sanford Stadium!!!"

There is nothing like the quake the UGA fans create during a Bulldawg home game. First game of the 2014 has already proven what is yet to come."
8681,Date of experience: August 2014,2-Sep-14,SEC,Georgia,5,Massive now,"This place is massive now.  I attended my first UGA game in 1979.  We sat on the hill leading up to the (train) tracks at the then open end portion of the stadium.  It only cost $1 each to sit there.  You could bring all the alcohol you could carry to your seat back then.  Sanford Stadium only held 60-70 thousand people back then and was in the shape of a horseshoe.  Today, the stadium has long since claimed our $1 ""track"" seats as part of the multiple stadium renovation plans through the years.  Now the stadium is in line with many of the other mega stadiums of the SEC (UT, Auburn, Alabama, Florida, etc.), which is good I guess!  Change is inevitable!  Bigger, better, stronger, faster!  But if you drift back in time 35 years when things weren't quite so commercialized and made for massive TV rights contracts it wasn??t bad then either.  Things back then were actually fun!  There was no security, mostly because you didn't need any.  You didn't have to pay a month's salary to get 2 good seats from scalpers to see your favorite game.  You just went to the game and winged it!  Which is fine for 18-19 year old college students who had a thirst for beer and a distaste for overpriced game tickets.  $1 track seats leave a lot of money in the budget for more important things, like (pony keg) beer, to a young college student.  All that is decorations though!  What's important is what's down on the field.  The field at Sanford Stadium is still grass, and game is still played between the hedges and in from of all the departed UGA Dawg Mausoleums.  It's still my favorite football stadium!  No matter what they do to the outside!  Go Dawgs!"

They gave us the nosebleed seats.  I'm no spring chicken- so several flights of stairs was taxing.  Maybe they do that so you spend more on drinks.  The food is overpriced.  But, the experience is worth a Million!  I vote for an elevator or escalator."
8684,Date of experience: October 2013,10-Aug-14,SEC,Georgia,5,Great experience!,Home of the Dawgs...love Sanford Stadium and UGA.  The place is electric between the hedges!  Nothing like the experience and a lot of fun during rivalry weekends!  The only downside is the hotels in Athens gouge you during game day weekends if you stay overnight.
8685,Date of experience: November 2013,18-Jul-14,SEC,Georgia,5,Awesome stadium,There is nothing...and I mean NOTHING...like being in Sanford Stadium for a UGA home football game. The stadium is everything a college football stadium should be. I brought my son to his first game this year and he loved everything about this place.   We were able to come back the day after the game and walk around and see some things we couldn't see during the game.
8686,Date of experience: September 2013,14-Jul-14,SEC,Georgia,5,GA Football Between the Hedges,"Sanford Stadium is an awesome place to attend an SEC football game. The atmosphere is electric, especially when the Dogs are doing well. TV is no substitute for attendance at the live game. The high seats are a little ways from the field, but the giant screen and replays keep everyone up to date on the happenings. Every football fan needs to attend at least one SEC game at Sanford Stadium."

UGA's Sanford stadium is an intimidating place for players and fans of football alike, but a great place to watch college football on Saturdays. Views from the stands are good, and the atmosphere is exactly what you'd expect from SEC fans. However, the concessions are hard to access, and big games can be very crowded."

8694,Date of experience: November 2013,26-Nov-13,SEC,Georgia,4,Best Game Day Atmosphere,"There really isn't a bad seat in the place and we tried out a few at the Georgia-Kentucky game. Our tickets were actually in section 602, row 20 (you can't get any higher). We'd brought a friend who had never been to a Georgia game, so after the 1st quarter we moved down to the back of section 135 so he could hear the band better. Smart move. We were under the overhang, which provided relief from the chilly wind, the band sounded great and the players didn't look like ants. It's not the newest stadium, so the public areas are a little dingy, concession lines and restroom lines can be long. The area dedicated to Georgia's mascots of the past is quite touching and deserves a moment. If you can find a way in on non game days, that can be a treat too. We probably weren't supposed to be able to get in, but found an opening when my son was 3. We were able to walk around the track, touch the hedges and rub the concrete bulldog where the players take the field. It was pretty cool."
8695,Date of experience: November 2013,25-Nov-13,SEC,Georgia,5,Go Dawgs!!,"There is nothing like the home of the Georgia Bulldogs. If you never experienced a game on a crisp fall afternoon, it should be on your bucket list if even you are not a big football fan. The only downside for me is a few fans who might become over exuberant, usually due to alcohol consumption. You will almost certainly have a long walk before and after the game. It is the price you pay to cheer on the Dawgs with 92,000 of your closest friends."
8696,Date of experience: November 2013,24-Nov-13,SEC,Georgia,5,Best Football Stadium Anywhere,I'm a Georgia graduate so what would you expect me to say!  BUT it's true!! Beautiful campus and the stadium is the crown jewel of the university.

It is certainly quite an experience to see football played between the hedges. We sat in the upper deck, which was not a bad view at all. Only complaint is the lack of more concessions- lines were quite long on the upper concourse, so we had to walk down to the ground level to get food. Very friendly atmosphere!"
8698,Date of experience: October 2013,14-Oct-13,SEC,Georgia,5,Best Gameday Experience Ever,"I am unabashedly prejudiced. I love Sanford stadium and have attended games there for more than 40 years. The atmosphere is special and the game day traditions unite the fans with the team. If you ever have the chance, go to a game there regardless of the opponent. See first hand the leading religion in the south, college football."

8702,Date of experience: September 2013,1-Oct-13,SEC,Georgia,5,A Great College Football Experience,"Recently visited Sanford Stadium for UGA football game.  It was my first game there.  Highly recommend going to see a game there as you will be soaking in tradition and SEC football at its best.  This is what big time football and all its tradition is all about.  Facility is clean, spacious and full of Georgia spirit.  Really....the fans are good-natured and just in love with their dawgs.  They wear their colors proudly and abundantly.  For a great pre-game experience, make your way to 'the dog walk' to greet the players before the game as they unload the buses and make their way through the crowd giving high fives and receiving unparalleled cheers and admiration.  Quite an experience.The last section on each side (seating is a horseshoe shape) looks as if it might have limited view of the scoreboard, but we didn't sit there so I don't know for sure.  Did not make use of concessions as game was too exciting to miss.  Many picnics and tailgate parties going on beforehand, so we just brought a few sandwiches to eat beforehand.  No drinks allowed in the stadium.  Easy entry and exit into stadium and many gates to utilize.  Like any campus, parking is tough nearby but there were campus buses available and it's a beautiful enough campus to walk.  Yes, there are a lot of steps to the upper deck.  Truly a great college football experience"
8703,Date of experience: September 2013,30-Sep-13,SEC,Georgia,3,Long lines for concessions,"The stadium is okay, as is the view. The long concession lines made it impossible to get anything. The roving vendors only appeared in the 3rd quarter."

8705,Date of experience: September 2013,11-Sep-13,SEC,Georgia,4,"Good View, Bad Concessions!","My wife and I were at Sanford Stadium last weekend for the Georgia v. South Carolina game.  Carolina lost but I learned a long time ago that football is only a game and we lose some.  We arrived in Athens on a chartered tour bus so we did not have to drive or search for parking and we had a good time, overall.  Our seats were on row 19 of the top deck, right in the middle on the fifty yard line.  Our view was unobstructed and it looked as though the other seat had clear sight lines, as well.  The bathrooms were clean and there are escalators to get you to the 2nd and 3rd levels.  However, there were a bunch of steps to get to the top deck and my wife has a knee problem so that was difficult.  We could deal with that, though, as we expect to have long treks at a football stadium.  The only problem was the concession stands on the top deck -- there were only 2 and the lines were very long all day.  To top off the shortage of concession stands, the lines moved very slowly -- it took me 20 minutes to get a drink just before the end of the second quarter.  Its a nice stadium and there are well organized shuttle buses to and from the stadium but be prepared for the long waits to get food or drink if you are on the top level."

It's easy to get to and it's easy to locate your seat at the stadium. I also had the privilege of seeing Jason Aldean perform his first stadium concert at Sanford Stadium here!!! Go watch some awesome UGA football here when you get the chance!
8708,Date of experience: August 2013,13-Aug-13,SEC,Georgia,5,Best if visited in the Fall,Great viewing in the bowl arena of such Fall spectacles as the World Famous Georgia Bulldogs live up to their legendary feats. Visit on September 7th in your full Bulldog regalia and see South Carolina utterly destroyed by the Junkyard Dogs. Then return on September 21st to see the Dogs chew through North Texas. This event is only rivaled by the utter destruction of some kitty cats from LSU on September 28th. Then these chomping Dogs rip through Missouri leaving only the bones of the defeated. The Bulldogs again continue to maul their victims between the hedges with sacrificial lambs of Appalachian State on the 23rd then the annual skinning of the Kentucky wildkitties on the 23rd. All of these festivities lead to the final and main event in Athens with total humiliation and swatting of those pesky little Yellowflies from that trade school on North Avenue in Atlanta.
8709,Date of experience: October 2012,29-Jul-13,SEC,Georgia,5,Footbal Game,"We loved the stadium.  We have been to see games here on numerous occasions.

8711,Date of experience: November 2012,29-Jul-13,SEC,Georgia,5,There's nothing like a fall Saturday between the hedges!,"For the sake of transparency, I have to say up front that this review is completely biased.  I grew up in Athens, and I've spent countless fall Saturdays in Sanford Stadium cheering on my beloved Georgia Bulldogs.  Sanford Stadium is one of the top ten largest football stadiums in the US.  UGA football is steeped in tradition, as are many programs throughout the SEC.  I've had the opportunity to take guests to their first Georgia football game on many occasions--some were from out of state, some were from other countries, but they all thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  I've seen some reviews rate the food as mediocre, but honestly, if you're there for the food, you're there for the wrong reason.  There are many excellent restaurants in downtown Athens if you're looking for a good meal.  If, however, you're looking for a great football game with lots of deep-rooted tradition, Sanford Stadium is the place to be.  And just a warning:  if it's a big rivalry game, expect it to be rowdy...the Bulldog Nation prides itself on being loud and obnoxious, though as good southerners we do try to be polite.  Unless you're a Gator fan ;)"
8713,Date of experience: September 2012,21-May-13,SEC,Georgia,5,Aleways exceptional,The atmosphere here is second to none in the nation.  ANYONE who has the chance to go to Sanford Stadium for an event should make a real effort to do so.

I recommend attending at least one UGA game in your lifetime and do it at Sanford.   All my out of state friends I take to games have a great time.  You will not see anything like it in most areas of the USA.   PS--- I did PSU on Band Day in 1960s and season tickets in early 1970s and it was very good; UGA Sanford is well above that  experience - It's outstanding and an excellent day trip!
8723,Date of experience: November 2012,2-Feb-13,SEC,Georgia,4,Go DAWGS,"What a place to see a football came between the hedges.

8727,Date of experience: November 2012,20-Dec-12,SEC,Georgia,2,Safety Concerns,"Beautiful stadium, but the upper levels have little to no safety devices (adequate handrails, etc) on the upper decks. I'm wearing an aircast and had to climb to the very top row of the stadium to get to my seat. I've never had an issue with heights, but by the time I got to my seat I was physically ill. Could not enjoy the game much because I kept feeling like I or someone around me was going to fall and never stop til they splatted on the field hundreds of feet below! The only way I will EVER go back, is to ensure I have a seat in the lower section of the stadium. A friend of mine that was with me has respiratory problems, she was short of breath and ill by the time we got to our seats as well. There are no provisions for persons with ambulatory issues except an elevator in one far corner of the stadium...you literally have to walk about a mile to get to it. Then the elevator will only take you to the base of the tier. One of the ushers had to carry our concessions up to the top of the stadium for me because I couldn't focus on getting up all the stairs and balancing that too. Just not a good venue for people with medical issues and not enough warning to let you know in advance to request specific seating. The field is beautiful and so is the rest of the stadium, but no more climbing for me!"

It never felt like I was in a crowd of 92,000 fans.The stadium does a great job with the scoreboard, even showing live cut-ins and highlights of other games before the UGA game and during timeouts.I liked that there is no parking directly around the stadium.  The flow of the crowd emptied very easily after the game.  We parked downtown in a parking deck and had no problems quickly getting out of the deck and on the highway back to Atlanta."

8740,Date of experience: September 2012,28-Sep-12,SEC,Georgia,5,GO DAWGS!!,"If you love UGA football, then you love Sanford Stadium!!  There isn't a bad seat in the entire stadium!"
8742,Date of experience: September 2012,21-Sep-12,SEC,Georgia,3,lousy sound system colors game,"This review could get me shot, as there are those here in Athens that worship at Sanford far more devoutly than church, however in my first experience there I was incredibly underwhelmed. Being a big college football fan, I like the whole experience. I was on the first upper deck, (not the high one), down low, near the 50 yard line. I never heard a thing over the speakers, which sounded like they were only coming from the scoreboard. Nice scoreboard, btw. I would have liked to have seen scores from other schools outside the SEC. Rest of the stadium seemed fine, and I liked the ample room inbetween my bleacher and the person in front of me. You can't blame the stadium for the crazy perky/high/drunk freshman girl in front of me, but that added to the experience for sure."
8743,Date of experience: September 2012,8-Sep-12,SEC,Georgia,5,The quintessential college football experience,"Awesome experience everyone in the south should have at least once. Excellent tailgating, passionate fans, and immersion in the SEC experience.  Great location in the middle of campus across from the bookstore where you can buy a little something to remember your trip."
8745,Date of experience: October 2011,23-Aug-12,SEC,Georgia,5,What can I say,If your thinking about going here its for a game. A MUST DO! Parking is horrible but that is to be expected. Just arrive early. Sometimes its just worth the $10 parking ticket.
8747,Date of experience: October 2011,11-Aug-12,SEC,Georgia,5,UGA,Home of the UGA Bulldogs.  There are few things in life that compare to the feeling of rooting on the dawgs (as we say around here) with 98k of your fellow football enthusiasts.
8748,Date of experience: August 2011,23-Jul-12,SEC,Georgia,4,Game day!,"Great stadium for college football and to cheer on UGA Dawgs. It does have very small allocated seating, which is fine for slim students but a bit tighter for larger people. There is also no shade whatsoever in any of the stadium apart from the far side, and the drinks are very expensive. All part of Saturday football though to be honest and it's still a great day out. Shuttle buses to and from the stadium are great and I would agree with another reviewer about the steep stairs - be very careful!"
8749,Date of experience: October 2011,17-Jul-12,SEC,Georgia,5,Excellent stadium to watch college football,"This is one of the great places in America to watch a college football game.  I have been to 11 of the 12 SEC stadiums, and this is one of the best atmosphere's for a big game.  Pretty girls, great tailgaiting, and nothing better than the Red and Black putting a good ole fashioned whooping on a team."
8754,Date of experience: October 2011,4-May-12,SEC,Georgia,4,"If you like hanging out with 90,000 of your closest friends....","...then this is the place for you.  Game weekends in Athens are packed, so come prepared for fun, food, people, and adult beverages.   I'm to the age that crowds lack the appeal they had when I was a youth, but the experience of watching a game in Sanford wonk't soon be forgotten."
8755,Date of experience: October 2011,30-Apr-12,SEC,Georgia,5,Go Dawgs!,Best atmosphere ever! Sit on the South end to avoid some sun exposure/get to sit in the shade for part of the game!
8762,Date of experience: November 2011,14-Feb-12,SEC,Georgia,5,What's not to like??,Sanford Stadium is the best place on the planet to watch the best team in the SEC play!!  LOVE IT!
8763,Date of experience: November 2011,4-Feb-12,SEC,Georgia,5,"90,000+",Great venue to watch a football game.  Even at the upper level not a bad view of the game.
8768,Date of experience: November 2011,14-Jan-12,SEC,Georgia,5,Saturday's in Athens are Awesome!!,"This is truly one of the most beautiful stadiums in all of college football.  The hedges are very unique and the statues of UGA are wonderful.  It is a very fan friendly place:  easy to find your seat and good visibility.  Sometimes the bathrooms are not clean or serviced, and sometimes the lines for the bathrooms are too long but that is to be expected.  The concession stands are not as efficient as they might be, but the drink stands are helpful to get you back to your seat fast!"
8770,Date of experience: November 2011,1-Jan-12,SEC,Georgia,5,Home of the GA Bulldogs,"Sanford Stadium is a magnet for the GA Bulldog fan. It is a huge (holds close to 90,000 fans) and historic stadium where the Bulldogs play between the hedges. It is an Athens must see. Legendary and historic. The Bulldog Nation was birthed and still lives on at Sanford Stadium."
8771,Date of experience: November 2011,24-Dec-11,SEC,Georgia,3,Its just a stadium.,Its just a stadium with VIP seatings and costly to attend.
8772,Date of experience: December 2011,13-Dec-11,SEC,Georgia,5,Home of the Dawgs...,"My most recent trip to Sanford was actually to attend Larry Munson's memorial service.  There could not have been a more perfect backdrop for his send off.  I've been to Sanford Stadium too many times to possibly count.  Is there a better college football stadium in the nation?!?  I think not!  That's the review in a nutshell.  There is nothing like game day in Athens and cheering on the Dawgs between the hedges with 80,000+ of your closest friends.  Glory, glory to 'ole Georgia!"
8773,Date of experience: December 2010,27-Nov-11,SEC,Georgia,5,GO DAWGS!,"Seriously...this is the best stadium on earth. They keep it clean, it's located in the beautiful Athens, GA and it's the home of the Ga Bulldogs! Need I say more?"

8778,Date of experience: November 2021,14-Nov-21,SEC,Alabama,5,A darn good time!  Roll Tide!,"If you can get North Zone seats, do it.  They feed you incredibly well and the seats are quite comfortable.  Alabama does an excellent job of running their game day operations all over campus.  The parking is well executed and there is a lot of stuff to do all over campus."
8779,Date of experience: November 2021,14-Nov-21,SEC,Alabama,5,Awesome and breathtaking,This place was breath taking. But all of the staff we had contact with were extremely helpful. Some more signs could be put up to help with directions but other than that it was great!
8780,Date of experience: October 2021,25-Oct-21,SEC,Alabama,5,Family Fun,Had a great time exploring the stadium.   We enjoyed seeing the statues of all of the head coaches and enjoyed going down the walk of fame that displays all the national championship titles along the pathway leading up to the stadium.
8781,Date of experience: October 2021,17-Oct-21,SEC,Alabama,5,Walked by Iconic Stadium.,My Wife attended The University of Alabama in the 1970s.  She was very excited to return to see the Campus. And she bought Hot Chocolate at the Starbuck next to the Stadium.  What was best.  Her campus dorm is still being occupied 2021.  How cool.
8782,Date of experience: October 2021,2-Oct-21,SEC,Alabama,1,Extraordinarily uncomfortable,Had to move from seats I loved to section F this year since UA decided they could squeeze more dollars out of U2 west side. Section Fs leg room is intolerable with the seat backs. I??ll never sit in these seats again was in pain after two quarters and wasted thousands on season tickets. Better have some short people on the waiting list Tide Pride. Attached photo is legroom for my 5??1 wife. I??m 6??2??.
8783,Date of experience: September 2021,13-Sep-21,SEC,Alabama,5,Fantastic Experience,"This was my first college football game I attended. I was really impressed by the passion of the fans and the legacy of the program. The whole town just gets transformed as 100,000 plus all have their special game day rituals that start hours before kickoff. The stadium is huge yet it seemed to be easy to catch all the action even in the upper deck. It??s an experience you??ll never forget!"
8784,Date of experience: September 2021,12-Sep-21,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide!,It was great to come back and see the stadium after numerous years of being away.   The best part is the home team.
8785,Date of experience: August 2021,5-Sep-21,SEC,Alabama,5,Amazing in person!,The stadium is so big in person!  It is easy to access and is right in the middle of hotels and restaurants.  Add this to your must do list!
8786,Date of experience: October 2020,1-May-21,SEC,Alabama,5,Simply awesome,"Every game at this place is awesome.  Even if Bama is blowing out the other team, they keep you entertained.  It can be very hot though so if you go to a game in September I recommend seats on the home side for more shade."

8789,Date of experience: November 2019,11-Sep-20,SEC,Alabama,5,Great experience!,"Been here many times. Always a great place to visit. The walk from your car could potentially be a long walk unless you want to pay to park closer, we never do. The atmosphere is amazing especially if you are an Alabama fan. Lots of places to buy souvenirs. Inside the food and drinks are rather expensive but I guess that is all part of it. We will go back over and over again. Love it!"
8792,Date of experience: October 2019,18-Feb-20,SEC,Alabama,5,First Timer,"October 2019, went to Arkansas game. Very pleased with most everything. The elevator line was very long and it was a fairly long walk for me. Although we had good seats fairl close to the President I would??ve loved to met Mr. Donald Trump."
8793,Date of experience: September 2019,21-Jan-20,SEC,Alabama,5,First Alabama Game,"My first Alabama game was awesome! It was extremely hot, but there were misting fans and huge coolers of cold water throughout the stadium which was nice. Loved it!!"
8794,Date of experience: September 2019,1-Jan-20,SEC,Alabama,5,Best place on the planet!,"I am totally biased here, but ROLL TIDE ROLL! There is not a stadium that I have been to in this country that captures my spirit quite like Bryant Denny. It is always like coming home. A little disappointed that we are losing some of the best seats in the place to the higher paying boxes, but still my favorite place!"
8795,Date of experience: November 2019,9-Dec-19,SEC,Alabama,5,Impressive,"Nothing compares to seeing Alabama play on their home field. Just note there is construction nearby, but that should finish before the next season. Plenty of parking and wide sidewalks for walking to the stadium. Be sure to visit Paul Bryant Museum for history of Alabama football when in town for a game."
8796,Date of experience: November 2019,23-Nov-19,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide!,This stadium is perfect! The Alabama Crimson Tide plays here so how could it not be perfect! Day or might it??s fun and functional.
8797,Date of experience: November 2019,16-Nov-19,SEC,Alabama,5,"101,821","Came fo the first time for the Alabama - LSU game.  Awesome venue with a capacity of 101,821.  Easy in/easy out, great sight lines, convenient concessions and restrooms.  The seats were a little tight for my 6'6"" frame but otherwise, no complaints.  We saw a fantastic game even though the Tide lost.  Should be on every college football fans bucket list."
8798,Date of experience: September 2019,11-Nov-19,SEC,Alabama,5,Worth every penny,We came the bama ole miss game from CT. The stadium blew us away! The size the people everything was great. The people working here were so friendly and they bleed crimson for their bama team. We will absolutely be coming back for more games! ROLLTIDE.
8799,Date of experience: October 2019,28-Oct-19,SEC,Alabama,5,Bryant Denny stadium,Visited for the first time during homecoming game against Arkansas.  Beautiful stadium. Tickets in lower bowl allow you to walk in an area on the field behind the benches. Only drawback are seats are close together (small)
8800,Date of experience: October 2019,28-Oct-19,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide,"A must see, if theirs a better place in the country to see a game I want to know!Great stadium, atmosphere,tradition,sound and lights were incredible ohh yea Bama won 48-7.  Family friendly :)"
8801,Date of experience: October 2019,28-Oct-19,SEC,Alabama,5,RTR - Great Time,Loved our 1st game at Bryant Denny Stadium. We sat in the upper level around the 30 yard line. The view of the field was excellent. Loved the band and the light show. Can??t wait to come back.
8802,Date of experience: October 2019,23-Oct-19,SEC,Alabama,2,Sadly disappointing,"I take one college football road trip with a buddy each year. Having been to U of MN, U of WI, Purdue, Ok State, U of Neb, Notre Dame & U of MI, we thought we??d kick it up and travel to U of A (vs TN). Let me preface by saying that we wear a shirt of our hometown team as to make all aware that we have no allegiance to either of the teams playing. Tuscaloosa has a beautiful, quant downtown and a campus that is 2nd only to ND in beauty. Bryant-Denny Stadium: + Very nice visually, great sight lines for viewing. - concession lines block the narrow corridors making passage difficult. The much hyped light show was simply a techie working a dimmer switch. PreGame: + nothing. - We walked the tailgate area for an hour pregame and were never addressed, approached or welcomed. - Campus bars were snooze fest. Take away: Bama fans are self impressed, aloof & pretentious. Southern Charm is a myth. Here??s hoping our LSU experience in 2020 is more enjoyable."
8803,Date of experience: October 2019,20-Oct-19,SEC,Alabama,5,Game Night,"Went to watch Alabama vs. Tennessee.  Was not disappointed.  This is an amazing  venue.  As a Tide fan,its Mecca.Pros:Not a bad seat in the house.Large LED screens.New LED lighting, roll tide red, first time used... Amazing.Cons:Not ManyReally, just love the stadium and design."
8804,Date of experience: October 2019,20-Oct-19,SEC,Alabama,5,Tennessee-Alabama football game,There was an adequate amount of seat space and leg room. The concessions had a good variety to choose from and were reasonably priced. The stadium looked upgraded and modern. The four Jumbotrons were nice and very convenient for viewing.
8805,Date of experience: October 2019,20-Oct-19,SEC,Alabama,5,1st Alabama Game,Roll Tide!!  We had such a great time at the UT vs. Bama game!  The stadium is beautiful and the new light show was amazing. Great view from all seats! Clean bathrooms!!!
8806,Date of experience: September 2019,2-Oct-19,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide Roll!,"If you haven't ever been to a college football game, this is the one for you. There is nothing like sharing a Saturday afternoon with 101,000 of your best friends.  The stadium employees are very hospitable and there isn't a bad seat in the stadium. Arrive early and enjoy all of the pregame festivities."
8807,Date of experience: September 2019,23-Sep-19,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide,We gave our son tickets to a Bama game for his 9th birthday & made a whole weekend out of it! The stadium was clean & had an easy layout. Staff was friendly & helpful!

8810,Date of experience: September 2019,22-Sep-19,SEC,Alabama,4,Roll Tide,Great place for college game!  Hot - so hydrate and be prepared.  West side gets shade first.  Don??t forget to stop by the Walk of Champions about 2 hours before the game
8811,Date of experience: September 2019,16-Sep-19,SEC,Alabama,4,Lock box,"I was charged for safe without sking up front if I needed one. Hotel sits in the middle of the campus. My walk to my class was less than 3 minutes and the Bear Bryant museum was less than 5 minutes walking. If you are there for the University of Alabamaa, it is the place to stay."
8812,Date of experience: August 2019,4-Sep-19,SEC,Alabama,5,This Stadium is The Best,"The atmosphere during the game is nothing that you have ever felt in your life. And this year, the new LED lighting system is going to blow everyone's minds! I've been to a few places for all kinds of sports events but Tuscaloosa has some of the greatest fans, amenities, and hospitality that I have ever seen. Go to a game if your in town."
8813,Date of experience: September 2018,17-Aug-19,SEC,Alabama,5,Unbelievable,You have never seen a more well oiled machine to get people in and out of town in game days.   This is one of the biggest stadiums in the US.  Use joy ride _ small golf cart transportation!
8815,Date of experience: August 2019,7-Aug-19,SEC,Alabama,4,Nice big stadium outside,"I drove by to see it while in town on business. It is in a nice area with lots of trees around. Curious to see on old cemetery right across the street. Maybe Bear Bryant is buried there, and lot of Alabama football foes? Tuscaloosa roads and sidewalks are all tore up at the moment so it takes a lot longer to get there than normal. Looks like the roads are under engineered for the amount of traffic so they might be fixing that."
8818,Date of experience: January 2019,5-Jun-19,SEC,Alabama,5,Sporting event,Easy access for Handicap. Very nice place to visit in the Campus of the University of Alabama. Top Notch Facility
8819,Date of experience: September 2018,5-Jun-19,SEC,Alabama,5,Watched football game,We went into the zone had a very nice meal enjoyed the game. The staff there were very accommodating super friendly.
8821,Date of experience: November 2018,7-May-19,SEC,Alabama,5,The best place in the city,"ROLL TIDE! If you want to see a top notch team play in a top notch stadium, Bryant-Denny Stadium does not disappoint. Food is wonderful and decently priced. Seating options are pretty good. There are elevators for those in need of disability assistance. The crowds are exciting and welcoming to the guest team."
8826,Date of experience: September 2018,19-Mar-19,SEC,Alabama,5,Deserving of a National Championship Team,This awe-inspiring facility is not just home to the multiple national champion Crimson Tide but a source of pride for the student body.  It's massive presence does not overwhelm football fans and there is not a bad seat in the house...even at the highest level.  School pride inside and out.
8827,Date of experience: November 2018,19-Mar-19,SEC,Alabama,5,Love this place on home game days!,"There is nothing quite like Bryant-Denny Stadium on home game days!  Highly recommend!!!  Roll Tide, y'all!!!"
8829,Date of experience: August 2018,4-Mar-19,SEC,Alabama,5,"Great place for a game, and incredible energy when the team comes out!","Super fun day! To avoid delays, make sure you follow the rules,  (take a clear bag, no umbrellas, and so forth). Review your ticket. Go an hour or two early and visit the quad and then be in your seat at least 20 or 30 minutes before kick off. Rent a stadium seat if you are on a bleacher to be comfortable and to protect your seat space in case it is a capacity crowd.  Then enjoy the energy!  It is incredible. You can save some money by purchasing one water and then refiling the bottle. It is a memory you will keep for years every time you go."
8830,Date of experience: November 2018,3-Mar-19,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide Roll!,I don??t know what more you can really say about Bryant Denny Stadium. This is the scene. This is the site. This is where it all goes down. The stadium is in really great shape and an upcoming renovation promises to make it even nicer. The vendors serve everything from dreamland BBQ to your basic hotdog. And Coca-Cola is everywhere ?? no Pepsi here?? It??s kind of a shame that we only use it for football.
8831,Date of experience: November 2018,12-Feb-19,SEC,Alabama,4,Alabama football game,Enjoyed Chick-fil-A at the Alabama vs Auburn Football game!  Food was great and ballgame even better!
8833,Date of experience: November 2018,22-Dec-18,SEC,Alabama,5,Came here to See The Crimson Tide Play,"at 66 ,Ive been to many stadium venues ,but quite honestly this was absolutely the best experience Ive ever had hands down. The place was spotless before ,during and after the game ,restrooms ,floors everything . The vendors and security were most helpful, and made the experience one for the record books. We will be back ,and in fact planning my trips here for next year right now."
8834,Date of experience: September 2018,17-Dec-18,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide Roll!,"Being an Alabama fan, I feel as this review will contain nothing but biased information. Bryant Denny Stadium is the best place on earth. I've seen many football stadiums but no other atmosphere compares to the electrifying atmospheres on earth. The setup on the stadium is setup very neatly for the average fan. There's the Quad and the Walk of Champions. I recommend this place to anyone."
8835,Date of experience: December 2018,10-Dec-18,SEC,Alabama,5,Love it,Always a very good experience. Like the new added security. The atmosphere is electrifying.  Seating is good.  Can??t wait to go back.  Eat at the blue moon.   It is great
8836,Date of experience: November 2018,4-Dec-18,SEC,Alabama,5,2018 Iron Bowl,We attended the 2018 Iron Bowl and witnessed the Crimson Tide beat the Tigers.  How incredibly exciting to be in that stadium with SO much excitement.  It was AWESOME!!!  Roll Tide!!!
8837,Date of experience: November 2018,28-Nov-18,SEC,Alabama,5,Iron Bowl - Roll Tide!,"Not really what i expected, very impressive stadium, fans, tailgating and city around the stadium. We arrived into town around 10am for a 2:30pm game, walked the quad, grabbed a few beers, picked up a flask from JT's market and rolled in a few minutes before game time. We were in the super nose bleed section PP, which the security line took about 20 minutes to get in and then you walk in a spiral walk way(think of a giant corkscrew) for another 10 minutes to wind your way up to the upper deck. Our seats were snug but eventually opened up. The view of the game up here was pretty solid, you didn't feel very far away, the only downside was the sun was in our eyes for the first half, wish i would have brought a hat. If I went again, i would get tickets on the other side of the stadium, I also bought them on Stub hub for about $275, but it seemed like you could pick them up pretty easily on the streets for less. The ""walk of champions"" was at 12:30 for this game and the statues out front were pretty cool. Considering the population of Tuscaloosa is 100k, and the stadium holds a 100k, plus there were at least another 100k people in the bars, tailgate and around the stadium, it's an understatement to say this is the biggest show in the state on game day. I would recommend this for any football fan! If you are into drinking games, I would not recommend trying to take a drink every time the crowd says ""Roll Tide""."
8838,Date of experience: November 2018,26-Nov-18,SEC,Alabama,5,Beautiful campus and Stadium,"A beautiful day, perfect for a football game. The stadium was clean and the staff did an amazing job moving a lot of people through quickly. And FREE Pom poms!!!"
8839,Date of experience: November 2018,25-Nov-18,SEC,Alabama,5,Best gameday environment,I'm biased but Bryant Denny and the Alabama campus has the best gameday environment there is. We come to 1 or 2 games a year and its always a good time
8840,Date of experience: September 2018,24-Nov-18,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide!,There's no better place to catch an Alabama game.  It's best to make an event out of your visit including tailgating on the Quad and making the short walk over to the stadium.  When visiting during hot weather choose your side carefully as you'll want the sun at your back and be in the shade.  There are water stations inside as well which helps you beat the heat.  Good tickets are hard to come by but high end zone seats are usually available for most games if you watch your timing.  There's plenty of parking around campus with a free and easy to use shuttle bus system.
8841,Date of experience: October 2018,24-Nov-18,SEC,Alabama,5,Great experience,"The loudest stadium i've ever been in - people were friendly, easy to get in and out - was a terrific college football experience"
8842,Date of experience: November 2018,18-Nov-18,SEC,Alabama,5,What a treat!,"We were here for the Citadel game--what a great first half, right???--and the atmosphere is amazing. Everyone was so friendly ( of course, if we had been from Auburn I might not be saying that!). Very family friendly pre-game activities and even though there was a large crowd, they have crowd control down to a science. If you have the opportunity to attend an Alabama game don't pass it up."
8843,Date of experience: November 2018,17-Nov-18,SEC,Alabama,5,Bama vs Citadel,"Not a sold out game , but fun to experience the RollTide phenomenon. Older structure , reasonable prices for basic snacks. Metal detector lines went very quickly. Well organized getting people in and out."
8844,Date of experience: November 2018,17-Nov-18,SEC,Alabama,4,Huge!,Very big amazing stadium. This is the place to really revel in the electricity of the crowd.  Football is king here
8846,Date of experience: November 2018,12-Nov-18,SEC,Alabama,5,Game day,My wife and I have been to several games here.  Great place to watch the Tide roll.  I suggest sitting on home side especially when it is warm outside.

8851,Date of experience: September 2018,20-Oct-18,SEC,Alabama,5,Bryant Denny Stadium,"Our visit to Bryant-Denny Stadium was absolutely awesome. WE especially needed assistance due to our physical issues and I was having Surgery on Monday. We found out their ADA assistance program at Bryant Denney was stellar. First, we had to of course be cleared documentation has to be given to obtain this wonderful service from Bryant Denney.We paid a small fee for parking which had school buses arriving back and forth to assist with folks with disabilities. Our experience was stellar. Every College should shadow Bryant Denny Stadium ADA policy it really takes care of folks who have impairments. Oh and if you feel you cannot come to a game cause you are disabled please Alabama folks will take care of you!!!"
8852,Date of experience: October 2018,20-Oct-18,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide Roll,"Me and my dad are HUGE Bama fans, and we go here a lot during football season. It is so good there! The food is great.

8853,Date of experience: October 2018,17-Oct-18,SEC,Alabama,3,Nice Stadium,This is a very nice stadium compared to most college stadiums.  The level of play inside and the gamely experience is what sets this place apart.Be sure to check out the coach statues outside the stadium on your visit.
8854,Date of experience: October 2018,16-Oct-18,SEC,Alabama,5,Game Night,Great venue.  Bama fans are first class.  Our seats were at the very top.  But the view was fantastic.  Their fans treat you well and they know how to have a great time!

8856,Date of experience: September 2018,15-Oct-18,SEC,Alabama,1,Running out of food!,"I enjoy the Bryant Denny concessions but every game this year (2018), they are running out of food. This is very unsatisfactory. The football team brings in too much money to have this issue. I'm not sure if it's the new contract with the food servicing company but something has got to give!"
8857,Date of experience: October 2018,7-Oct-18,SEC,Alabama,4,College visit to Alabama,Came to Alabam for a college visit and stopped by to check out the stadium. It is massive! Very nice entrance with plaques on the ground of the championships and statues of former coaches. A neat place to see.
8858,Date of experience: September 2018,4-Oct-18,SEC,Alabama,4,Beautiful Stadium,"The stadium is beautiful and the grounds around the stadium and campus are gorgeous. Really not a bad seat in the stadium. My only complaint is with as many this stadium can hold, there definitely are not enough concession stands open. Not fun taking a 7 year old and waiting over 30 minutes in line for food."
8859,Date of experience: September 2018,3-Oct-18,SEC,Alabama,5,Bama game,"great staduim, great fans 9n campus venue is topclass. glad we made the trip to Tuscaloosa with friends. stayed in RV. Easy access to campus"

8864,Date of experience: September 2018,22-Sep-18,SEC,Alabama,4,Came for Football game,Really enjoyed seeing a game here. They have a lot of food choices.  The bench seats can become uncomfortable. They do offer a chair to rent that has a back that attaches to the bench seats.

Beautiful stadium! Fun to enjoy the fan's loyalty and enthusiasm for their team! Beware! Arrive early as parking is a Bear (Bryant!)"
8866,Date of experience: September 2018,17-Sep-18,SEC,Alabama,4,Top venue - be selective,"This is one of the top college atmospheres in the US. The facilities are updated with adequate concessions and restrooms. If it??s an early season game, expect the temperature to be high and if your seats are in the south or east sides of the stadium, wear sunscreen. You??ll be in direct sunlight. Of course, late in the season when the temps drop, south and west are good. Don??t miss an opportunity to see a game here - just know what to expect based on your seats and the weather."
8867,Date of experience: September 2018,11-Sep-18,SEC,Alabama,4,First every ball game,"Went up to visit the kid and took in a game.  Very nice stadium, even though we had high up seats the walk up was gradual.  Very pretty arena."

It's open air, this is the South, so it can get HOT. Its a long walk to the top but they do have shuttles that can take you up. Just leave extra time cause they are moving as fast as they can but the lines can be long. This is a MUST SEE for any Bama fan!! If not a fan when you get there, you will be when you leave!!!"
8870,Date of experience: September 2018,10-Sep-18,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide!!!,Always awesome to see the Tide Roll. Took my granddaughter for first game and had a great time. Only complaint was that it was a early game and it was HOT!!

The atmosphere is unreal. 100,000 plus friends cheering as loud as they can for their team. I say friends because you walk in sitting around strangers but before you leave you??ve high fived everyone in your radius.

The jumbo video screens help to review the amazing plays!! Restrooms are clean!! If not in town for a game, and it's midweek, before you arrive, check to see if stadium tours are being offered. The behind the scenes view of the locker room, a suite and other areas are worth the very small fee."
8889,Date of experience: January 2018,28-Jan-18,SEC,Alabama,5,Championship Parade,"We were in town on Jan. 20, 2018 for Alabama's Championship Parade. Bryant Denny Stadium is one of the most eye catching sights on campus. What an amazing time we had. The grounds were well kept. The yard was clean and groomed, as well. The stadium itself is absolutely gorgeous. Its massive appearance is breathtaking. All the statues are just lovely. We will most definitely be visiting again in the future."
8890,Date of experience: October 2017,24-Jan-18,SEC,Alabama,5,ROLL TIDE,Was able to see my first Bama home game against Tennessee. Great stadium with great atmosphere and such history.
8891,Date of experience: January 2018,22-Jan-18,SEC,Alabama,5,Home of the National Champions,When in Tuscaloosa you must go by and see the stadium of the National Champions.  You may not be able to go in but just to walk around it is cool.  Surrounded by college life you can't miss it.  The statues of the great coaches that have taken Alabama where no other college team has gone.
8892,Date of experience: November 2017,21-Jan-18,SEC,Alabama,4,Great venue for football.,"Outstanding venue for football. The ribbon board is fantastic along with the video boards. Concessions could be better, but overall a great experience."

8894,Date of experience: January 2018,4-Jan-18,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide!,"No true Bama fan would dare say a bad word about Bryant-Denny. It's a landmark. Our trademark. The home of the Crimson Tide!But, I will note that the parking, nrw rules about what and how you can bring things in, and the no alcohol policy are pretty annoying. I think those could be improved, but the stadium itself is what T-town is all about. Roll Tide."
8895,Date of experience: October 2017,20-Dec-17,SEC,Alabama,2,Too Expensive,"The food is way too expensive but what can you expect for a multi million dollar ""business""?  Had a hamburger and fries and what a joke on price and $5 for a water I can buy for $0.25 each at Wal Mart?"
8897,Date of experience: November 2017,23-Nov-17,SEC,Alabama,5,Our first game.,"We did have to park a little distance from the stadium, however when we saw the stadium it was amazing. The stairs on the other hand, not so good."
8898,Date of experience: November 2017,20-Nov-17,SEC,Alabama,5,Great gameday atmosphere,"Visited several times this year for games and once for a tour through the university.

8899,Date of experience: October 2017,15-Nov-17,SEC,Alabama,5,OUT OF THIS WORLD EXPERIENCE TO GET TO GO TO AN ALABAMA GAME IT IS A MUST!,I went to my first alabama game this year and I absolutely loved it! I went to Southern Miss in MS for undergrad and my husband attends UA Law now. I always wanted to go to a alabama game so my friend took me to homecoming. It is an experience I would tell anyone to have once in their lives. My breath was taken away from all the energy and vibes of alabama fans and just seeing a stadium that big up close and personal was mesmerizing!
8900,Date of experience: November 2017,13-Nov-17,SEC,Alabama,5,GAME DAY,"Good experience! Love the Shuttle Buses Pretty well organized. Love all the pre game hoopla. Pretty tight seating.

8902,Date of experience: October 2017,10-Nov-17,SEC,Alabama,5,Simply Amazing!,"This facility is just awesome. It was VERY clean. In fact, they were still cleaning up from Saturday's game on Monday. Every seat is a great seat. I highly recommend taking the tour. It's really cool to see all the different rooms in the facility, hear the history and the stories. A must for any football fan. ROLL TIDE!"
8903,Date of experience: November 2017,8-Nov-17,SEC,Alabama,5,Best Stadium EVER!,"?? ?? Roll Tide Ya'll !    Bryant Denny under the lights is awesome , especially if you're cheering for The Tide !Restrooms were pretty clean considering the # of patrons .   We happened to be there on a night when some Specia Forces in the Military dropped in via Parachute !   God Bless The USA & Bryant Denny Stadium !"
8904,Date of experience: November 2017,5-Nov-17,SEC,Alabama,4,Roll Tide!,"Came for the Alabama/LSU game. Good experience!  Pretty well organized. Like going to a fair with all the pre game hoopla. Pretty tight seating. And as expected, very loud. Easy access to food, drink and toilets. Beautiful campus.  Zoe??s at the stadium was a great find for good chow with seating before the game."
8905,Date of experience: November 2017,1-Nov-17,SEC,Alabama,5,What's not to love....,"Bryant Denny is the best place to watch a game. Always fun. Depending on your seats, you may get crowded in. Just a fun experience to see the Tide play!"
8906,Date of experience: October 2017,23-Oct-17,SEC,Alabama,5,Outstanding,We attended the Alabama vs Tennessee game and had a great experience. Facilities were very well kept and easily accessible.  Great environment for enjoying the game.
8907,Date of experience: October 2017,22-Oct-17,SEC,Alabama,5,VOL Fan Gives It A Thumbs Up!,"Here??s an honest review from a fan that just watched her team get their pants beat off! We??ve been to this stadium twice this year, and I??ve been to MANY other stadiums across the country. This one is top notch! The people have been exceptionally friendly and courteous, and they do a superior job with crowd control. The views seem to be good from wherever you are, however nosebleed will always be nosebleed. Ladies plan on bringing a clear purse to expedite entry. If you ever get an opportunity to get tickets in ??The Zone?? DO IT! The service and food is top notch! The stadium is very accommodating to handicap needs."
8908,Date of experience: October 2017,17-Oct-17,SEC,Alabama,5,Homecoming 2017,"Always enjoy being in Tuscaloosa and on campus for homecoming. Activities for all ages, and no better venue for a Roll Tide Roll homecoming win."
8909,Date of experience: October 2017,16-Oct-17,SEC,Alabama,5,"Fall is Spectacular at Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, AL","As season ticket holders for close to 30 years and being an Alabama graduate, there is no place like a football game at Bryant-Denny Stadium. 102,000+ fans pack the stadium for every game. Of course, it doesn't hurt to have the Number One team, coach, and supporters in the USA. The campus is magnificent and everyone should visit The Bryant Museum, the Quad or just stroll around before heading to the stadium. With security tight across the USA, B-D is no exception. Ladies leave those big purses & bags in your car or at home. You will have to put everything in clear bags to pass through the security checkpoints. If you have never attended an Alabama game, start practicing yelling ""Roll Tide"". You will fit right in."
8910,Date of experience: September 2017,15-Oct-17,SEC,Alabama,5,Not a bad seat anywhere.,"After a day of touring campus and admissions meetings, my son, a buddy and I enjoyed witnessing one of the greatest spectacles in sports.  Alabama makes tailgating an art form.  Tents everywhere on the quad, a family-friendly tailgate area, a vibrant downtown strip and the frats blasting great live music everywhere.  We enjoyed lying on the front lawn of the stadium, near the Walk of Champions, and seeing the busses pull up with the team for their walk into the stadium.  Inside the stadium, the atmosphere is electric.  Even in a 66-3 blowout of Ole Miss, we had a blast.  I am so hoping my son goes to Mama.  I want to experience more of this!"
8911,Date of experience: October 2017,15-Oct-17,SEC,Alabama,5,The Greatest College Football Stadium,"Admittedly, I am biased having gone to UA.  However, it is a wonderful experience to take part in game day in Tuscaloosa.  As with most, if not all, of the major college football programs, Bryant-Denny has undergone extensive expansion and renovations over the past 20 years and improvements are a continuous process.  This had made the stadium very accessible, accommodating and provides fans with a total immersion experience for games.  In addition, the atmosphere surrounding the stadium is always great.  If you have the opportunity, go see a game a Bryant Denny. Roll Tide!"
8912,Date of experience: October 2017,15-Oct-17,SEC,Alabama,4,Great place to spend a Saturday,I really enjoy being in the stadium. During game time the crowd is really a part of the game and it is generally a very enjoyable experience. Most of the concessions are kind of what you'd expect at a college stadium
8913,Date of experience: October 2017,14-Oct-17,SEC,Alabama,1,Terrible parking for handicap,"I had tickets that cost over $300 for a game that my wife had to give away because we couldn't part close enough to roll my wheelchair iinto the stadium.  Three of four handicap parking areas is completely full for the rest of 2017, and the fourth area indicated it was full prior to the start of the game, but I was told that I might get in if I showed up 3 hours early.  I have neck and spine problems and cannot sit in a chair for 3-4 hours for the game plus another 3 hours waiting on the game plus another hour to get from the car to the stadium.  The stadium should be sued for noncompliance with the spirit and intent of the ADA, but when the demand is so much greater than the supply of seats, apparently no one is in charge of trying to help handicap people get into the game.  I ended up sitting in a hotel and my wife gave my ticket away to someone who already had a seat albiet not as good as ours."
8914,Date of experience: October 2017,10-Oct-17,SEC,Alabama,5,Fantastic venue,Best stadium in the best conference in NCAA football!!  Love the atmosphere and gameday here. Highly recommend a visit!!
8915,Date of experience: September 2017,6-Oct-17,SEC,Alabama,4,Cool place at a cool school,"This stadium has many amenities you would expect at a top  football program.  The are around it offers many fun things to do.  The one thing I would recommend is, walk...do not drive around the stadium during the day before a game or the day of a game.  Many blocks closed and walking is by far much faster!"
8916,Date of experience: October 2017,4-Oct-17,SEC,Alabama,5,Check it off my Bucket List,We made a detour on our way home from Orange Beach so I could put my feet on the ground where the Bama teams past present and future have walked.  I loved it.  You can feel the magic in the air it was a wonderful experience that my husband made possible for me.
8917,Date of experience: October 2017,4-Oct-17,SEC,Alabama,5,Amazing,Took part in a ??Game Day Experience?? advertised on the Bama app. My trip to the sideline for the halftime show was a once in a lifetime experience!!! The staff was outstanding and really helped to make it special!
8918,Date of experience: October 2017,1-Oct-17,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide Roll,You can't beat Bryant Denny Stadium on a Saturday night game! Crowds are the best and team thrills. All seats are good and plenty of tvs around.

The feelings inside and outside the stadium are wonderful. If there is the chance to watch a game! GO THERE!Outside the stadium are the same people in total as in the stadium! Tailgaiting is all around it!Feel free and enjoy it!
8922,Date of experience: August 2017,19-Sep-17,SEC,Alabama,5,Must Visit for College Football Fans,"If you are looking for a place to see a college football game on your bucket list, include an Alabama football game at Bryant-Denny Stadium. My wife and I visited from Colorado to witness the Alabama-CSU football game and were awed by the entire game day experience. The Crimson Tide band was terrific, the public address system was clear and easy to hear who carried the ball, who the tacklers were, etc. Even though our school lost 41-23, it doesn't take away the experience of watching a game at Bryant-Denny Stadium."
8923,Date of experience: September 2017,19-Sep-17,SEC,Alabama,5,College Football at its best,Nothing like tailgating at the quad.  Amazing.  Positive vibe.  Get a spot in a group with a tent and enjoy the day!   Roll tide!
8924,Date of experience: September 2017,17-Sep-17,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide!,Your football experience is imcomplete if you have never seen a game at Bryant Denney. Parking can be tough and the music is too loud. I really wish they would just let the band play!
8925,Date of experience: September 2017,17-Sep-17,SEC,Alabama,5,Memorable experience,Had a chance to go to an Alabama game yesterday and it was awesome. Near the stadium there were plenty of restaurants and bars. Plenty of scalpers selling tickets at a fraction of what I paid on stub hub. This is an iconic college football program and a must see for any die hard college football fan.
8926,Date of experience: September 2017,17-Sep-17,SEC,Alabama,5,"Next time were bringing tickets for Mr Huey, for outstanding customer service!!!!","Mr Huey,thanks for outstanding customer service!!!! thanks for turning the lights on in customer service, for what could been a nightmare, you made our stay a super night of rest."
8928,Date of experience: September 2017,10-Sep-17,SEC,Alabama,5,WOW,"I have now visited 42 college stadiums.  This is clearly one of the best.  It has great sight lines, plenty of restrooms and concessions and a great atmosphere. I'm not an Alabama football fan, but you can't help but be in awe of the tradition and the tasteful displays of past glory that surrounds the stadium.  I recommend a trip highly."
8929,Date of experience: November 2016,6-Sep-17,SEC,Alabama,5,ROLL TIDE!!,Well maybe I'm a little biased but I do love the BD stadium!  Took my son on the stadium tour and he loved it. The only negative thing about BD stadium is that it doesn't get LOUD enough when the entire stadium is cheering. I guess it's just the way the stadium is built. ROLL TIDE!
8931,Date of experience: October 2016,23-Aug-17,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide!!!,This place has an incredible atmosphere for the Bama fan.  There is all kinds of foods to enjoy.  Wish parking was not so difficult.

I could have stood in line for autographs from players and coaches, but I was happy to just take some pictures and walk on the field."
8941,Date of experience: November 2016,26-Jul-17,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide!,"Absolutely fabulous stadium for accommodating the large crowds supporting the Crimson Tide team. I generally don't enjoy attending large events, but I will always be willing to see a game here."
8943,Date of experience: October 2016,20-Jul-17,SEC,Alabama,5,Best place to watch the Crimson Tide Roll.,"If you are an Alabama Football fan, you must watch at least one game in Bryant-Denny.

8970,Date of experience: September 2016,5-Apr-17,SEC,Alabama,5,Wonderful,There is so much to say about Bryant Denny that I would need many more characters. Great seats and views from anywhere you seat. Just a booming atmosphere.
8971,Date of experience: August 2016,3-Apr-17,SEC,Alabama,5,Obviously the best part of Tuscaloosa!,"Anytime I come through Tuscaloosa in the fall, I try to grab tickets for a Crimson Tide football game. The games at Bryant Denny are a unique experience. I was a student here, so I am probably biased! But if you're at all a fan of SEC football, I think it's worth it to go down and stroll around the stadium. It's beautiful in the fall, though there's no access into the main area except on game day. Stop by Zoes Kitchen on the back side of the stadium!"
8972,Date of experience: January 2017,30-Mar-17,SEC,Alabama,5,Stadium of Champions,"No better place to spend on a football Saturday in the South. Lots of traditions and lots of pride. Numerous Championships, too. Go early enough to stroll through the Walk if Champions."
8975,Date of experience: November 2016,17-Mar-17,SEC,Alabama,5,Great place to experience Bama football,"Bryant Denny Stadium is a gem.  The stadium is located right on the campus of University of Alabama.  The streets surrounding it are closed on gameday so driving close is tough, but it is easy to walk to from all over campus and from the many off campus parking spots. Go early and take a photo on the Walk of Champions and greet team as they go into the stadium.  The atmosphere in the stadium during a game is electric and the Bama fans are crazy (in a good way).  The stadium is relatively clean, the concessions are decent and the women's restrooms are plentiful and clean.  Roll Tide!!!"
8976,Date of experience: November 2016,6-Mar-17,SEC,Alabama,5,THIS is Tuscaloosa,"Any college football fan must put Bryant Denny on their bucket list. Game days are LEGENDARY. Clean, fun, entertaining...always something to do. In fact, many game days have thousands of people tailgating outside the stadium with no tickets. The Walk of Champions is a photo op as are the regal fraternity houses that flank the stadium. Security is top notch as no traffic is allowed near the stadium (be prepared to walk)."
8977,Date of experience: September 2016,1-Mar-17,SEC,Alabama,5,Amazing Stadium,Attended SEC football game. The excitement and experience is amazing. The stadium is one of the best in the country and enjoyed the time spent. Worth the time.
8978,Date of experience: December 2016,15-Feb-17,SEC,Alabama,5,Best college stadium in the country,"Bryant-Denny Stadium is the BEST college football stadium. I have been to LSU,TN, AU, MS, Vandy, NO Superdome and ATL and Bama's stadium is the best. In BDS I have sat in the End Zone upper deck, The Zone, the private boxes and in the general admission and they are ALL great seats. If you get a chance GO experience the best college experience you will ever have."
8979,Date of experience: October 2016,14-Feb-17,SEC,Alabama,5,Game Day Experience,"Game Day experience is outstanding. Atmosphere is unbelievable. The venue has plenty of access. Parking can be a challenge, but shuttle transportation is provided from more remote parking locations."
8982,Date of experience: September 2016,30-Jan-17,SEC,Alabama,5,Love this stadium,"This stadium is amazing, and a very enjoyable experience for all! It is a little hard on traffic from the football games but it is to be expected."
8983,Date of experience: January 2017,30-Jan-17,SEC,Alabama,4,Temple to Bama Football,I walked all around the stadium on a day after the end of the 2016 season. The facility was closed to the public but cheerleaders were practicing on the field. The impressive steps and sculpture in the front are across the road from a massive installation of satellite dishes calculated to let the world know what this university stands for. And that is football.
8984,Date of experience: October 2016,17-Jan-17,SEC,Alabama,5,BAMA football game,"I love Bryant Denny Stadium! The front glass encased entrance is absolutely beautiful. The lawn is well manicured & attractive. The statues showcasing the likes of Coach Nick Saban, the legendary Coach Paul Bear Bryant, Coach Gene Stallings & others makes for a great trip down memory lane. The inside of the stadium is clean & very modernized. The big screens are an asset in viewing replays & watching footage of the players & their accomplishments. The ribbon board displays are great for game stats, crowd boosters & announcing scores from other games. I could go on and on. You will just have to come to a BAMA football game & see how beautiful the stadium is for yourself! ROLL TIDE!"
8985,Date of experience: December 2016,31-Dec-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide!!!,"If you're an Alabama football fan, this is a must, pass by to take your pictures with sculptures past and present football coaches..."
8987,Date of experience: November 2016,28-Dec-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Love this place,"This is one of the happiest spots in the South. Love Roll Tide football. The staff here is always so friendly and the service is great. We have football season tickets and while we don't go to every home game, we're proud of this gem in Tuscaloosa"
8988,Date of experience: November 2016,17-Dec-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Great College Football Stadium,"Just a magnificent place to watch a football game. I went to my first game at the stadium in 1973. It is hard to believe this is even the same stadium.It has gone from 60,000 seats to over 100,000,with every expansion the game experience has gotten better and better.All fans of The University should be proud of their football home."
8989,Date of experience: December 2016,14-Dec-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Must for Bama fans,"This is a must for all Bama Fans. U get to see all the stadium including locker rooms, presidents box, sky boxes, coaches offices, Sabans office, etc,"
8990,Date of experience: September 2016,8-Dec-16,SEC,Alabama,5,ROLL TIDE,Great stadium - easy access if you can find a ticket. During hot (miserable heat) the stadium offers watering stations to keep spectators cool if that's even possible. I bought a large cup of ice water and was able to refill the water in the ladies room (ask for extra ice). Crazy crazy crazy FUN FANS and should be on any fans bucket list. Sing Sweet Home Alabama and stay till the end to hear the Rammer Jammer cheer. Yea Alabama Crimson Tide! #rtrBeautiful sunsets too.
8991,Date of experience: November 2016,30-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Best of the SOUTH.,No other stadium compares to Bryant Denny Stadium.  Beautiful campus and just an awesome place to visit.  Roll Tide Roll.
8992,Date of experience: November 2016,28-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Alabama vs Auburn Game,"The absolute BEST stadium in the nation! It doesn't get any better than a beautiful Iron Bowl afternoon in Alabama! The stadium was rocking, and the teams were ready to play! The best rivalry in college football never disappoints, especially when your team wins! I recommend going to the Walk of Champions even if the stadium is closed. However, if you've never been to a football game at Bryant Denny Stadium, try to get tickets, and treat yourself to the best college football experience ever! Roll Tide!"
8993,Date of experience: November 2016,27-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Not a good place for visiting teams,"Loved the entire Crimson Tide experience. If you play for Auburn, LSU or  Tennessee you probably won't leave happy. Fans are actually pretty decent to visiting fans. There are tours and they are great."
8994,Date of experience: November 2016,27-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Home Game for the TIDE,I enjoy watching the Tide home games every chance I get. When the Tide gets rolling the noise in the stadium is deafening!
8995,Date of experience: November 2016,27-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Bama vs. Mississippi State.,Horrible game but great trip. Free tickets and a parking pass were too good to ignore. Great atmosphere.
8996,Date of experience: November 2016,27-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Football Home Games,"Great football, stAdium has plenty of seating, security, clean restrooms, variety of concessions. Seats over 100,000 and has very good parking and shuttling of fans. Could improve stocking vendors. They always run out of pizza or chicken or nachos or pretzels or peanuts before fourth quarter. ALWAYS. Why?Roll Tide."
8997,Date of experience: November 2016,26-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Great Stadium,"Plan your trip out in advance. Purchase tickets for the game and parking in advance. When you get here, find the shuttles. The shuttles will save you some time. You can only purchase programs outside the gate. Check the website to see what you are allowed to bring in."
8998,Date of experience: November 2016,25-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Best college football experience you can ever have!,If you have never been to Bryant-Denny for a game you're in for a treat! Don't pass up the opportunity if you have one. It's a blast!! Iron Bowl 2016 will mark my 136th Alabama game. ROLL TIDE!!!
8999,Date of experience: November 2016,23-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Best college football stadium,Bryant Denny stadium is a great place to watch football and has to be the cleanest stadium I have ever been to. Roll Tide!
9000,Date of experience: November 2016,22-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,4,Great place to watch a game,"As someone who's been to the great Beaver Stadium on many occasions, I was looking forward to comparing Bryant Denny to it.  This is also a nice stadium with a great atmosphere.  The Million Dollar Band is great."
9001,Date of experience: November 2016,20-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Great stadium.,"It's a football stadium.  If there's nothing really wrong with it, and there isn't, then it's great.  Negative for some people: upper decks have bleacher seats with no backs."
9002,Date of experience: November 2016,20-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Family friendly and economical,"I visited the stadium for the first time on November 19, 2016. There were many families, couples and friends there to see the football game and overall the vibe was so positive! The American, exciting spirit for the love of football was apparent in this exciting Alabama venue. Employees and visitors were so kind and polite- I really enjoy the people of Alabama and their hospitality makes me want to be a better person. I had such a fun time at the game and the experience was low stress and economical...I purchased nachos, a pretzel and 5 large drinks..the cost was $35. I thought the cost was so reasonable! I highly recommend visiting this stadium and experiencing one of the many joys of the University of Alabama's beautiful campus! I will definitely be back!"
9003,Date of experience: November 2016,20-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Best venue in town,Nothing better than coming to see am Alabama game . Event staff very courteous and helpful. Concessions are not overpriced like most sport venues.
9004,Date of experience: November 2016,19-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide ROLL!,Fantastic stadium for the finest football team in the SEC! Value tickets give you a $10 coupon for concessions. Nick Saban is a god. RTR!
9005,Date of experience: November 2016,19-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Awesome Ballgame!!!!,Enjoyed watching the Alabama football Game tonight. Our seats were awesome-40 yard line and row 12. Great vantage point for viewing the game!!! Tried the Dreamland nachos... mouthwatering!!  What a great outing tonight!!!
9007,Date of experience: November 2016,17-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,5,AMAZING,"A mecca for any true Alabama fan.  Great to be in the stadium with 100,000 of our closest friends.  ROLL TIDE"
9008,Date of experience: October 2016,17-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,4,Aggie Football at Bama,"We were here for the Alabama vs. Texas A&M game. The stadium was really nice and easy to navigate, for the most part. It is seriously lacking in elevators for people with mobility issues. Our entrance was actually on a pretty steep slant, which made it difficult for my older mother, with knee and back problems. Then, to take the very steep ramps, she was hurting by the time we reached our seats. From what I could tell, the only elevators were on the home side of the stadium...nothing for visitors. I will say the ADA parking and shuttle service was pretty handy. They dropped us off right at the stadium, so we only had to walk around to the other side from where we were dropped off.Everyone we ran into was very nice and welcoming. We would definitely be happy to come back for another game."
9009,Date of experience: November 2016,17-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Great Venue for the Greatest Team,"Large , No smoking, No Alcohol sold. Cleaner bathrooms than other stadiums. Was happy to watch The Tide Smash the Bulldogs."
9010,Date of experience: November 2016,16-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Great stadium,"In my humble opinion there is no finer stadium to watch a Bama football game. The Million dollar Band forming the script ""A"" and spelling out BAMA prior to the team's entry is great to watch and then the Loud music as Sweet Home Alabama blares from the stadium speakers s Nick Saban leads the team onto the field is one of the greatest football events in the SEC. Seating anywhere in the stadium offers great views of the field and crowd participation during the game is loud and consistent. A big plus for the older crowd that might have seat in the upper decks is the constant golf cart shuttles that run from the bottom to the top of the stadium. And to be able participate in the game ending Rammer Jammer cheer is something that every Bama fan should experience at least once."
9011,Date of experience: October 2016,16-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,4,Alabama Football Game,"We attended a football game at the stadium. Everything was nice, I really enjoyed myself. I go to at  least 3 home games a year. The food was good, or I was hungry.I plan to go to somemore home games before the season is over."
9012,Date of experience: November 2016,15-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,4,Alabama football game,"Great game. But, the stadium is seriously lacking in elevators and ride help for people who have trouble walking up the stairs or very long ramps to the higher seating areas."
9013,Date of experience: November 2016,15-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,4,TIDE HOME,"The stadium is typical with no great amenities; just home to the Crimson Tide. Awesome!  By the way, the restrooms are sub-par. Hold it if you can."
9014,Date of experience: November 2016,15-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide,"This was my first Alabama football game.  The stadium was so much bigger than I imagined.   The stadium itself is beautiful, the walk of champions  and the statues of Coach Saban and the former coaches are very cool to look at.  It is all well marked  where the gates are and it was easy to get in and out.  Great experience.  Roll Tide Roll."
9015,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Bama Football,I bought four tickets on stub hub and went to the Alabama Mississippi State football game. The stadium is easy to navigate and an amazing environment. You have the ability to walk down by the field for pictures. Our seats were section C row 58 seats one through four. They were good seats but I would recommend something in the 30s as walking up to row 58 could be a challenge for some
9016,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Wow! This place is big!,"I've been in this stadium many times over the years and the additions over the years had made this place hold more than 100,000 fans. The staff and volunteers make the game day experience enjoyable for all fans."
9017,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,5,College Football Must Visit,Everyone should attend an Alabama home football game if possible.  The stadium is fantastic and truly worth a visit!
9018,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide!,"Best game day experience out there!  No bad seat/view in the stadium.  Lots of bathrooms, and lines move quickly.  The guards are also pretty lax -- never had a problem sneaking in our game booze!"
9019,Date of experience: October 2016,10-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,4,"Beautiful campus, and bright, and loud","We were here for the Alabama vs. Texas A&M game, and everyone was super nice, and the stadium was brightly lit in the evening, the bathrooms had their own problems, but people were trying to help.The city of Tuscaloosa had water problems which effected the stadium bathrooms, but it was not UA's problem.The lines were long to do anything but everyone was smiling and being nice."
9022,Date of experience: October 2016,1-Nov-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Beautiful facility,Fantastic stadium in the corner of campus.  New center walkway highlights their many National Championships.
9023,Date of experience: September 2016,28-Oct-16,SEC,Alabama,5,"The best, DUH!  Roll Tide","Love Bryant Denny!  Whether inside or hanging out outside the stadium, it's a great place to be. Love the walk of champions outside and watching a game inside is the best!"
9024,Date of experience: September 2016,26-Oct-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide!,"As an Alabama fan, Bryant Denny is one of my favorite places to visit!  In my opinion, the stadium is one of the best in all of college football."
9025,Date of experience: October 2016,25-Oct-16,SEC,Alabama,4,Very nice stadium,"Attended recent top 10 showdown and came away impressed with Bryant-Denny stadium. The stadium is large and clean. We were seated in the visitor's upper end zone section, but the seating was not too steep like it is in some places. The aluminum bleachers had backs which was a big positive. Also, the seat numbers weren't crammed too closely together which is often the case in stadiums of 100K. Concessions were adequate, but nothing to write home about. All the employees I encountered were helpful and friendly. Pretty standard for SEC venues, but still nice to see.The two points that drop this to a 4 star from a 5 star review are the stairs and the bathrooms. First, the stairs. In our area we were forced to climb stairs. There were no ramps to use. I think most of us middle-aged and older folks would have preferred ramps. Second some of the mens rooms had a strange design with the sinks separated from the actual rest room portion in a strange way. It's kind of hard to explain exactly, but it was kind of confusing and led to unnecessary congestion between quarters and at halftime. I don't understand the purpose of it.Anyway, one of the better stadiums around especially for a larger one."
9026,Date of experience: September 2016,24-Oct-16,SEC,Alabama,4,House divided Alabama grad and Gator band member clash,Not really...my wife went to Alabama so it's always great for her to visit especially when my son is playing for the football game for the Florida Gators. An impressive site with all those raving fans.
9027,Date of experience: October 2016,23-Oct-16,SEC,Alabama,5,vs Texas A&M,Great pro style stadium with a great atmosphere for someone just going to catch the football game. The tailgating on the quad prior to the game also lived up to the hype.
9028,Date of experience: October 2016,23-Oct-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Wow!,"Being an Aggie when we visit other stadiums we find ourselves disappointed a tad because most of the time they are just bigger versions of high school stadiums. Bryant Denny is huge, crazy loud and the Alabama fans have a cheer or chant for almost every kind of play there is. Great experience for watching a college football game. The concessions were fairly fast and I loved how they give opportunities for different organizations to volunteer and work to help raise funds. You don't see a lot of that anymore. You get some nice southern appreciative volunteers helping move the lines along."
9029,Date of experience: October 2016,23-Oct-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Bama games,All football fans need to experience an Alabama game at Bryant Denny stadium.  The tradition and energy can't be beat.  Experiencing a game here is a MUST.  Roll Tide Roll!
9030,Date of experience: October 2016,22-Oct-16,SEC,Alabama,1,Awful,"Went for a football game but got blasted with noise, not from the bands or fans but from the speakers. Gave several people headaches. Tried to get a soda at halftime but lines were backed up."
9031,Date of experience: October 2016,21-Oct-16,SEC,Alabama,5,"Awesome place, electrifying!  Rolllll, Tide!","Fun experience, especially if you are a Tide fan!  Game day is exceptional. We were lucky enough to be in a skybox, which doubled the fun!"
9032,Date of experience: October 2016,20-Oct-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Homecoming 2016,Second time at the stadium for a home game and it is a beautiful stadium and the grounds are so well kept.
9033,Date of experience: October 2016,17-Oct-16,SEC,Alabama,5,College Football at It's Best,A state of the art stadium with 4 huge screens. Not a bad seat in the house. Tailgating at its finest outside where there are 50K=100K depending on which game..
9035,Date of experience: October 2016,9-Oct-16,SEC,Alabama,5,"Tradition, Comfort, Convenience","Few stadiums in America are as steeped in tradition as Bryant Denny.  From the Walk of Fame to the bronze statues of Championship-winning coaches to the handsome interior spaces, this place blends the best of the past and present seamlessly.I have had expensive seats, average seats, and seats in various bloody nose sections and they all provided comfortable views of the field, players and Jumbotrons (spelling?). Also, this is a family place.  From babies to the very elderly, everyone seems to enjoy themselves here.  It is near the very heart of the campus, with plenty of shady, ancient trees and plenty of tailgating areas.  Restaurants, bars, and Publix are all very close.  It's hard to beat this place for a great game day experience, even if the Tide hangs 50 points on your team. ;-)"
9036,Date of experience: October 2016,7-Oct-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Awesome,I have been to BDS many times and love the experience!  The atmosphere is exceptional and it's hard to beat high quality SEC football.   The concession stand has good food but I don't buy it because it is over priced. I always enjoy my time at BDS even if the Tide don't Roll.
9037,Date of experience: September 2016,1-Oct-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Awesome,This is a must-see. We are huge Alabama fans first time we've ever been to Tuscaloosa stopped at the stadium fell in love. Very professional very clean. ROLL TIDE ROLL
9038,Date of experience: September 2016,28-Sep-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Family Weekend at University,"Beautiful football stadium. Very organized being that it holds 100,000 people and many other tailgates going on at the campus on game day."
9039,Date of experience: September 2016,28-Sep-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Great service,"Went to the the Kent State FB game on 9/24.  The folks working the stadium could not have been more friendly.  We had a supervisor that took us around to the other side of the stadium to rent seat backs just so we would not get lost.  I wish i knew his name, but this extra effort was very nice.  In addition, every one else was very nice and they handle the large crowds well."
9040,Date of experience: September 2016,27-Sep-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide!,"We experienced our first college football game here and loved the excitement the fans brought to the game. The stadium was within walking distance from our hotel. There was pregame activities, including autographs from former players and plenty of vendors for anything & everything UA. The stadium didn't have a bad seat in the house. We had a bird's eye view, but it was still a great seat. Could easily still see the game and the players. If walking is an issue, make sure to get an elevator pass because the walk up, in the heat especially, can be tiring. Either way, if you are a Crimson Tide fan, this is something not to miss."
9041,Date of experience: September 2016,26-Sep-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide Roll!,"Bryant Denny Stadium  is the most impressive stadium I have ever been in.  The sound system is amazing, the facilities are clean and sufficient for the 100,000+ fans in attendance.  And, of course, the home team is second to none!  Roll Tide!"
9042,Date of experience: September 2016,26-Sep-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Amazing,"Ive been many times to Bryant Denny. As an alumni of UA, its always great to be back in Tuscaloosa. The stadium is amazing. Huge, easy access, affordable, and wonderful atmosphere. The best in college football."
9043,Date of experience: September 2016,25-Sep-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Western Kentucky Game,I always love Gameday in Tuscaloosa no matter who the opponent is.  It's always a great experience on campus and especially in Bryant Denny Stadium.  A must on a bucket list.
9044,Date of experience: September 2016,25-Sep-16,SEC,Alabama,5,The Mecca for all Alabama fans!,"I've been to Bryant-Denny Stadium twice now and it's always a great experience. I'm convinced that there truly isn't a bad seat in the house. We've sat in the ""cheap seats"" both times now and were able to see everything. The four large video-screens makes it even easier to see what's going on.The atmosphere is great and always exciting even when it's a non-conference opponent. Everything is always clean and up to date. I believe I saw people attending to the restrooms the entire time I was there.Concessions are a little expensive (to be expected). Recently we went on what ended up tying the hottest game ever at the stadium and ended up spending over $20 (Water bottles were $4 each and Cokes ranged from $5-$6 for a commemorative cup) on drinks alone just to stay hydrated. Concessions made a killing that day, but what are you going to do? The only real issue we have is parking. You're going to shell out at least $20 minimum and you may end up pretty far away from the stadium itself. You can reserve a parking space a day before the game, but there's no guarantee that it'll be in a lot any close to the stadium than the other options.Otherwise, I highly recommend going. It really is a top notch stadium and is a lot of fun!"
9045,Date of experience: September 2016,25-Sep-16,SEC,Alabama,3,Stadium seating is unconfoerable,We purchased 2 tickets in section F row 46. They we stadium armchair seats. The view from these seats was great. However there was absolutely no leg room for me and therefore it was worse for my husband as his legs are longer than mine. I left for the tunnel before the end of the 1st quarter. It was extremely hot and humid so that didn't make things better for sure. I thought there were no bad seats in Bryant Denny. I was wrong. Stay away from stadium seats!!
9046,Date of experience: September 2016,25-Sep-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Awesome Experience!!,Sat in U2 section N for an 11:00 kick off. The first few rows were in the sun for the first half. Really great view of field. Walk of Champions before the game was great. Area is well maintained and campus is beautiful. Great place to see a game.

9051,Date of experience: September 2016,14-Sep-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Great Experience,I am an Alabama alum so I'm biased but the entire experience is always fun at the stadium. Its very easy to walk to and get in and out of. Concessions and restrooms work well. The Event Group that manages traffic does a great job.
9052,Date of experience: September 2016,14-Sep-16,SEC,Alabama,5,ROLL TIDE!!!,"Not a bad seat in the stadium.  Fairly quick in and out despite over 100K people.  Best of all, it's home of the greatest college football team in history!"
9054,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Not a bad seat in the house,Just visited the stadium for the game and could not have been happier with the experience. The staff was gracious and welcoming and the crowd was electrifying. I will be returning in the future.

Parking is a breeze, minimal traffic after the game. The U of A has it down pat to handle that many people and  expedite them out quickly after games. Everyone is very courteous, even to Auburn fans....."
9058,Date of experience: September 2016,10-Sep-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide Roll,This is the place for football on campus for over 100 years built by Dr George Denny. Alabama fans make this place rock during high powered games against SEC and other foes. If you hang around the stadium until the game starts scalpers will come down on their prices to unload tix. Roll TideRoll
9059,Date of experience: August 2016,7-Sep-16,SEC,Alabama,5,There's nothing quite like gameday in Bryant Denny,There's nothing I can say that hasn't been said already. Alabama immortalizes football and B-Denny is just one of the ways that they do that. Gamedays there are as good as it gets.

9063,Date of experience: November 2015,22-Aug-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Home of the best college football fans.,"Best college football atmosphere. Even if your not an Alabama fan you will enjoy it. The pageantry,the people, the town it all comes to life every Saturday in the fall. Catch a game or just hang at The Quad."
9064,Date of experience: August 2016,22-Aug-16,SEC,Alabama,5,"Fun, exciting, and you almost always get to see Alabama win!  This has got to be the most beautiful collegiate football!","The Walk of Champions is amazing, with plaques in the ground depicting all the SEC and National Championship teams and the captains for that year.  Beside the walk are statues of the head football coaches who have won National Championships, and there are FIVE coaches with a total of 16 championships.  This is definitely worth a trip to Tuscaloosa.  It is right on campus, and there are stores to buy souvenirs right down the street, as well as many different kinds of restaurants. Gamedays here are wild, whether you are a Bama fan or opposing team fan, or just a fan of collegiate football."
9065,Date of experience: October 2015,16-Aug-16,SEC,Alabama,4,Beautiful Stadium,"We really enjoy going to Bryant Denny Stadium for a University of Alabama football game once a year.  We drive 12 hours and usually stay overnight before and after the game.  We attended the homecoming game last year and the excitement in the stadium is an experience in itself.   The entire complex is huge and there are multiple gates to enter, so be sure to pay attention to the directions for the gates.  The ticket takers are very polite and there are always a lot of help to get you to the correct location.  The only reason I gave it a very good rating instead of excellent is that there is the same food at all the food locations.  Some of us would love to be able to get something not on a bun.  They do have plenty of workers and of course homecoming is extremely crowded and I think they did an excellent job.  The band, the team, the fans, are something everyone should experience at least once.  We love you University of Alabama! Roll Tide!"
9066,Date of experience: August 2016,16-Aug-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Southern Hospitality at its best,"We had the privilege of walking through the tunnel from the locker room to the field during our visit during move in weekend, 2016. The staff was very accommodating and even took a pix of me with my husband by the goal posts."
9067,Date of experience: October 2015,8-Aug-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Definitely worth the trip,"Whether you are an Alabama die-hard fan or just want an adrenaline rush, nothing beats 104,000+ rabid fans cheering another Alabama TD or kickoff or singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"". This sleepy town, despite 45,000 students, swells to over 250,000 on game days. Gotta' experience it to believe it!"

9074,Date of experience: October 2015,25-Jul-16,SEC,Alabama,1,you pay alot of money and get treated like a terrorist,"Bryant Denny is packed with history. It used to be relatively easy to get to on game day, very relaxed while entering the stadium, affordable and fun to watch the Tide roll. Well, not anymore. If you go, expect an expensive ordeal, overpriced tickets, long lines, enhanced security, and absolutely no where in miles to park a car. Save the wear and tear on your nerves and take in the game on TV."
9077,Date of experience: September 2015,14-Jul-16,SEC,Alabama,5,ROLL TIDE!,The house that Bryant built and Saban expanded. I am biased but after going to many college stadiums Bryant-Denny gives a great seat anywhere and has a really professional big stadium feel. Of course the Crimson Tide is as close to a pro team as you will find in college football. The atmosphere around the stadium and all over town for all the tailgaters is so alive and fun and surprisingly friendly to visitors.
9078,Date of experience: August 2015,13-Jul-16,SEC,Alabama,5,"If you're in Tuscaloosa, then you've heard ""Roll Tide.""","Bryant Denny Stadium is a trademark in Tuscaloosa, and a must if you visit. It's only become bigger over the years. I believe now it seats a capacity of 101,821 people! You can see it peeping over things in certain areas of town (by Jack Warner Pkwy off of Hwy 82, and coming down the bypass 359 towards downtown.) It's fun to go to at least one Alabama home game... especially since Alabama has a college football [winning] tradition."
9080,Date of experience: September 2015,12-Jul-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Bama's Best,If you are a Bama fan you will definitely want to take the time to go to Bryant Denny Stadium even if you aren't there to attend a football game.  The Walk of Champions honors the coaches who have led Alabama to numerous National Championships and is a true testament to a great football program.

It's not only a beautiful stadium but the entire atmosphere is pure excitement. A great place to watch the home team win. Roll Tide!BTW, there is a seating capacity of 101,821 since the 2010 expansion. When you add up those digits (1+0+1+8+2+1) you get 13 which was the number of National Championship UA had won by 2010!"

We had a wonderful time watching the winning teamAlabama. Before the game, we shopped at some of the shops at the university and ate at some of the fast food restaurants. Walked around the tail gate area and just had a lot of fun. Great weather too."

The stadium it beautiful and on game-day it's so energizing.  I love the walk of champions on the North side of the stadium.  On game day it's congested but there is a lot to see and do so get there early.  Parking costs $ everywhere so bring a 20 or better for that."

9091,Date of experience: September 2015,3-Jun-16,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide!,T-town or bust!!!  This was my second SEC game. I have never been in a college stadium with this capacity.  It was my first Alabama game and we had the best seats!  Thanks to the hubs for that stroke of luck.  This is a beautiful stadium and who knew the fans could actually stand right beside the fence.  My youngest daughter was taking a video of one of the touchdowns and it was right in front of her face.  She literally could have reached her hand over the fence and touched the player.  I highly recommend this place for the sports enthusiast.  We had a wonderful experience and will be returning every year for at least one game.  Roll Tide!!!

This stadium is enormous and the enthusiasm and spirit you feel here cannot not be matched anywhere.  This stadium sits of the University of Alabama's campus and is home to the Alabama Crimson Tide, National Champions 2016.  The enthusiasm and pride for this football team is off the charts.  Love Big Al, the Tide mascot, he is fantastic with the crowd and the Million Dollar Band keeps the momentum going. Roll Tide!"

We always go about 3 hours early and find a good place to eat.  When you get to the stadium , the spirit of the Crimson Tide is very apparent.  The stadium is amazing.  The crowds are always ready to cheer the Alabama football team on to another victory. Try the nachos and get extra red peppers with them, and of course get the large coke in the  souvenir cup.  By the way...... ( ROLL TIDE ROLL)"
9107,Date of experience: September 2015,13-Apr-16,SEC,Alabama,5,There's Football...then There's Football at Bryant Denny,"I've been fortunate enough to enjoy college and pro football at a number of stadiums.  None of them beat experiencing college football at Bryant Denny.  Despite the disappointment of attending Bama's only 2015 loss, the overall experience was amazing.   Watching a game with that many rabid fans is awesome.  You'll never forget it.  We found it easy to get in and get out.  The only thing that lacked was the quality of the concessions, but that is a nit.  You go to see the best football in the land.  Here's a tip: If you cannot stand the heat be careful when attending the early fall games.  It can get very hot in Tuscaloosa."
9113,Date of experience: November 2015,22-Mar-16,SEC,Alabama,5,ROLL TIDE,"My boyfriend and I both are from Ohio, but we are Alabama fans so I surprised him with tickets for an early Christmas present two years ago.

This stadium is bigger and better than Soldier Field. The energy going on at this place on game day is incredible. You have to go early and hang out at the Quad and make sure to line up at the Walk of Champions when the team arrives.If possible, take a walk around the stadium the day before when it's not crowded so you can check out the Walk of Champions and the coach's statues and get yourself some good pics."

However, the experience is truly worth a lot more. In a stadium that holds over 100,000 rabid football fans, the atmosphere could scarcely be more electric. Even if you don't care about football, everyone should attend an Alabama game at Bryant Denny at least once. The experience is unlike any other."
9145,Date of experience: November 2015,15-Dec-15,SEC,Alabama,5,One of the best places for college football!,We come down at least 1-2 times per season as my son is a senior at Bama--what a fantastic gameday experience--especially on the quad!

Alabama's winning tradition is theme all around!,"Instead of shopping on Black Friday, we visited here instead and practically had the place to ourselves.  As fans, we loved everything about Bryant-Denny! The Walk of Champions, dedicated to players and coaches are a must see for all Tide Fans.

9157,Date of experience: October 2015,28-Oct-15,SEC,Alabama,5,Great Stadium with Southern Hospitality,"Really enjoyed our time at Bryant Denny Stadium.  It started with the Walk of Champions which is at the north entrance of the stadium.  Along the walk they have bronze statues of Nick Saban and former coaches who have won Alabama's 15 National Championships.  We never had to wait in any significant line either to use the bathrooms or when grabbing drinks from the vendors.  Everything seemed to be very well organized.  Everyone was very friendly and helpful.  Fans were friendly as well.Loved the hedges and iron fence along the field and the fact that you can walk down to this area and be at the same level as the players.  The 4 jumbotrons - one in each corner - allowed us to not miss a thing on the field.  The sound system was one of the clearest we have ever heard at a football game.  The experience felt more like being at an NBA game in the sense of the level of energy, great music, clear sound system and the jumbotrons.  It all made for a very enjoyable experience."
9158,Date of experience: October 2015,27-Oct-15,SEC,Alabama,5,Awesome Stadium!!,Always enjoy visiting Bryant Denny Stadium. This is the most excitement and all the staff is very friendly and welcoming .. Love this place..

Bryant-Denny Stadium is the best anywhere - it doesn't need a dome with gee-whizz skydoors to impress. Modern, yet classic, this stadium is the perfect home to Alabama football!  Nuff' said!"

9165,Date of experience: October 2015,16-Oct-15,SEC,Alabama,4,Fantastic Game - Beware of University Mall Shuttle,"My husband is Alabama alumni so we decided to attend a game at Tuscaloosa this year. We opted for the University Mall shuttle - seemed like a cheap way to get to the game without fighting the traffic.We had an amazing time at the game. The energy and vibe was so wonderful. On the way back to our truck I told the husband we should come every couple years.We returned to the mall to find our truck broken into, and the majority of our personal affects taken. The police was already in the parking lot because at least THREE other vehicles were broken into. Due to the tint on our glass they ripped the back glass out in one piece and threw it in the back of the truck. They basically said it happens all the time. Mall security was of no help - no cameras. Police was basically like yeah, just stinks to be you....Go to the game at Bryant Denny Stadium! You will have a blast! But whatever you do DON'T LEAVE YOUR CAR AT THE MALL!!!"
9166,Date of experience: September 2015,15-Oct-15,SEC,Alabama,5,"It's the ""High Church"" of Football",To attend a game is simply an awesome experience.  Shuttles run from University Mall on gameday and drop you off right at the stadium for $10 pp.  This is everything college football is supposed to - RollTide!
9167,Date of experience: October 2015,14-Oct-15,SEC,Alabama,5,Amazing college football venue,"Just went to my second game at Bryant Denny Stadium. Having been to games at USC, UCLA, Oregon, Oregon State and UW, a 'Bama home game beats them all for the experience with USC a very close second for fun and coolness factors. There is not a bad seat in the house, we were in the endzone on the 3rd level this time and last time about the 10 yard line also 3rd level and we didn't miss a thing. Some reviewers say 85% bench seats but that is false only for the nose bleed and endzone sections, the rest are individual seats. Expensive to get in if you buy from stubhub etc, but worth the price of admission. Don't miss the awesome tailgating and food vendors on the green. The elephant stomp by the library is lots of fun. We had the chance to go to ""Nick @ Noon"" luncheon the day before game day and that was great. Nick Saban dispensed life wisdom, not just  football. Great weekend."
9168,Date of experience: October 2015,13-Oct-15,SEC,Alabama,4,Homecoming Weekend,"What an impressive stadium! We were in the cheap seats & still had a great view. Food vendors are a little one note, but it was totally worth going to watch the Crimson win!!"
9169,Date of experience: October 2015,12-Oct-15,SEC,Alabama,4,A Bucket List Stadium,"I can now cross Bryant Denny Stadium off of my bucket list.  This Stadium is a historical place to watch football.  One of the largest stadiums in the country with a great football heritage.  We attended the Arkansas/Alabama game on 10/8.  The stadium is extremely large and the seating is very good.  One negative is that the restroom areas and concessions are in a tight, narrow corridor that is very crowded.  At the end of the half time festivities, the lines to the restrooms and concessions were so long, I just gave up.  This is a stadium that any SEC fan should consider coming to just to say you've been here."
9170,Date of experience: October 2015,12-Oct-15,SEC,Alabama,5,Absolute must see for college football fans!,We were lucky enough to get good seats in the lower bowl near the goal line.  Let's just say that Alabama fans know how to make noise for their team.  The amount of energy in the stadium is amazing!  Great place to see a football game!
9171,Date of experience: October 2015,10-Oct-15,SEC,Alabama,4,Not unique but definitely FUN!,"This is a pretty big school. We went during homecoming and got to see their parade, which was really cool. I especially love the lawn mower - helmet thing the guy dressed as a football player drove. Some of the fraternities had some unique signs. The campus frat houses were beautiful. The Presidents house was incredible. The stadium itself was relatively unimpressive. A bit generic, and there weren't any very cool traditions. The best things were their ""roll tide"" 's and we heard ""Sweet Home Alabama"" more times than necessary! Some cool things, students get REALLY dressed up for the game. Dresses. Makeup. Galore. Think this is a southern thing! Take your red gear, be prepared to say hello and chit chat with everyone around you...and make sure to include some ""y'alls"" and ""yes sirs"" in there so they can't tell your a yankee. Yankees burned down the campus in 1865, so leave your NE social etiquette at home!"
9172,Date of experience: October 2015,10-Oct-15,SEC,Alabama,5,The BEST college football on earth!,Home to the University of Alabama's Crimson Tide Football team.  Its a bucket list destination for any sports fan.  Enjoy extreme tailgating on the quad prior to a game.  Stay to game's end to hear the fans chant their winning song.  Rammer Jammer Yeller Hammer Give em Alabama!
9173,Date of experience: September 2015,8-Oct-15,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide,If you're an Alabama football fan then you know about this place. If you aren't then you need to go to a game here. The tailgating is awesome as well as the atmosphere inside the stadium.
9174,Date of experience: October 2015,7-Oct-15,SEC,Alabama,4,Really nice stadium.,"This is a really nice stadium and in my opinion is nicer (and bigger by 30,000 seats) than Auburn. Great campus... Great Stadium."
9175,Date of experience: September 2015,1-Oct-15,SEC,Alabama,5,Great Saturday football tradition.,An excellent football stadium venue. This stadium is one that every seat can view the players on the field in an unobstructed manner - with the exception of fans that like to stand up.
9176,Date of experience: September 2015,30-Sep-15,SEC,Alabama,3,Felt like a sardine in a can,"First time to a college game on campus, always see them in pro stadiums. Would say 85% of stadium has bench seating. You can rent cushion with seat back while there. There is no room to move, you get kneed in the back elbowed from the front. It was fun watching the game, will spend the extra money to sit in stadium seating next year."
9177,Date of experience: September 2015,29-Sep-15,SEC,Alabama,5,could not find any trash,anywhere.  even the mens room has an attendant cleaning the place all the time.  no paper towels on the floor. Really quite remarkable.
9178,Date of experience: September 2015,29-Sep-15,SEC,Alabama,5,Great college football venue,"Great venue to watch a football game.  One of the better venues in the country for a college game.  Atmosphere is electric, fans are into the game but are also quite friendly, even to opposing fans.  We sat near the top and the view was still good.  One tip is that they allow you to bring an EMPTY bottle with you into the game.  So for hot days they'll have water stations where you can fill and re-fill your bottle which is really nice.  We made use of that frequently!"
9179,Date of experience: September 2015,29-Sep-15,SEC,Alabama,5,Walk of champions will give you chills,"You have to go, no matter who you pull for. My husband is a Gamecock fan and he was amazed. I sent pictures to my parents in Florida and my Dad was impressed was a part in building the Panther stadium... And I got to tour the Panther stadium before it was finish so from a construction point of view it is AMAZING... From a fan point of view it is OUT OF THIS WORLD! The sound system, TVs , cleanliness ... It's just awesome ! When you walk up the walk of champions and see all of the names on the side walk it gives you chills..."
9180,Date of experience: September 2015,28-Sep-15,SEC,Alabama,5,Amazing football venue,"What a great venue to watch a football game. We parked within 6 blocks of the stadium, great deals on fan gear outside the stadium. Of course food is not cheap, but no different than any other sports venue. fan gear"
9181,Date of experience: September 2015,27-Sep-15,SEC,Alabama,5,Great Stadium,We have had season tickets for almost 20 years. Needless to say that we love the Tide! We also park at the dch parking lot and walk to the game
9182,Date of experience: September 2015,25-Sep-15,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide!,Amazing place to watch a football game! So much enthusiasm from the crowd!  Great for people watching....never new there was so many options for Bama Fam game day dress!
9183,Date of experience: September 2015,24-Sep-15,SEC,Alabama,5,Always Fun!,It's always fun to attend a game at Bryant Denny especially when BAMA wins!  The seating is not the most comfortable but the atmosphere is terrific!  I can't rate the food because we never eat at the stadium.  We always tailgate or eat at one of Downtown Tuscaloosa's new restaurants.
9184,Date of experience: September 2015,23-Sep-15,SEC,Alabama,5,Great!,What a great atmospere!  It was an absolute pleasure being there.  I can't wait to come back and watch another Alabama football game.

9188,Date of experience: September 2015,20-Sep-15,SEC,Alabama,4,Ole Miss vs Bama game,"Great stadium, would say maybe the screens are a bit small esp when you put visiting teams families up in the nose bleed seats lol. Enjoyed a great Ole Miss, Bama game and yes Ole Miss won (barely). Fans were classy and congratulated us on an amazing win. Always love this stadium and its atmosphere. Would say only down side is would love a lrgr screen so our players don't look like tiny ants down there lol."
9189,Date of experience: September 2015,13-Sep-15,SEC,Alabama,4,Love Bama but not a fan of the new purse boxes.,When you enter that stadium they have a box you have to drop your handbag into. If it has to be shoved in it is unacceptable and you are asked to return it to your car. I happen to have purchased a Dooney Alabama handbag in January. It is within the notebook paper size however the bottom must be about 4.5 to 5 inches thick. If I put my bag in upside down it slides in but put in the right way and it does not. I went to three gates before getting it in. SO FYI!! You need to know the exact measurement now. Width matters. I will know from now on to leave it in the car. I had hundreds of comments on my bag while in town but almost couldn't get it in the game. When I purchased the bag I made sure it was within the limit posted at the time. My bag was under my seat the entire game and was not in anyone's way. The box needs to be just an inch or two wider. So many upset fans trying to get in the game with normal size handbags and were turned away. A stand selling t shirts near one entrance held some of the fans purses to keep them from going back to the car. I think they need to rent lockers outside of the stadium. This season they will rent fast!!! Food is expensive but no more so than any other venue like this. The fans around us were awesome. We are Bama fans and I sat next to a Middle Tenn fan. He was so nice. Good people everywhere!! Love T Town just not a fan of the new BOX.
9190,Date of experience: September 2015,13-Sep-15,SEC,Alabama,5,Worth it if you will be in the area,"I've been to professional football in 10 different stadiums and in shear size this was by far the biggest.  It is a party all around campus.  My complaint comes from my expectation being too high given price of ticket compared to amenities in stadium.  The concession is tiny serving simple hotdogs, burgers, pretzels and popcorn.  Also, be aware that no alcohol is served in the stadium.  If you are going to be in the area on a game day then it is worth it."
9191,Date of experience: November 2014,12-Sep-15,SEC,Alabama,5,The Place To See A College Football Game,"Passion, Tradition, History, The Process, The Fans, Big Al, The Million Dollar Band, Houndstooth, Sweet Home Alabama, Dixieland Delight, Championships, The Sack, The Kick, The Place To See A College Football Game.

9192,Date of experience: September 2015,7-Sep-15,SEC,Alabama,5,One of the best football stadiums in the U.S. with easy access to seating including elevators and handicap access,"A beautiful stadium with years of history displayed on the ""Champion's Walk"" leading to the main entrance.  Statues of former coaches and commemorative walkway listing all championships of the Alabama Crimson Tide football program make this an ideal setting for pictures.  This is an experience you don't want to miss when visiting Tuscaloosa."
9193,Date of experience: November 2014,18-Aug-15,SEC,Alabama,4,Roll Tide,Very nice stadium. Atomsphere is wonderful. People are great. They are glad you are visiting. Weather is great.
9194,Date of experience: September 2014,17-Aug-15,SEC,Alabama,5,An experience like no other!,"Can't miss the experience of watching a UA game here.  The crowd, their clothes, the rituals.  If you aren't a fan, still don't pass up the opportunity to attend a game here and experience a fan experience like no other.   Warning, seats in the upper deck are very steep.  Once you sit down, it's fine, but if you have older members of your party, plan to get them to their sit and to stay there, or splurge on lower deck seats if you can afford them!"
9196,Date of experience: August 2015,6-Aug-15,SEC,Alabama,5,"Pro level stadium, football fans will love","Imagine an NFL stadium on a college campus. That's the feel of Bryant Denny Stadium, and it is magnificent. This is truly an awesome sight and it's definitely worth a stop to check out the Walk of Champions. The University's campus is beautiful too."
9200,Date of experience: October 2014,18-Jul-15,SEC,Alabama,3,Nice stadium,"Nice stadium, doesn't look as old as it is. I'm not a found of the circular ramps to walk to the top, seems to take twice as long as stairs. Seems to have good views from every seat."
9201,Date of experience: October 2014,16-Jul-15,SEC,Alabama,5,ROLL TIDE,"What Bama fan doesn't want to experience Bryant Denny? Can I get a hot dog with that win? Thousands of fans cheer for the National Championship Team that has put Alabama on the National Radar. Maybe I am a bit biased. I am a BAMA Graduate. But either way, fan or competition, it is a fun place to experience."
9202,Date of experience: November 2014,12-Jul-15,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide - this is one impressive stadium,Don't miss the Walk of Champions leading to the entry of the stadium.  Plaques commemorating the 15 national football championships the Crimson Tide has won are embedded in the walkway leading up to the stadium.  Life sized bronze sculptures of the past and current head football coaches are in this area.
9204,Date of experience: November 2014,8-Jul-15,SEC,Alabama,5,Incredible Stadium!,"Love this stadium. We were in the nose bleed section but it was a GREAT view. The walk to the stadium is awesome, what a great city and venue. Drive as close as you can and park. It is quite a walk into the stadium but every view we had, awesome. The crowd and fans are great. Friendly and passionate. We had a great view and a great time."
9205,Date of experience: November 2014,7-Jul-15,SEC,Alabama,5,Best Place Ever,I feel like this is pretty obviously the best place on Earth. Unless you are the visiting team... Roll Tide

9207,Date of experience: November 2014,30-Jun-15,SEC,Alabama,5,Football,This is always a great place to attend a football game on a fall Saturday. Tailgating before and after is always a blast.
9208,Date of experience: November 2014,30-Jun-15,SEC,Alabama,5,Great tradition and unreal passion and fans.,The mecca of football stadiums . The passion of the fans and playing in the SEC makes it a dream come true to watch games here. The Quad is a great place to visit before the game..
9210,Date of experience: October 2014,30-Jun-15,SEC,Alabama,5,Great Stadium!,I have had the good fortune of experiencing the skybox as well as stadium seats.  This is an incredible experience from the 30/40 yard line.  The stadium is overwhelmingly huge and loud.  The Skybox is very spacious and has a private bathroom.  The food and service are great!
9215,Date of experience: November 2014,3-Jun-15,SEC,Alabama,5,This IS College Football,"Anyone who visits Tuscaloosa and knows anything about college football must walk (don't just drive by) up to Bryant Denny. Even if you dont care for Bama, you will get chill bumps walking up to the stadium and looking at the larger than life statues of the legendary coaches that made Alabama the standard of NCAA football."
9216,Date of experience: October 2014,1-Jun-15,SEC,Alabama,4,Best Hot Dogs,Very Nice Stadium with some of the best Hot dogs you can get on GameDay. The fans..well most are friendly but they have quite a large group of obnoxious fans.
9218,Date of experience: November 2014,28-May-15,SEC,Alabama,5,The Other Southern Religion,"Bryant Denny Stadium is the home of the SEC's (Southeastern conference's) infamous Alabama Crimson Tide football team. Having won multiple national championships throughout its history, the Tide so reigns in the heart of its fans that some stop to repent from their near-worshipful fervor.  When the stadium is sold out, fans bring lawn chairs and watch for free on a big screen nearby.  Plan to make a weekend of it--don your crimson, white or herringbone (and sunglasses) and head for the quad early on Saturdays of home games. Roll, Tide, Roll!!!"
9219,Date of experience: November 2014,27-May-15,SEC,Alabama,5,Football game,"Great seats, great game. Good was decent for a football game. People were friendly ebetehere. Enjoyed the tailgating too."
9223,Date of experience: September 2014,29-Apr-15,SEC,Alabama,4,Awesome place for Alabama football!!,"This is the place to be on Saturday when Alabama plays ""at Home"".  The atmosphere is electric.    You may have to pay more than you should for a coke and a hot dog,   But when Alabama is winning, it is pure adrenalin.  If you have never been you need to go at least once.  Parking is terrible, and expensive.   The walk to the stadium can be long, especially on a cold, or hot, or rainy day.  Watching the game on TV may be a whole lot cheaper and more convenient, but there's nothing like being in the stands.   The experience is worth the cost."
9231,Date of experience: September 2014,5-Apr-15,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide Roll,"Always a great place to hang out with 102,000 of my best friends! Many great memories made here! Can't wait to come back!"

9237,Date of experience: December 2014,5-Mar-15,SEC,Alabama,5,Best College Stadium,There is nothing like a fall Saturday at Bryant Denny. Especially when the Stadium starts shaking while everyone is singing along to Sweet Home Alabama or Dixieland Delight
9238,Date of experience: September 2014,24-Feb-15,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide Roll All Day Long!,I have been to countless home games here at BDS and it never gets old going to a game.  It's an electric environment at an SEC game.  I love that the fans participate in the cheers and songs that the band play as much as the cheerleaders!  Roll Tide!
9239,Date of experience: November 2014,18-Feb-15,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide!,"I attended the 2014 Iron Bowl between the University of Alabama Crimson Tide and the Auburn Tigers. The is absolutely no better college football atmosphere anywhere. The stadium is monstrous, and the crowd is raucous."
9240,Date of experience: November 2014,18-Feb-15,SEC,Alabama,5,ROLL TIDE!,Obviously picking the right game is key but Bryant-Denny stadium is a fantastic venue. I have attended games since it had only one upper deck and the pro style upgrades in the last decade and growth to over 100k makes it an awesome experience. Plus no one plays football like BAMA.
9242,Date of experience: November 2014,22-Jan-15,SEC,Alabama,5,Beautiful place!,"I love this stadium, tons of room, lots of concessions, always have helpful people for finding your seats and what not. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed watching the Iron Bowl here!"

9245,Date of experience: September 2014,28-Dec-14,SEC,Alabama,4,What more can be said?,"The home of the Crimson Tide, what else can be said? :-) Seriously, it's hard to believe that original parts of this stadium are now 85 years old. I'd give it 5 stars if the restrooms were updated and the parking arrangements were a bit more fan friendly. Great game day atmosphere on the Quad and the blackened ribeye sandwich is a must!"
9246,Date of experience: November 2014,26-Dec-14,SEC,Alabama,5,Exceeded all expectations,"I travel all over the country going to college and professional sports events and I have never been to a stadium with the atmosphere on game day like here at Bryant Denny Stadium.

9249,Date of experience: September 2014,2-Dec-14,SEC,Alabama,5,Home of Champions,"There's nothing quite like the atmosphere of a football game at Bryant Denny stadium. The Bryant part of its name refers to the legendary Coach ""Bear"" Bryant whose trademark houndstooth hat is worn bu many fans."
9250,Date of experience: November 2014,1-Dec-14,SEC,Alabama,5,2014 Iron Bowl,I took as oldest son to the 2014 Iron Bowl as a reward for his upcoming college graduation.

9251,Date of experience: November 2014,24-Nov-14,SEC,Alabama,3,Homecoming 2014,"Nice people - surprised at the amount of corporate advertising throughout the game.  Seats were a bit narrow.  Otherwise, good time."
9252,Date of experience: November 2014,24-Nov-14,SEC,Alabama,5,Best College Football period.,"Bryant Denny Stadium is a true historical landmark for Alabama football.  Expanded to over 102,000 seats gives the Crimson Tide a true home field advantage.  Plenty of food vendors and restrooms to make the football game experience complete.

9262,Date of experience: September 2014,3-Nov-14,SEC,Alabama,5,No place like it on earth,"If you love college football, there is one stadium you need to experience in your lifetime. The home of the Crimson Tide football team, Bryant Denny Stadium comes alive on Saturdays in the fall like no other venue of it's type. The tradition has been led by coaches like Gene Stallings, Paul ""Bear"" Bryant and the current top coach in America, Nick Saban. These leaders, the amazing fans, the Million Dollar Band, the Crimsonettes and Big AL combine to set the stage for excitement. The Crimson Tide boasts generations of great players such as Joe Namath, Mark Ingram, Julio Jones and curretly Blake Sims paired with the amazing Amari Cooper. Words cannot describe the experience fans and onlookers are privy to when visiting Bryant Denny. There is no other place like it on earth."
9263,Date of experience: October 2014,3-Nov-14,SEC,Alabama,4,Not Just Stadium Food,"The University of Alabama has upgraded its concessions big time. Besides the normal 'stadium dogs', which I like; there are various local restaurants who cater their normal menu, including Dreamland BBQ. Like any stadium, the prices are going to be a bit high but the food is good. UA also went to digital menus and there are big screen TV at every concession stand so you can keep up with the action on the field while you wait in line."
9264,Date of experience: November 2013,27-Oct-14,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide,"This review may be a little biased considering I am an Alabama fan, but game day at BDS can't be beat! Everything from the pregame activities to the actual game is top notch. I would go every week if I could. If you are a college football fan, this stadium is a must!"
9265,Date of experience: October 2014,23-Oct-14,SEC,Alabama,4,A bucket-list football experience,Every college football fan must see at least one game here.

9267,Date of experience: October 2014,21-Oct-14,SEC,Alabama,5,SEC Football at it's Best!,This is a beautiful stadium to enjoy watching The University of Alabama perform their magic on the field.

Great site lines, comfortable seating and a sound system you can actually hear without being blown out if your seat. The walk of fame that highlights the achievements of such a storied football program was very impressive as well as the bronze statues of all of the past national champion coaches. A school that had a proud football history and shows it with a lot of class"
9271,Date of experience: November 2013,3-Oct-14,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide,What a great college football experience.  There is no better atmosphere.  Night games are absolutely the best.  Visit the Quad before the game and drink  Yellowhammer at Gallettes.
9272,Date of experience: September 2014,22-Sep-14,SEC,Alabama,5,"Much Respect, Bama","As a hard core Gator fan, I'm conditioned to despise other SEC schools. Well, I have to give props to the Alabama football fans and the game day experience I just thoroughly enjoyed. I traveled with my wife and several friends to Tuscaloosa last Friday, in order to watch my Gators take on the Tide. While heading to the university from Birmingham, I was initially convinced that my fears were well justified. Candidly, Tuscaloosa is a dump, consisting primarily of fast food restaurants, strip malls, and used car lots. In short, it was precisely what I thought it would be. That is, until I got to the campus and the scene along University Ave. The area is quite nice and the campus is impressive. The fraternities and sororities are spectacular, even if the houses all appear to be designed by the same architect and are, frankly, a bit over the top. We enjoyed lunch at Mugshots, and later enjoyed several very good bars and restaurants over the weekend, including Gallette's, Buffalo Phil's, and for a very nice dinner, Kozy's Restaurant.  And the fans. With few exceptions, all were courteous and welcoming. We struck up several conversations with Alabama alumni and students and enjoyed meeting them immensely. Even after Bama put a beat down on Florida, we were playfully teased instead of cruelly taunted. Well done, Alabama fan.  You both had the clearly superior football team and managed to act with class. We appreciated it, and hope to see you in Gainesville."
9273,Date of experience: September 2014,21-Sep-14,SEC,Alabama,5,Home of National Champions,"Great place to watch a college football game.  Not a bad seat in the stadium.  However, early games of the season can get really warm in the stadium.  Wear suntan lotion and hydrate well.  Ladies beware: purses can not be larger than a sheet of paper, that is 8.5 x 11 inches.  Roll Tide!"
9274,Date of experience: September 2014,21-Sep-14,SEC,Alabama,5,Best football venue ever!,"Great seating, tailgating, atmosphere. Got to come here at least once in your life.  Good concessions, safe place without a lot of cursing."

9278,Date of experience: September 2014,14-Sep-14,SEC,Alabama,5,Back to play in alumni band,"It's always an adventure to attend an Alabama football game. The current stadium sits over 100,000 fans and is usually packed. There are some great seats, and there are those we get which are very high and steep. If you take the steps, it's the equivalent of 8 floors plus (yesterday) 25 rows up. Of course, you can get better seats if you are willing to pay. Fans at the game are always fun."
9279,Date of experience: September 2014,11-Sep-14,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll tide,"If you have never been to an Alabama game, you are in for a huge shock. Here really aren't words to describe Gameday on the University of Alabama campus. Plan to stay all day and make lots of friends because we love everyone in Alabama colors here!"
9280,Date of experience: November 2013,9-Sep-14,SEC,Alabama,3,Pricey food,"Since we live in the town of the Crimson Tide,.going to ballgames at Bryant Denny is a treat but eat before going!!  I do like their hotdogs and you have to get a hotdog but the food is pricey!!"
9281,Date of experience: September 2014,6-Sep-14,SEC,Alabama,5,Everyone should visit at least once!,"The football experience is amazing. Tailgate activities, games, vendors etc extend 360 degrees around the stadium for hours before the game begins. Easy walking, adjacent roads are closed allowing for easy and safe pedestrian traffic. Lots of helpful and friendly police and event staff make this chaos well organized, safe and fun.  The enthusiasm that the community has for the school and the football program is contagious!  A beautiful well designed stadium. Not a bad seat anywhere....even up high in the end zone student section the view is beautiful and the crowd is lively. Plenty of clean easily accessible bathrooms and concessions.   Concession lines are long, but wall mounted tvs are around so fans don't miss the action. Short walk to The Strip for post game restaurants and shopping.  Any kind of food you can imagine is available here."
9283,Date of experience: November 2013,18-Aug-14,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide Roll,"Without a doubt, one of the best places to attend a college football game at, period. A great electric atmosphere, the pomp and pageantry of the bands, it doesn't get much better than this. Again, Roll Tide!!!"
9289,Date of experience: October 2013,30-Jun-14,SEC,Alabama,5,Better than most pro teams' stadiums. Awe inspiring.,"Watching a Crimson Tide game at Bryant Stadium in Tuscaloosa took my breath away. The cheering crowds. The million dollar marching band. The outstanding football team. Good, clean fun."

9292,Date of experience: September 2013,17-Jun-14,SEC,Alabama,5,RTR! Roll Tide Roll,What a fun game and stadium to attend. The fans are crazy and know how to have a good time. The only thing that surprised me when we arrived in the stadium was that most of the sections were bleachers rather bucket seats. If you do not want to sit on the hard bleacher the entire time you can rent chairs that attach to the bleachers or bring your own seat pad.
9294,Date of experience: November 2013,3-Jun-14,SEC,Alabama,5,Jimmy's Review,"I think Bryant Denny stadium is an excellent facility.  Being a Tide Pride member I attend all of Alabama's football games.  I am fortunate that my seats are convenient to get to - only six rows up, close to bathrooms and concessions.  Bryant Denny is huge, 104,000 seats that are comfortable and all have a great view.  We have many boxes (all are sold) plus endzone boxes (also sold out) that are wonderful to watch the games. The outside has an area where all of the coaches who have won national championships have a statue in their honor which is very impressive.  I would say that the U of A has no equal when it comes to football stadiums."
9297,Date of experience: October 2013,6-May-14,SEC,Alabama,5,ROLL TIDE!,"I love this place.  I've never had a bad time at this stadium, except when Bama loses, which is not often.  The restrooms could use a little updating.  A lot of history and tradition in Tuscaloosa."
9298,Date of experience: November 2013,5-May-14,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide,"I love this atmosphere and this is the best stadium in the SEC.  We have visited many others and found this to be the best, even in the upper levels the view is unobstructed and easy to make your way to restrooms and concessions."
9301,Date of experience: November 2013,16-Apr-14,SEC,Alabama,5,Walk of Champions is a must see,For a football fan this stadium is excellent. The walk of champions is a must see   The statues of the Natioal Championship coaches are great.  Get ther early because it get extremely crowded before the team arrives

9305,Date of experience: October 2013,30-Nov-13,SEC,Alabama,5,One of the most beautiful stadiums,We go to the stadium for events as well as football games.  It is very large with multiple types of seating options.  The monitors and big screens makes viewing easy no matter where your seat is and no matter how many people are around you.  The location and surrounding area is interesting as well.

9308,Date of experience: November 2013,16-Nov-13,SEC,Alabama,3,PA system not so good,"They need to upgrade PA system, been here for several games and have yet to understand a single word. Other then that this is a nice stadium. Need more restrooms on the suite level, long way from suites to restrooms."
9309,Date of experience: October 2013,6-Nov-13,SEC,Alabama,5,Roll Tide Roll,Living in Canada it is quite amusing when we go to a game ..we are asked why do we come but my husband has been a fan because of Paul Bryant since he played school football..a great stadium..Roll Tide
9311,Date of experience: October 2013,27-Oct-13,SEC,Alabama,5,you have no idea of this energy,"No stadium on earth even comes close to Bryant Denny Stadium. Especially when you consider the great energy that is always present for an Alabama game, no matter who the opponent is."
9313,Date of experience: October 2013,14-Oct-13,SEC,Alabama,2,NOT GOOD,"My husband and I visited our freshmen daughters for Homecoming and had tickets to the football game at Bryant Denny.  They were absolutely the worse seats I have ever had for any kind of stadium event, particularly for the cost ($50.00 a piece).  As parents of two students attending the university, we believe the cost should have been less and the seat location better.  It was 100 degrees on the shade that Saturday morning and people in the upper seats (we were four rows from the top) were fainting and getting sick left and right, coming and going.  We took an elevator to the 7th floor, then walked a circular ramp twice, then had to walk up 28 flights of stairs that felt like they were leading you straight to Heaven.  It was just awful.  Fifteen minutes in, I made the decision that I will never, ever go to another game held in that stadium unless I am assured that I will have seats in a much lower row and under the canopies which are on each side of the field, but not in the end zone seats.  Additionally, I have a heart condition and I thought I was going to pass out after I finally reached our seats.  After other people starting fainting and leaving en mass, we left too right before the end of the second quarter.  Didn't care what a waste of money it was.  We were just glad to get out of there still in fairly good health."
9314,Date of experience: September 2013,14-Oct-13,SEC,Alabama,5,Wow!,"First visit to see my nephew in the million dollar band and cheer for the Tide. Great view even from from nosebleed section where we sat. Love the ramp to go to top, stairs only used to get to actual seats. Some season holders unfriendly to one gamers, but not all of us live close-by. I'd be at every game if I lived closer. Plenty of concession stands and restrooms. We were on visiting side section HH row 29. Roll Tide Roll!"
9315,Date of experience: October 2013,14-Oct-13,SEC,Alabama,4,Stadium of Champions,"Bryant-Denny Stadium is at the heart of Tuscaloosa's own UA. There are a lot of activities besides our home games and pep rallies. These activities spill out into our growing collegiate city. There is a lot of construction in T-town right now. Not only to boost the school but, also re-construction from the devastation of the April 2011 tornado. I've done construction at the stadium when the seats were expanded to fit well over 100,000. Besides, the UA has the highest freshmen enrollment in the country this year! Let me tell you, Tuscaloosa is a hotbed for scenic vacays, enthused football fans, and future students."
9316,Date of experience: October 2013,13-Oct-13,SEC,Alabama,4,Awesome,the walk of champions and Statues of  the Coaches. there is nothing I did not like. We enjoyed our visit and will return often.
9317,Date of experience: October 2013,7-Oct-13,SEC,Alabama,5,"Football in the south ""Zone""","Tickets to an Alabama football game in the South Zone was amazing.  Plenty of food and drink included!  And, if you get hot, go inside and watch it on the TV's!"
9318,Date of experience: September 2013,3-Oct-13,SEC,Alabama,5,College Football Mecca,"What a great place for a college football game.  The stadium, which seats nearly 102,000-folks, is situated nicely within beauty of the University of Alabama campus.  Crowds are loud and proud.  As is the case with most stadiums, concessions can be crowded with limited selections, but then again, I'm not there for the food.  Every football fan should have a stop at this mecca of college football on their bucket list!"
9319,Date of experience: September 2013,25-Sep-13,SEC,Alabama,5,"See a game, end of story.",After walking by and seeing games at Bryant-Denny for several years I can honestly say it ruined seeing The Bird's Nest for me.While my nonUA friends saw the nest my fellow classmate and I had to awkwardly pretend that we were impressed by The Nest.You don't understand the sheer size of Bryant-Denny until you are dissapointed by a world famous stadium.
9320,Date of experience: September 2013,19-Sep-13,SEC,Alabama,5,Superb stadium!,"What a great place for football!  Seats in upper deck via elevator. 4 jumbotrons, clean, lots of choices for good but stadium dogs are THE BEST! If you get a chance to go-  make it happen!!!"
9322,Date of experience: October 2012,13-Aug-13,SEC,Alabama,5,From a Florida gator fan living in tuscaloosa,"I am a hardcore Florida gator fan that has been loving in ttown for a long time now. This place is truly a sight to see. I love going here to watch games and just how well the stadium was built and how they added on over the years. You know when I moved here I wanted to hate bama but over the years you start to appreciate this towns obsession with this team, stadium and everything bear Bryant. I will now cheere them on unless it is hurting my team is so e way. Getting off point a little. My overview, if you are a fan of football this is a place to visit and appreciate."
9323,Date of experience: October 2012,11-Aug-13,SEC,Alabama,2,A great team & stadium,"Bryant Denny Stadium and The University of Alabama Crimson Tide rank #1 in every regard.  The stadium is ALWAYS packed and tickets sold out.  It's a tremendous venue.  Sadly if you are disabled by physical limitations in walking it is a treacherous endeavor to attend a game.  I can't fault anyone and I'm not sure anything could be done to improve the circumstances.  The disability parking is an improvement but it remains difficult to walk.  The greatest obstacle is the sheer steepness of the stadium and trying to ascend or descend rows.  You do so at great risk and physical exertion.  We are tough enough on our families without challenges when they want to enjoy a great game.  Sometimes in our better judgment watching a game in high definition on our home wide screen TVs and yelling ROLL TIDE may be the best choice.  I do not want to disparage the University in any way.  The fact remains if physically disabled careful consideration is absolutely necessary when entering crowds exceeding 100,000 excited spectators who have paid to enjoy themselves."
9324,Date of experience: September 2012,4-Aug-13,SEC,Alabama,5,A Roll Tide Tradition,This stadium is the home to the The Crimson Tide football team. The stadium has tradition and brings southern hospitality to all who visit. The entire family will have a wonderful time. The refreshments are so good. Try it out.
9325,Date of experience: August 2013,4-Aug-13,SEC,Alabama,3,Only if you're a TIDE fan,"If you are a University of Alabama football fan, you should see the stadium.  Otherwise, it's a bunch of uncomfortable seats in a bowl shape."
9328,Date of experience: October 2012,29-Jul-13,SEC,Alabama,5,Winner,The University of Alabama has a longstanding history of successful football teams. Attending a game at Bryant Denny is a truly amazing experience. I would highly recommend it.
9329,Date of experience: September 2012,29-Jul-13,SEC,Alabama,5,Awesome experience at BDS,"If you ever get a chance to attend a home football game at The University of Alabama, do it!  Incredible experience especially if it is a big game.  The atmosphere is electric.  Don't miss tailgating on the quad (center of campus) and stop in at the Houndstooth Bar before or after the game.  Plan to make a day of it because the tailgating starts early and ends late after the game."
9333,Date of experience: October 2012,19-May-13,SEC,Alabama,5,Fun Place to Catch a Game,"For Alabama fans, this place is sacred.  For the rest of the country, this place is hell.  However, if you enjoy sports and football, the stadium itself is one of the best around.  Beautiful scenery abounds, and the architecture of the stadium is amazing.  This is definitely worth a visit, and obviously great for the kids as far as family-friendly venues goes.  Oh yeah, and you can catch a great football game too :)"
9334,Date of experience: November 2012,16-May-13,SEC,Alabama,5,Rammer Jammer,"Had a blast at the game...we go to a game at least once a year and we love it everytime we go! There is nothing like the rush of seeing that stadium for the first time, except seeing heaven for the first time ha!"
9335,Date of experience: November 2012,15-May-13,SEC,Alabama,5,A must see venue,Bryant Denny is a unique stadium.  The University of Alabama managed to preserve this historic stadium and simply modernize and expand it.  You get the best of both worlds - a place where history has been made and a place with modern conveniences like fantastic jumbotrons that are visible from any seat in the house.  The Tide Pride seating is comfortable and provides ample arm room - a rarity for many large stadiums.  The skyboxes are truly amazing.  The original boxes offer windows that can be open or closed depending on the weather.  You can feel the power and history even simply approaching the stadium as you pass statutes of the national champion winning coaches.
9336,Date of experience: November 2012,11-May-13,SEC,Alabama,5,For football lovers,"Like college football?  Then don't grow old and die without seeing a game here.  It's a massive and ultra-modern stadium, hosting some of the best competition."
9338,Date of experience: October 2012,7-May-13,SEC,Alabama,5,As Good As It Gets!,Bryant Denny Stadium-Alabama football is as good as it gets! No better way to spend your Saturday than attending the game and enjoying all the pre game festivities. The atmosphere is electric and you'll never forget it. Tons of history associated with and depicted in and around the stadium. Just an awesome place to visit!
9339,Date of experience: November 2012,14-Apr-13,SEC,Alabama,5,Home Sweet Home Away From Home,"Whether you are a college football fan or not, this is a place you will want to see.  There is so much history here you can't help but feel the electricity on gameday.  And if you do go to see a game, make no mistake, this will be an all day event.  Start with a trip to Bryant Museum, walk around the campus, spend some time on the quad, but be sure to make it into the stadium a couple hours before kickoff.  But before you go in, pay a visit to the Walk of Champions, see the inscriptions, have your picture made with the statues of previous coaches, and grab a game day shirt.  On the inside, there's plenty of concessions but be sure to stop by Dreamland (a local favorite) for a pork potato and a ""healthy"" serving of banana pudding.  If the line is too long, you can opt for a pizza, some nachos, or the obligatory stadium hotdog.  Come back at half time for a pretzel and some dipping dots.  Be in your seat an hour before the game for the festivities - enjoy your meal, see the team warm up, and watch the Million Dollar Band take the field (it's impressive to see these 400+ members perform). There are several videos on the jumbo-trons that highlight history, tradition, and the legacy, including highlights of previous players, coaches, and seasons. Sit back and relax with 101,821 of your closest friends but don't get too comfortable because when it's game time, you'll have to stand and cheer for the Crimson Tide!"
9344,Date of experience: September 2012,23-Jan-13,SEC,Alabama,5,WOW! RoLL TiDe,Amazing how this stadium works like a machine. We were in and out w/ no troubles whatsoever. The concessions are pricey. But the whole CRIMSON TIDE experience was awe inspiring!

9349,Date of experience: November 2012,22-Nov-12,SEC,Alabama,5,A must fo all BAMA fans,What do you want to tell about the home of the most succesfull Football Team in the nation? Be aware that you don't see too much of the stadium fom the outside so get you some tickets and watch the Crimson Tide win their next national championship
9350,Date of experience: November 2012,21-Nov-12,SEC,Alabama,3,Nice but crowded,"Nice stadium. Area with vendors (food, drinks, and bathroom) is quite crowded. Try to avoid getting up during half time or you will be stuck in a HUGE crowd with small space !"
9351,Date of experience: November 2012,20-Nov-12,SEC,Alabama,5,Alabama Football,"The stadium is one of the biggest. All good seats. Snacks and refreshments were kind of high, and since it is a dry campus they sold no alcohol."
9352,Date of experience: October 2012,19-Nov-12,SEC,Alabama,5,Simply the best.,One of the country's largest college football stadiums and the best designed. Walk of Champions will give the Bama fan chills. Alumni who have not been back since the remodel simply must go.

While fearful for my life, I shouldn't have been. These are some of the most gracious, nicest (and genuine) football fans I've ever been around. And the noise they create at key moments is absolutely deafening. If you're a football fan, see a game here. The pre-game tailgating (in tents on the quad) is also incredible in scope."

9363,Date of experience: September 2012,5-Oct-12,SEC,Alabama,5,Awesome Stadium!!!,"This is an awesome stadium that you will experience for a college game.  I really enjoyed for my first college game and enjoyed the excitement of how loud they shout the ""Roll Tide"".  Bryant-Denny Stadium is one of the most prominent college football venues in the nation. Located on the southwestern edge of the University of Alabama campus, the history-laden stadium ranks among the nation's top 5 on-campus football stadiums with a seating capacity of 101,821 after completion of the latest expansion in the summer of 2010.  Come and enjoy the stadium and have a great time and if you do not have your ticket they have a lot of people up and down the street that sell tickets that are cheaper.

The people were very gracious and offered to help constantly. Always asking if we were having a good time etc... Also, we parked far, but there is a very convenient and efficient shuttle that ran every 20 minutes. As far as the stadium itself, for a big and older SEC stadium it did not show any signs of wear and the club level suites and press box were very impressive on the interior. The crowd was very good and the game day atmosphere was top notch. We enjoyed our visit and hope to play you guys again soon."

9397,Date of experience: November 2011,3-May-12,SEC,Alabama,5,absolutely the best venue for college football!,the absolute best college football stadium.  (I've seen most of the others) even outranks most bowl venues.  great place to see a game.
9398,Date of experience: November 2011,1-May-12,SEC,Alabama,5,Dixie's Football Pride,"I am obviously very biased because I am a '97 graduate of the University of Alabama; however, since I have been going to games at BDS since 1993, I can attest to how far this stadium has come in the last 19 years.While BDS has always been an incredible stadium, it was not the largest or most modern to see games at until the recent renovations.  Starting with the addition of the second Upper Deck, then the first end zone completion (with the awesome Zone section), then finally the completion of the bowl and the second Zone, BDS is now one of the largest and most accomodating venues in all of college football.Not only have the concessions and the amenities been upgraded in the last decade, but the addition of the Walk of Champions has added the true testament to the place in college football history that BDS deserved.You will not find a more gracious and accomodating fan base and tailgating environment in the entire SEC.  It is truly a first-come-first-serve, and there are lots of free games for the kids, pep rallies on the Quad, restrooms, and lots of great food to be found.My only complaint is the difficulty in finding nearby parking; however, if you are willing to pay $15-20, you can get within a 5-10 minute walk with no fear for your vehicle.  Tuscaloos PD has done a much better job in the last couple of years to accommodate the larger crowds and to direct pre-game (and more importantly post-game) traffic.Whether you are cheering for the Tide or visiting to cheer on your team, you will most certainly enjoy your visit to BDS (even if the Tide Rolls!!)."

9415,Date of experience: September 2011,3-Jan-12,SEC,Alabama,5,"Nice stadium - even though it's huge, doesn't feel like it",We didn't feel cramped in our seats and the fact that you can walk down and stand next to the field at any time is a huge plus.  I have been to games at other universities and you never get to do this.  Bathrooms were close - just very easy.
9416,Date of experience: November 2011,20-Nov-11,SEC,Alabama,5,Top notch stadium,Plenty of food stalls and bathrooms.  We wandered around a bit and didn't see a bad seat in the house.  Great time.

Note: With ongoing construction, getting to reserved parking can be a challenge. Give yourself time to be detoured every which way possible."
9421,Date of experience: November 2019,13-Nov-19,SEC,Arkansas,4,Had a great time!,Our son transferred in this year and we went to a couple of games.  Nice and clean. Great views except we wish our ticket choice the second time we bought had mentioned obstructed view.  We were in the first row in an upper deck and the stair railing partially blocked my view...not terrible but just a bit.  I still enjoyed it though.  Reasonable prices.  Will definitely go to many more games in the future.
9422,Date of experience: November 2019,12-Nov-19,SEC,Arkansas,5,University of Arkansas Football stadium,"We have season football tickets so we enjoy the stadium multiple times a year. There is a cool razorback statue the North side of stadium near the ""Pit"" parking lot. Also, a statue of former and legendary Athletic Director/Coach Fran Broyles near the Hog Store on the North side. The stadium holds nearly 80K people and has 2 huge jumbo trons, and real grass field."
9423,Date of experience: November 2019,5-Nov-19,SEC,Arkansas,5,Home With The Razorbacks!,"DWRRS facility has been recently renovated/added on to and is wonderful for the fan experience from top to bottom. Individual game experience surveys via timely email have been added and believe it or not that are reacting to fan inputs between games??-unheard of in the past. Food prices are reasonable, lines realigned and quality/choice have been improved."
9424,Date of experience: October 2019,20-Oct-19,SEC,Arkansas,5,Nice stadium,"I went to the Arkansas-Auburn football.  The people who run the stadium and do the customer service are solid.  Arkansas has been dealing with football crowds for a long time and it shows.  The parking is simple, go park at the baseball stadium and take a short bus ride up there.  The food selections are pretty good.  I had Slim Chickens in the stadium.  The pizza also looked good.  The food is reasonably priced compared to other stadiums.  My souvenir soda was $4.  The stadium staff and gameday staff was incredibly helpful when I figured out I had left my keys in my car.  They told me how to get back to my car quickly.  I found a ticket on the street to get back in for five bucks.  I only missed 1/2 a quarter of game action which still blows my mind.  I had a great day watching football in NW Arkansas."
9425,Date of experience: August 2019,11-Aug-19,SEC,Arkansas,5,Checking out the stadium !!!!,When ever we are in a city that has a college stadium. We have to visit. We could view from the outside. Their gift shop was open.

9431,Date of experience: November 2018,13-Nov-18,SEC,Arkansas,5,Razorback Football,A season ticket holder I have been to the stadium many times.  Great views regardless of where you sit in the stadium.  No alcohol available in the stadium. The only thing that would be better is for the Razorbacks to win more.
9432,Date of experience: November 2018,11-Nov-18,SEC,Arkansas,1,Razorbacks Vs. LSU,No HOT beverages in November...REALLY?  Who is in charge to make that stupid mistake?  Plus had to wait in line forever before getting to front to learn they had nothing hot to drink.  This is all BEFORE halftime.  Other reviews indicate this problem before kickoff.
9433,Date of experience: December 2017,5-Nov-18,SEC,Arkansas,5,Always a great time routing for our Razorbacks,This is a great stadium to visit and the upgrades they have made make it easier to know whats happening in the game all the time.

Great Day!"
9435,Date of experience: October 2018,21-Oct-18,SEC,Arkansas,5,Great SEC Atmosphere,"We were here for Homecoming this year. One of my CoWorkers mom is an Alum. The atmosphere was electric. Great fans who are loyal to their Razorbacks. It was a great win over Tulsa. Boy, can these fans tailgate! We had a blast! Since my daughter now works in Fayetteville, we??ll make this an annual event!"
9436,Date of experience: October 2018,8-Oct-18,SEC,Arkansas,4,Great Staduim,The north end zone expansion makes this place really nice. The restrooms were clean when I was there are plenty of them. The two jumbotrons are nice because you can see all the replays no matter where you are sitting. Great football atmosphere.
9437,Date of experience: October 2018,6-Oct-18,SEC,Arkansas,4,Fun,Great stadium. Nice and clean   Plenty women??s restrooms. Seating is extremely close. It??s annoying as people climb over you to get in and out of their seats.
9438,Date of experience: August 2018,2-Oct-18,SEC,Arkansas,5,The South take football seriously!,I was visiting Fayetteville on gameday.  I got there early to drive around the campus. IT was fun to see people setting up their tailgates!  A lot of spirit from the Razorbacks .  It was not too bad getting around traffic in town but the freeway was lined up for miles!
9439,Date of experience: September 2018,19-Sep-18,SEC,Arkansas,4,UNT spanking,"Razorbacks vs UNTVery nice stadium, our husbands were looking for beer and we were told that the only way to purchase it was if you club seats.  We aren??t major football fans so beer wasn??t worth the trade off of $250.00 per seat."
9440,Date of experience: September 2018,17-Sep-18,SEC,Arkansas,5,Razorback Football,"This was my second visit to Razorback Stadium.  The new addition is very nice!  It was definitely hot in the sun during the game, so we didn't stay past halftime.  The stadium is very clean and water, food, drink lines were quick.  Love the fireworks after Razorbacks score!   Woo Pig Sooie!"
9441,Date of experience: September 2018,17-Sep-18,SEC,Arkansas,5,North Endzone Addition is incredible,"We were able to get tickets and sit in the new North Endzone Addition.  Before kickoff we cheered the team as they came through to run through the A.  Even though it was hot, we were able to go inside to cool off.  The food selection was varied and included free hot dogs and prime rib. The sodas were also free but the beer was reasonably priced.  With the new addition you can now walk around the entire stadium and see the other exhibits and views.  We also liked the new statue of Razorbacks at the plaza.  The team might be struggling at the moment but the stadium is ready to host some big games once Coach Morris gets things back on track."
9442,Date of experience: October 2017,2-May-18,SEC,Arkansas,5,Razorbacks football,Great stadium. Love to go to football games in Fayetteville. We have indoor club seating and see game really good. Bathrooms and concessions are both very close so you don??t miss any of the games and it??s SEC football. Doesn??t get any better. We make all the home games in Fayetteville and the town and surrounding area is very much fun.
9444,Date of experience: September 2017,9-Apr-18,SEC,Arkansas,5,1st Hog Football Trip,"I didn't particularly care for the fact that I had nose-bleed tickets. I am really scared of heights. I settled in and found the stadium view very nice. I have gone to college and professional stadiums and I really enjoyed my time. I am a former U. of Iowa student and back in the 70's the stadiums were large, but not as large as they are now. It's almost like going to a professional game when so many people are in attendance and so devoted to their team."
9446,Date of experience: November 2017,3-Dec-17,SEC,Arkansas,4,WPS FOOTBALL,"Teenage granddaughter & I had a great time cheering on the Hogs although they  were defeated by MU & the coach was fired.    Stadium is nice. Rows are entirely too close to have leg room, and to be ask to throw away a small crossover Coach bag was not anticipated.  My fault for not knowing the clear bag rule, but my bag rolled up to be smaller than my wallet & all fit nicely into one of the bags provided. But my brilliant grandone rolled it in a clear bag & put it under the stairs that went to the stadium & retrieved it upon leaving.  Food was good, lines were short (perhaps due to the dismal season record& a holiday weekend), and clean restrooms were appreciated."
9447,Date of experience: November 2017,28-Nov-17,SEC,Arkansas,4,Mizzou/Hogs 2017,"Nice stadium, easy access.  We sat in the corner next to the new suite construction & view was good.  We were midway up in the stands & you felt close to the field.  Restrooms large & clean.  We parked in free parking with shuttle service so no trouble getting to game.  Getting back was not quite as easy.  Since it was a close game everyone left at once so hundreds in line for shuttles.  We ended up walking the mile back to the parking lot.  The WooSouie chant did get a little annoying, but my team won so that's okay."
9448,Date of experience: November 2017,13-Nov-17,SEC,Arkansas,4,Trough Tough!,Wonderful experience for the family!  If you don't want to be near the speakers (that gets pretty loud) sit closer to the field or in the upper deck.
9449,Date of experience: November 2017,8-Nov-17,SEC,Arkansas,3,Outdated,"Stadium needs lots of updating.  They are currently doing some, but it looks like suites.  The general seating needs major upgrades.  The metal stairs we had to walk up were actually sagging & moving with each step.  I was a little scared walking up & down to get to our seats."
9450,Date of experience: October 2017,22-Oct-17,SEC,Arkansas,4,Nice Stadium Under Renovation,"There's not a bad stadium in the SEC West. Concourses are narrow for the traffic flow. Concessions are well priced, but lacking in selection compared to other large venues. Very clean."
9451,Date of experience: October 2017,3-Oct-17,SEC,Arkansas,5,Go hogs,The stadium is being upgraded and the concession stands are amazing! The free standing area in the end zone is fantastic and there??s not a bad seat in the place.
9452,Date of experience: September 2017,12-Sep-17,SEC,Arkansas,3,Not your typical SEC stadium,"I have gone to a lot of games at this stadium however my last experience was my least favorable.  The experience was hampered by the poor concessions offered at the stadium.  Prices are not bad but the limited selections an limited locations to purchase from for an SEC stadium was a challenge, they are remodeling so I hope as they get caught up on construction that it improves."
9453,Date of experience: November 2016,6-Sep-17,SEC,Arkansas,5,Calling those Hogs,Nothing in the world like a Razorback game!!  Stadium was incredible but getting better with 2 Jumbotrons!!Don't miss a good hog game!!
9454,Date of experience: November 2016,10-Jul-17,SEC,Arkansas,5,Historical perspective,"The stadium has undergone dramatic changes since I began going to games there as a child in early 1950's. From a small stadium seating around 30,000 to a massive structure seating almost 80,000, the atmosphere that greets the fans and players is one of high energy and home team favoring noise. Compared to some of the larger stadiums in the SEC, the venue is loud but fun to visit."
9456,Date of experience: October 2016,3-May-17,SEC,Arkansas,5,WOOOO PIG SOUIE!!!!,Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium has the greatest energy of any sports arena i have ever visited. The crowd here is electric and cannot be compared to any other NCAA fan base. Calling the HOGS is such a cool thing that characterizes the facility.
9457,Date of experience: October 2016,11-Apr-17,SEC,Arkansas,5,Classic SEC experience,"Passion, excitement, and drama, and that is just trying to find a parking spot!  After your car is parked you will be treated to a first class event at the Home of the Razorbacks."
9458,Date of experience: October 2016,12-Mar-17,SEC,Arkansas,3,hard to find seating,What a beautiful stadium but it can be extremely hard to find your seat isle and row.  Who designed this place?

9460,Date of experience: September 2016,10-Jan-17,SEC,Arkansas,5,SEC Football at its finest.,Tailgating is almost as valued as the games. Parking is segmented by ticketholder and donor status.  Open parking is available but far.  Bus shuttles available near handicap parking.
9461,Date of experience: November 2016,24-Dec-16,SEC,Arkansas,4,Football fun,"My #1 piece of advice is this:  KNOW YOUR GATE NUMBER!  What people don't realize about the stadium is that it was built piecemeal; with the upper decks basically having been built OVER the existing stadium.  As such, the upper and lower sections are independent of each other, and many of the gates are dedicated to one or the other; not both!  Far too many people rush into the first gate they can find, only to discover they can't get to where they need to go.  And since SEC rules forbid re-entry, once you're inside, you're stuck finding a stairway and navigating the labyrinth.  So KNOW YOUR GATE NUMER!  It's printed right there on your ticket.  LOOK FOR IT!My second piece of advice: check the website beforehand so you know what items you can't take into the stadium.  Every game, hundreds of people lug prohibited items from their cars miles away, only to find they get turned back at the gate.  It's amazing how many umbrellas are discarded each year; you think people would learn by now!  Backpacks, baby strollers, coolers, etc.  Check before you take it... otherwise it's a very long walk back to your car.  My third piece of advice:  Have fun, but don't come drunk... that ruins it for everyone.  Alcohol is only permitted in box clubs, not in the stands.  Save your drinking for afterward (celebrating a win or mourning a loss)... just don't subject my kids to your inebriated idiocy.  You WILL be asked to leave the stadium, or taken to jail if necessary.  Happens every year...Bonus advice:  Food.  It's expensive, so eat before you come.  If you must, however, know this: it's only fast food on the upper levels.  The good eats are downstairs at the south end-zone mezzanine.  Take the stairs at the southeast or southwest corners.  You're' welcome."
9462,Date of experience: November 2016,15-Nov-16,SEC,Arkansas,5,Love Razorback Football!,This is definitely one of the nicest college stadiums in the nation!  Razorbacks have a lot to be proud of.
9463,Date of experience: November 2016,12-Nov-16,SEC,Arkansas,3,"Love the excitement, hate the concessions","Razorback Stadium has all the fun that you would associate with a college football game- the crowds, the excitement, the traditions.  We had decent seats, getting in and out was slow and congested but that should be expected when 70,000 show up to anything.  The concessions are worthless.  I visited them three times with a hungry 10 year old, and went to different stands each time.   They are understaffed, and the staff they have is clueless.  You will wait an eternity in line only to find out they are out of multiple items.  Zero customer service.  If you are lucky enough to get something, double check their price: they tried to overcharge me twice- not intentionally, but out of pure ignorance of what the price was.  Don't go hungry and don't waste your time on stadium concessions.  You can pick up a water for cash in the stands or off a cart, and eat afterwards in a real restaurant."
9464,Date of experience: November 2016,11-Nov-16,SEC,Arkansas,5,Super fun time!!!  Lovely campus!,"Had a great time at the Razorbacks vs. Gators game, despite the horrific Gators loss.  Stadium and campus were very pretty -- loved the campus overall and was impressed w/ their athletic facilities. Stadium was impressive and very clean!!  As a visiting team fan, folks were very nice, with the exception of two rude and fairly obnoxious (aka drunk) girls directly in front of us at the game who would NOT EVER sit down despite having a perfectly clear view of the field.  Loved that the stadium serves PEPSI!!!  :-)"
9465,Date of experience: November 2016,7-Nov-16,SEC,Arkansas,5,Woo pig,I am a Georgia girl who loves the hogs.  This is the 4th time i have been to Razorback Stadium but we follow the hogs on the road. I am pleased that they have an elevator for those of us with a handicap. Our seats are in a pretty good spot and almost on the 50. We are going next Saturday for the LSU game. I will be here whenever my friends invite me. Go Hogs!
9466,Date of experience: November 2016,6-Nov-16,SEC,Arkansas,4,Nice stadium with pretty campus,"We visited the stadium for the Arkansas/Gator game. Unfortunately my Gators lost badly, but we still had a great time. We arrived about 3 1/2 hours early, and were still able to drive around the campus to see the area with little difficulty. We parked in the baseball parking lot for free, which is set up for commuter parking with a shuttle to the stadium. The shuttle going to the stadium was easy with no wait, and the buses have their own lane of travel.  However, we got turned around coming out after the game and just walked back to the lot by choice. Once outside the stadium, it is not possible to walk from one side of the stadium to the other because of a hill and set-up.  I don't know how getting back would've been on the shuttle, but it looked busy/crowded. The walk only took 15-20 minutes or so. Getting out of the parking lot was easy, and traffic flowed nicely coming and going. The stadium is pretty nice, and the prices for food and drink inside are very reasonable. If you come for a mid-day game however, there is quite a bit of sun on the visitor side most of the game.  Make sure you go to the stadium the night before a game, and see it all in red.  Very simple, but it was pretty cool to see.Coming to this area in the fall is nice with the leaves changing.  There is plenty to do around the area for a long weekend.  We personally visited the drive thru safari in Gentry, and the Wal-Mart museum in Bentonville.  We are big animal fans, so much of our day was spent at the safari.  Luckily the Wal-Mart museum is open later (10 pm for us), so we still got a couple good things in.  Bentonville has a very nice downtown and we could have easily spent more time there.  I highly recommend both of these if you are in the area.  The Crystal Bridges art museum in Fayetteville was recommended by several locals, but we did not have enough time."
9467,Date of experience: October 2016,3-Nov-16,SEC,Arkansas,5,Beautiful Stadium Located In a Gorgeous Spot,"I love Razorback Stadium. It is well designed to fit snugly into the hills of western Arkansas, and it just looks like a great place to spend a Saturday in the fall.My wife and I arrived early on a Sunday morning just after Arkansas' Saturday football loss to Auburn. No one was around, and everything was totally at peace. I exited my vehicle and took a stroll up to the stadium. It is really very attractive, and I thought to myself how proud the people of Fayetteville must be of this facility.I suppose one day it will be enlarged if that is possible in its present setting, and, if so, I ask that everyone involved please keep the beauty intact when and if the size and capacity increase.J. Randolph SmithMonroe, LA"
9468,Date of experience: October 2016,10-Oct-16,SEC,Arkansas,5,Beautiful Location,"Being an Alabama fan, I visited this stadium in 2016 when Alabama played Arkansas. Although the stadium is much smaller than Alabama's, it is beautiful. The atmosphere was great. It was very loud, especially early in the game."
9469,Date of experience: September 2016,29-Sep-16,SEC,Arkansas,4,CALLING  THE  HOGS  WAS  FUN!,"My  wife  and  I  are  traveling  to  various  college  football  stadiums  each  Labor  Day  weekend,  and  since  I  root  for  Arkansas,  we  went  to  the  Arkansas-La.  Tech  game  on  9/3/2016.  Naturally,  I  was  thrilled  to  see  Arkansas  play  in  person  ( "" WHOOOOO  PIGGGG  SOOO-EEE! ""),  but  the  stadium  itself  is  not  a  palace.   We  sat  on  the  west  side  on  a  warm  day  (those  on  the  east  side  must  have  baked  in  the  late  afternoon  sun)  in  the  upper  deck.  Bleacher  seating  is  a  bit  cramped  (no  surprise)  and  rows  are  very  long,  so  lots  of  disruption  getting  in  and  out.  Concession  stands  and  upper-deck  concourses  were  VERY  crowded  on  the  west  side.  Additionally,  we  sat  in  upper deck  Section  507 - Row  4,  and  would  NOT  have  wanted  to  sit  any  higher.......Serious  nosebleed  seats  above  us.  Hogs'  fans  love  their  Razorbacks,  but  the  planned  upgrades  to  Razorback  Stadium  as  outlined  on  the  U. of A. website  are  badly  needed!   Hogs  21,  La. Tech  20!!"
9470,Date of experience: September 2016,21-Sep-16,SEC,Arkansas,5,We love game day Saturdays at Razorback Stadium!!,All Razorback fans should experience a game at Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium.  No re-entry so you can't leave once you enter.
9472,Date of experience: September 2016,18-Sep-16,SEC,Arkansas,5,Arkansas vs. Texas State,Another year of College Football with the Razorbacks. Enjoy the atmosphere. Stadium personnel always friendly. Easy to get in and out. Area Police do a good job of traffic control. Go Hogs Go.
9473,Date of experience: November 2015,18-Sep-16,SEC,Arkansas,5,Great Visit!!,Took daughter on a college visit and watched Mississippi State play the Razorbacks.  Great stadium.  We had no problems finding our seats and the family really enjoyed the visit.

9475,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,SEC,Arkansas,4,"Nose bleed section east side, 50 yard line","We attended the UA/ Louisiana Tech football game in September.  If you attend an afternoon game, do your homework before buying seats.  Our seats were on east side, top section, facing west.  Sun was very hot and bright at 3pm.  Fortunately, we came prepared with sun hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen.  Really good view of entire field.  I liked sitting in high section because you can see the game better than sitting close to field.  Take a seat cushion.The downside:  1.  Lines to most concession stands were very, very long.  One or two lines, 20-30 people per line. Sodexo, concession contractor, needed much more staffing.2.  Elevators were small, crowded, and didn't work well.  My guest has COPD and had to stop several times walking up."
9476,Date of experience: September 2016,5-Sep-16,SEC,Arkansas,5,Always a good time!,"The stadium crew is great. There is always someone that can steer you in the right direction if you can't find your seats, looking for a particular type of food, etc. The club section is great during the first part of the season, when Arkansas games can still be brutally hot. We have outdoor club seats and we find ourselves in the indoor club cooling off at times, nice break from the heat. Alternatively, in the winter (which can get pretty cool in NWA) we can be found warming up for a couple of minutes. Best part is, you never miss any of the game. We love DWRRS. As alumni, it has a special place in my heart."

9478,Date of experience: October 2015,15-Aug-16,SEC,Arkansas,5,History,"I remember this stadium from 1950's when you could lay on the grass at  Orth end.  WOW, has it changed.  This is Razorback football holy ground."
9479,Date of experience: October 2015,10-Aug-16,SEC,Arkansas,5,Go Hogs,I am not from AR originally so I do not have the same passion for the Hogs as the locals but going to a football game her really fun!  The people are nice and the energy is amazing.
9480,Date of experience: November 2015,6-Aug-16,SEC,Arkansas,5,Outstanding college football stadium for a Razorback game at Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium,I have been attending Razorback football games for the past 55 years.  The stadium has seen vast improvement since I first started going to games.  It now looks like a finished stadium rather than the steel skeleton of a structure for decades.  It is now an appealing closed in stadium.
9481,Date of experience: October 2015,19-Jul-16,SEC,Arkansas,5,Woo Pig Sooie!,Great stadium to see a Razorback win! Great food selection and plenty of facilities. Seats are all good and the atmosphere is amazing. Exactly what you'd expect from an SEC team's football stadium!
9482,Date of experience: September 2015,12-Jul-16,SEC,Arkansas,5,Razorback Game!,Beautiful stadium with no bad seats!  Calling the hogs with fans gave me the chills. Love my Razorbacks!
9487,Date of experience: October 2015,25-May-16,SEC,Arkansas,5,Where Hog Hearts Come Home to Root & Holler,"As an Arkansas-born, lifelong Razorback fan and proud employee of the University of Arkansas my review may be a bit prejudiced. The UA campus is gorgeous year around, Old Main stands majestic and proud but Razorback stadium is what brings people in from all over the country where there is no color but RED, Southern Hospitality is practiced and Hog Fever is contagious.  Hog Fans have a need to call their Hogs wherever two or more are gathered but you need to experience The Call  and the thrill of The Call with 72,000 of your closest fans...We're all family here!  Tailgating is an all-day game-day event where creativity is encouraged and rewarded.  Campus closes to traffic and there is very limited on-campus parking for donors but buses run from a huge parking lot near the Razorback Baseball's Baum Stadium at 1255 South Razorback Rd and take you UP to the stadium and take you back DOWN to parking after the game. Please call the Razorback Ticket Center at 479-575-5151 with any specific accessibility need in advance of your event to enable us to serve you better.  Y'all Come and stay awhile!"
9488,Date of experience: January 2016,17-May-16,SEC,Arkansas,5,A beautiful Stadium,The campus was beautiful and we experience snow in January.  We cannot wait to experience a football game in the Fall.
9489,Date of experience: October 2015,16-May-16,SEC,Arkansas,5,Razorback Football..'.nuff said!,"Absolutely GREAT place to watch SEC football.  From the ""runnin' through the ""A"""" to callin' them Hogs, to the food....OH the food!  Whatever else you do in NW Arkansas, make time to attend a Razorback football game.  GO HOGS!"
9491,Date of experience: September 2015,2-May-16,SEC,Arkansas,5,This is the time I went to Donald w. Reynolds stadium.,"It was great getting to learn more about the stadium in Fayetteville. I didn't just like the stadium, I liked everything I've seen in Fayetteville."
9493,Date of experience: October 2015,25-Apr-16,SEC,Arkansas,5,Them Hogs,Always Enjoy My Trip to Fayetteville to see the Hogs.  The Stadium is nice and the Employees are very outgoing and polite. Never had a rude person or a bad experience at  DWR Razorback Stadium.
9495,Date of experience: November 2015,21-Apr-16,SEC,Arkansas,4,Spend the afternoon calling the Hogs!!!,This is a great place to watch a football game.  There is not a bad seat in the lower section.  The huge screen is great for watching the replays.  The concessions are varied and priced normal for this type of venue.
9497,Date of experience: November 2015,23-Mar-16,SEC,Arkansas,5,An outstanding SEC football venue,"From the excellent amenities to the lively atmosphere, this SEC venue is a fun place to enjoy a college football game.  Also, do not miss the tailgate before the game.  You will find thousands of passionate fans preparing for the day's game."
9498,Date of experience: November 2015,20-Mar-16,SEC,Arkansas,4,Not a bad seat in the house,We attended 3 games last season and the seats were all over the place.  It's a great venue and a fun time (except when the Hogs lose!).
9499,Date of experience: October 2015,24-Feb-16,SEC,Arkansas,5,Go Hogs!,The stadium is a great place. Always clean and plenty of restrooms available from most seating places. It's a gorgeous view from the higher seats and always a good view of the game!
9500,Date of experience: October 2015,24-Feb-16,SEC,Arkansas,5,Awesome,There is know other place as great as this stadium than the Razorbacks. This is a great college and setting in a beautiful area. Lot of mountains and great views. Very awesome school spirit. If you have never been there then you are missing it.
9501,Date of experience: November 2015,16-Feb-16,SEC,Arkansas,4,Home of the Razorbacks!,"What other place than the Razorback Stadium to see all the live action for the games!The stadium will be undergoing a great multi-million dollars renovation to add more seats and improve the overall game experience.If you are a Razorback fan, this is mecca!Go Hogs!!!!"
9502,Date of experience: November 2015,3-Jan-16,SEC,Arkansas,5,Great atmosphere!!,Love going to the Hog games here! The only issue: my husband had an injury and had trouble walking. The stadium has LOTS of stairs and it is up a big hill! The stadium could use more handicapped parking.!
9503,Date of experience: November 2015,13-Dec-15,SEC,Arkansas,4,Love this stadium,"We went to an Arkansas game in November.  Stadium is easy to get around, once you find a parking spot (that's a whole different story).  Parking is almost impossible, unless you park 6+ hours before the game).  Almost all the homes in the surrounding neighborhoods have paid parking in their yards... prepared to pay a minimum of $20 and WALK a decent distance.  AND plan for a LOT of time to get out AFTER the game.  Lots of food options inside the stadium. Looks like there probably isn't a bad seat in the place."
9504,Date of experience: November 2015,3-Dec-15,SEC,Arkansas,5,Beautiful stadium - even from the outside!,"Stadium worthy of the SEC - best rivalries in football. Large stadium and you would be well advised to bring along your binoculars if you are in the top layer of seats. If you are in town and can't get a ticket to a sold out game, you can actually see it from outside on the north end of the stadium. But, try to get a ticket and enjoy the ambiance of an SEC football game.  Tailgating is fun, too. Come early and don't miss the excitement."
9505,Date of experience: November 2015,24-Nov-15,SEC,Arkansas,5,Great stadium,This was my first trip to watch a Razorback home game even though I've been a fan all of my life. I have to say that the experience was amazing. Friendly people and staff. Made you feel like a local.
9506,Date of experience: November 2015,18-Nov-15,SEC,Arkansas,5,Parents weekend,"This is an experience that everyone should have at least once.  The Razorbacks put on quite a show.  Warning if you are not a season ticket holder you will be in the nosebleed seats and it is quite a hike both up and down.  And the line for the bus to the parking lot is a long one!  Moving 70,000 people is a logistical nightmare but it is done without incident. You have to to have patience, but it was a lot of fun!"
9507,Date of experience: September 2015,16-Nov-15,SEC,Arkansas,3,Average Collegiate Stadium,"Your typical SEC stadium, but difficulty with elevator access. My mother is not handicapped but does have a bad hip, and we had to practically fight and negotiate to get her a lift up to our seats."
9508,Date of experience: October 2015,2-Nov-15,SEC,Arkansas,4,WDE!!!!!,Road tripped it to watch the Tigers play the Razorbacks. Enjoyed every minute. We had a great time. The fans were great and treated us with respect. The food in the stadium was great. Parking was very easy and at a reasonable price we were able to park very close to the stadium for $20. We were in a deck.
9509,Date of experience: September 2015,1-Nov-15,SEC,Arkansas,5,Home of the Razorbacks!,"Have been going to games here for 20 years.   Lots of improvements over the years.   Have had season tickets in the red zone for 17 years.  Great amenities, food court shopping and there isn't a bad seat in the place.   Go Hogs!!"
9510,Date of experience: October 2015,28-Oct-15,SEC,Arkansas,4,Another nice stadium in the SEC,"I came here with my family and friends for the Auburn/Arkansas game (War Eagle.)  Although, Auburn lost, I still had a great time here.  The atmosphere and pageantry are nice like most other college games I have been to.  The fans were also very nice and hospitable towards visitors.  Highly recommend visiting if your team plays here."
9511,Date of experience: October 2015,26-Oct-15,SEC,Arkansas,5,Auburn v. Arkansas - 2015 - 4 OT's!!!,"Arkansas, upon admission to the SEC, has really stepped up their game and the investment in their athletic physical plant is plainly evident.  The only down side was that the Wi-Fi system is non-existent..."
9512,Date of experience: September 2015,22-Sep-15,SEC,Arkansas,4,Razorback football - 'nuff said :),"A great stadium for watching Razorback football.  I was a bit nervous about sitting on the side facing west as I was afraid we'd scorch in the sun, but luckily it was a late afternoon game, so we got to watch a beautiful sunset over the stadium and the mountains.  We sat in the upper deck and many people who were up higher than me complained about the bugs once the sun went down and the lights came on.  I was in the lower section of the upper deck and didn't have that problem.  I didn't find the signage particularly great.  It also appeared that there were just a few elevators taking people to the upper deck - I took the stairs (which was a good decision, but it was much higher than I thought when I set off - so keep that in mind, if you take the stairs.Beer is only sold in the certain sections, so if you want to drink while watching the game, you might want to make sure you buy a ticket in those sections."
9513,Date of experience: September 2015,13-Sep-15,SEC,Arkansas,5,First visit and we loved it!,"My wife and I will be the first to admit we are not huge sports fans but we both had a great time at this game. We went with friends for a birthday celebration and enjoyed every minute of it. The fans are great and take their football seriously and everyone was very friendly. We had the chance to tailgate with a couple of different groups and the tents went on forever. The stadium, field, and scoreboard all look great. We drove around the night before and the scoreboard was lit up all red making the whole thing have a red glow about it. We had dinner and walked around Dixon street the night before the game and Woo Pig Sooie was alive and well. Great fun!! I would come back for a game in a heartbeat!!"
9514,Date of experience: September 2015,9-Sep-15,SEC,Arkansas,5,Woooo Pig Sooie!,Wooooooooooooo Pig Sooie! This is a must visit for Fall football. The stadium rocks with Razorback energy and Hog fans. A very nice facility. Much more inviting when the temp is under 80 degrees!
9515,Date of experience: August 2015,9-Sep-15,SEC,Arkansas,5,Nothing better than Razorback Football,A great venue for watching Razorback Football.  Concessions are reasonable and even if you have nosebleed seats the view is great
9517,Date of experience: November 2014,20-Jun-15,SEC,Arkansas,4,LSU Game 2014,Amazing place to attend a football game and to have a great time.  The atmosphere is usually electric and I highly recommend going to a game there!
9519,Date of experience: November 2014,23-May-15,SEC,Arkansas,5,Great venue for football,No other place rocks more than Razorback stadium on game day. Around 80k plus fans will be calling the hogs. I actually prefer my seats to be a little higher even on the top levels. If you don't want to take a chance on the weather the south end zone club is the place. It has a good selection of food plus beer and wine. Of course you will pay ball park prices. If you want to attend a game order your tickets early. Most of the time you can buy tickets outside the game.  You will be taking a chance in seat location. Be aware scalping is illegal so don't pay more than face value. Parking is at a premium. There are some private homes who sell spaces usually for $20 to $25. Fayetteville High School band sells spaces which is about  3/4 a mile from the stadium. I believe they charge about $15. The high school is located SE of the stadium.
9521,Date of experience: January 2015,30-Jan-15,SEC,Arkansas,5,Woo Pig Sooie!,"Even if you're not a Hogs fan, this is a great place for college football. I've been able to sit in A-club seats, and I've sat in the nosebleed but no matter where you are you're still going to have a great time!My advice is to take the shuttle bus if you're having to park far out, and be sure to get there early to tailgate!"
9522,Date of experience: November 2014,23-Nov-14,SEC,Arkansas,5,So much fun!,"So, really this is about the experience of a good Razorbacks game, not the stadium. Regardless of whether or not you're a fan of the team, if you enjoy football this is a great environment to see a game. Good fans, tradition, cheers, and SEC football. What's not to like?If you're from out of town, look into tailgating in the gardens. When buying tickets be aware that there are some seats that are in a glassed off area of the stadium. You'll stay comfortable in these seats, but you'll be cut off from the noise and energy of the crowd which is (in my opinion) the fun of being there. Go Hogs!"
9523,Date of experience: November 2014,18-Nov-14,SEC,Arkansas,5,Home of the Hogs,"Great atmosphere, SEC football, fall afternoons/evenings for football. Gigantic scoreboard, food court, east side better public areas, displays of Razorback football history. WPS!"
9524,Date of experience: October 2014,7-Nov-14,SEC,Arkansas,5,Home of the Razorbacks,"I highly recommend catching a game at RRS.  Get together with 70,000+ of your closest friends, and call those Hogs each fall at this amazing facility."
9525,Date of experience: September 2014,3-Oct-14,SEC,Arkansas,5,WPS!,"Love my Razorbacks and this amazing stadium! Views are great almost anywhere you sit, it's easy to navigate and safe."
9526,Date of experience: September 2014,21-Sep-14,SEC,Arkansas,5,Seating Is Cramped!!,"Only chairback seats are in the end zone or 4-5 rows in the upper decks.  Upper deck benches are CRAMMED together so there is literally no knee (not leg, but knee) room and if you're of average size you need to get used to the person behind you having their foot up your butt, knees in your back as there is nowhere else for them to go."
9527,Date of experience: October 2013,12-Sep-14,SEC,Arkansas,5,Great game day exp!,"As a USM alum I took the family to the USM/Arkansas game.  Needless to say the kids loved everything about the stadium and game day experience. Now they are also Arkansas fans so we have to go to an Arkansas game, as well as, a USM game every year."
9528,Date of experience: September 2014,8-Sep-14,SEC,Arkansas,5,Go Hogs Go,"Lots of great places to eat in the stadium but you're there to watch football, the marching band is pretty good"
9530,Date of experience: September 2013,29-Apr-14,SEC,Arkansas,5,Awesome way to spend a day or night watching my Hogs Play.,"Overall experience is incredible. Everything you need from concessions to Hog Heaven Store is really just steps away. Just Good Clean Fun. After the Hogs Win, it's even better. WPS"
9531,Date of experience: November 2013,23-Apr-14,SEC,Arkansas,5,GO HOGS!,One of the most beautiful college stadiums I've ever been to.  Clean and well managed.  Tailgating is SO much fun surrounding this gorgeous stadium.  Go Hogs!
9532,Date of experience: October 2013,12-Jan-14,SEC,Arkansas,5,Great facility for football,My wife and I have gone to Razorback football games since we were undergraduates in 1969.  With the donation from Donald W. Reynolds Foundation to expand and modernize the stadium it looks like a stadium now.  You have a fa??ade covering the once exposed steel girders underpinning the stands which makes the stadium's appearance much more finished.  It is now an impressive place to attend a college football game.
9533,Date of experience: October 2013,17-Dec-13,SEC,Arkansas,5,Great Home for the Hogs,Pig Swooie Razorbacks!  The home of the Hogs ( they stayed in the mud pool this season)!  What a place to catch some good college football.  A facility that has it all.  Seats are great and the views are easy from anywhere in the stadium.
9534,Date of experience: October 2013,28-Oct-13,SEC,Arkansas,5,Best Place in America to watch a college football game.,This stadium is what college football is all about.  I love the layout of the stadium and all seats have a great view.  The Razorback crowds make this a special place to watch a college football game.
9535,Date of experience: September 2013,6-Oct-13,SEC,Arkansas,5,Football game,"Great atmosphere, and we watched the Razorbacks win!  The crowd is enthusiastic and you are surrounded by a sea of red.  The stadium is quite modern and well maintained."
9536,Date of experience: September 2013,6-Oct-13,SEC,Arkansas,5,Fun game,"We loved it. The Razorbacks were all very nice to us Aggies. It was a lot of fun. The stadium offers Pepsi products for drinks. They also have regular concessions as well as funnel cakes and corny dogs,"
9537,Date of experience: September 2013,2-Oct-13,SEC,Arkansas,3,Decent stadium,"Attended a recent game at Razorback Stadium with friends. The stadium is located on the edge of campus. It's scenic from the upper deck, but the angle makes viewing the near sideline challenging. The large video screen (a/k/a Frank's Drive-in) provided good replays and the standard entertaining the crowd shots. The audio system was loud, but not overpowering. It was raining on our visit and the painted steps on the upper deck seemed somewhat slick. While we were seated in bleachers, they were not quite as crammed together as some venues I've attended. One end was accessible by stairs only while the other used a ramp system. Food and beverage selections were limited and about average in price. Bathrooms on the upper level were adequate, but small.The traffic situation after the game was bad, but it only lasted about an hour and a half. Plan on hanging out at a tailgate afterwards and wait it out.The ""Woo Pig Sooie"" yell is interesting and cool to see in person. UoA has a family of mascots, an inflatable mascot and the live mascot, Tusk. The stadium contains a Razorback store for souvenirs on the first level and has a number of plaques and statues of famous former players.This is a typical, smallish SEC stadium."
9538,Date of experience: September 2013,1-Oct-13,SEC,Arkansas,2,Poor stadium,"Asked for an elevator pass, then had to walk across stadium to get to the elevator, and it was a service elevator that you had to find an attendant to call for the elevator.  Bathrooms were dark.  Food service people didn't know the prices of anything. Before the game, there was music playing so LOUD. Just disappointed in my first/last visit."
9539,Date of experience: August 2013,3-Sep-13,SEC,Arkansas,5,Game Day,"Great place to catch a Razorback game.  If you are a fan of the Razorbacks or college football in general, you must see at least one game here.  The stadium is 75 years old and does show signs of age accordingly but they have continued to try to update the stadium to keep it fresh and appealing and modern.  We love Razorback Stadium and we love our hogs."
9540,Date of experience: September 2012,11-Dec-12,SEC,Arkansas,5,Razorback Heaven!,All you could ever want to see and know about the history of the Arkansas Razorbacks. This place is beautiful and very educational at the same time! A must see! Totally free!
9541,Date of experience: September 2019,29-Sep-19,SEC,Auburm,5,Auburn Should be Nicer,"Perhaps the best gameday atmosphere I??ve seen, but is easily the most dated stadium in the SEC West. Chairbacks and premium seating are essentially non-existent. Still, that??s part of what makes it special....sort of a time warp as far as SEC Stadiums go."
9542,Date of experience: September 2019,17-Sep-19,SEC,Auburm,5,First Auburn Game!,"This was our first Auburn game.  We went with some friends who are alumni and season ticket holders.  This is quite an experience!  Very nice staff, good food, good seats and dedicated fans. Had our picture taken with the cheerleaders and sent to all my buddies.  Saw the eagle enter the stadium which was really cool.  This was a night game which also enhanced the experience.  Bathrooms are spacious and clean."
9543,Date of experience: September 2019,15-Sep-19,SEC,Auburm,5,Don't miss the War Eagle Flight prior to kickoff,"While I'm an Alabama graduate, my kids go to Auburn. Great football venue with a true hometown feel. Make sure to arrive prior to kickoff to see War Eagle VII, a golden eagle named Nova, along with Spirit, a bald eagle, perform the War Eagle Flight before all Auburn home games. I don't care where you went to college, this is pretty spectacular. Also, you may be treated to a blue and orange sunset."
9544,Date of experience: September 2019,9-Sep-19,SEC,Auburm,5,Great SEC Football venue,"Had a blast with the Tigers at Jordan Hare Stadium.  The restrooms are clean and plenty of food vendors to choose from.  Seating leaves a lot to be desired, as they try to get too many in one space."
9545,Date of experience: September 2019,6-Sep-19,SEC,Auburm,5,Awesome,Awesome place to watch a game!  Went for the Auburn vs Tulane game.  Stadium is modern and clean.  You can tour the locker rooms and get on the field from 4-6pm the night before a game.

9547,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Jul-19,SEC,Auburm,5,A Place for Great Memories,Seen some amazing things at this venue. The games in September are really hot so wear a hat and sunscreen.
9550,Date of experience: November 2018,11-Dec-18,SEC,Auburm,5,Quite an Institution,Jordan-Hare Stadium is more than a Football Stadium. It??s an Auburn Institution! Going to an Auburn Game there is a ??Right of Passage?? for many generations.
9551,Date of experience: December 2018,10-Dec-18,SEC,Auburm,5,Great Place to Experience Football,This past week Auburn hosted the Alabama High School Football State Championships over 3 days. This is a great location to host high school athletes and their families and introduce them to Auburn University. I have been attending games here for many years and always enjoy the beauty of campus and the game day experience.
9553,Date of experience: November 2018,6-Nov-18,SEC,Auburm,5,"Where 87,451 friends meet","A great environment to see a football game! The university improves the experience every year a little bit. They really make it easy to have a good time. Tip: Friday??s before game day, visit the locker new rooms between 4-6pm - gate 10.Tip: bring en empty water bottle. You. An fill it up inside on several watering stations. A bottle of water is only $2 if you forget or cups are freeTip: upper deck has more legroom. Regardless where your actual seats are, you might want to walk upstairs and enjoy the game with some more spaceTip: if you are going to the game , be in your seat 30 min before game time. You do NOT want to miss the early circle over the stadium and landing in midfield. Every time I see the eagle fly, I get a chill down my spine in awe. Uniquely Auburn experience!"
9554,Date of experience: November 2018,6-Nov-18,SEC,Auburm,5,War Eagle!,"Great stadium with plenty of facilities and vending concessions. Although we were in the upper level, we had great seats with views of the Jumbotron."
9555,Date of experience: November 2017,31-Oct-18,SEC,Auburm,4,Football on the Plains,"Great fun and SEC experience to be had by all.  I'm not exactly a Tiger fan, but seeing the eagle soar, band marching and feeling the electricity in the air defiintely made me smile."
9556,Date of experience: October 2018,21-Oct-18,SEC,Auburm,5,Soaring like an Eagle in Jordan Hare Stadium,"A trip to the loveliest city on the Plains is not complete without a trip to Jordan Hare stadium for a football game. By far the stadium and the crowd is at its best during an SEC game (although every football game is an experience). From the opening flight of the legendary eagle from the heights of the stadium on to the field and the entry of the team through a smoke filled haze surrounded by the cheerleaders and the Auburn band until the coaches shake hands on the field after the game, this is a spectacle that has to be experienced to be understood. It is not only an athletic competition, it is a family reunion. It is a front row seat into the AUBURN psychie. If Auburn wins the toilet paper icing on the cake is the victory celebration at Toomers corner. It is loud. Everything is larger than life ?? especially the Jumbotron that literally lights the AUBURN night sky when on. Jordan Hare is an awesome place to experience SEC football. The enthusiasm for football and the  love of Auburn make for a powerful combination and a truly unique experience."
9557,Date of experience: October 2018,16-Oct-18,SEC,Auburm,5,fun atmosphere,been an auburn football fan for 34 years living in Michigan.   great atmosphere.  I stub hubbed tickets in the 6 row of the end zone.   do the tiger walk.  glad we went.
9558,Date of experience: October 2018,14-Oct-18,SEC,Auburm,5,Beautiful stadium,"You will be hard pressed to find a more idyllic location to spend your Saturday in the South watching a college football game Jordan-Hare has been upgraded over the years to be one of the most excellent facilities, not only in the SEC but in college football period."
9559,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Oct-18,SEC,Auburm,5,Great Football Venue,"We saw Auburn play Southern Mississippi here and had a great time.  With the size of the scoreboard TV, there' really not a bad seat.  It is almost all bleacher seating so you might need to bring something for back support or you can rent something for $10."
9560,Date of experience: October 2018,2-Oct-18,SEC,Auburm,5,War Eagle!,Great college stadium to watch SEC football with an AMAZING jumbo-tron and incredible traditions.  Get there early enough to see the eagle fly!
9561,Date of experience: October 2018,2-Oct-18,SEC,Auburm,5,Electrifying,"Best place to experience the SEC!!!  Never a dull moment....no seating is ""bad""People are friendly and the sounds are electrifying!!!!"
9562,Date of experience: September 2018,29-Sep-18,SEC,Auburm,5,Great Staduim and Great time,Auburn really does have a nice stadium. They have the largest or at least one of these largest jumbo trons in college football. You can see and hear from every angle. Food prices are reasonable in this type venue. Most major food and drink items seem to range from $4 to $6. They need more choices on candy but I think food and drink choices are good. The pretzel we bought was dry by the time we got one before halftime but other items were fine. It was a fun time for the family and kids especially when the War Eagle flew before the opening. The marching band is also always a fun opening. Recommend coming and having a good time at AU football.
9563,Date of experience: September 2018,26-Sep-18,SEC,Auburm,5,First time neutral fan,"Being a huge football fan i enjoy traveling to see other teams stadiums and traditions.  That being said Auburn is a great place to catch a game.  The atmosphere is incredible, pre-game is a must see and the energy in the building is electric throughout the entire game.  The stadium is extremely dated, but the atmosphere makes up for its less than perfect appearance.  Parking is very tricky and ended up walking over a mile to the stadium, i'd extremely recommend pre-ordereing a parking pass.  Wasn't a fan of either team, but its easily a top college football venue."
9564,Date of experience: September 2018,23-Sep-18,SEC,Auburm,5,WAR EAGLE!,"AUBURN Football. Great game, great seats (section 5 - row 8) and a great crowd to watch AU beat Arkansas.  What a great place and just an AUsome evening."

9566,Date of experience: September 2018,18-Sep-18,SEC,Auburm,5,"First Tigers game, loved it!","What a gorgeous campus and easy to access and find your way around the stadium. Parking seemed like it might be challenging but we bused in from a shopping plaza and loved it. Again, it was easy to get around and good views. Incrediblely hot day and ran low on water options. Would highly suggest this stadium!"
9567,Date of experience: September 2018,18-Sep-18,SEC,Auburm,3,Auburn Should be Nicer,"Perhaps the best gameday atmosphere I??ve seen, but in easily the most dated stadium in the SEC West. Chairbacks and premium seating is essentially non-existent."
9568,Date of experience: November 2017,6-Aug-18,SEC,Auburm,5,Nothing like Jordan Hare,You only have to go once to be hooked on going to the games at Jordan Hare.  Nothing like it.  The atmosphere is captivating.
9569,Date of experience: November 2017,6-Aug-18,SEC,Auburm,5,War Damn Eagle!,Jordan Hare Stadium is a wonderful place to see the Auburn Tigers play SEC football. Pregame is especially awesome when the Eagle flies around inside the stadium.
9571,Date of experience: November 2017,2-Jun-18,SEC,Auburm,5,Best college football atmosphere,"Yes I may have graduated from Auburn but I have also visited alot of other SEC, ACC and other college stadiums - Auburn is amazing the atmosphere is amazing!"
9573,Date of experience: October 2017,28-May-18,SEC,Auburm,5,Great team and great stadium,"Arrive early unless you want to park a mile away. There is paid reserved parking available, check on line."
9575,Date of experience: September 2017,8-Apr-18,SEC,Auburm,5,My Happy Place!,"Been attending games here since I was a little girl in the 70's. For years, even visiting fans have told me they love the atmosphere and the campus at Auburn. Obviously your best seat is midfield sections 4-8, but good luck getting those! If you are an Auburn Fan, you won't like sitting on the visitor's side. Even though you will probably be surrounded by Auburn fans, it's just a way different vibe. If you have to sit in the end zone, under the big screen can be a bit unnerving as it is so bright and so loud you will definitely notice! (Plus you'll feel like vernon in the stadium is looking at you!) Check the website for the clear bag policy before you go. No Umbrellas, Yes blankets to site on, no outside food. Restrooms are updates and clean with a lot of stalls so the lines aren't very long. Lot's of concessions too."
9576,Date of experience: September 2017,11-Mar-18,SEC,Auburm,5,Great Game Day Atmosphere,"I'm not from Auburn, AL, but I have attended two games at Jordan-Hare Stadium. The crowds are Tigers fanatics, but in a respectful manner. I don't think there's a bad seat in the house. And the Toomer's Corner post-game celebration is unlike any other I have seen in college football. It should be on every college football fan's bucket list!"
9577,Date of experience: October 2017,5-Mar-18,SEC,Auburm,5,JUST AUsome,"Of course I am a die hard AU fan. My heart and my money is there! We have visited other stadiums and Jordan Hare is my favorite. The wlkability to everything, the AUsome tailgates and of course the wonderful Souther Hospitality can't be beat. If you have a chance to go to a game get in early so you can see the eagle ritual it is my favorite!!"
9578,Date of experience: September 2017,25-Feb-18,SEC,Auburm,5,"All you need is a ""Second"" to See and to See is to Believe","I spent the majority of my childhood and ""young"" adulthood as a full-time Auburn (AL) resident; with that comes Auburn University Football and the icon that Jordan-Hare Stadium.  Now, aesthetically speaking ""she"" is not what ""she"" once was in/around 1987-1988, when the Stadium underwent its last ""major"" seating renovation taking it from around 70,000 to 85,000 (at which time, made it the 4th or 5th Largest College Football Stadium in the NCAA; Jordan-Hare sits around the 10th Largest Stadium, at present (closer to 88,000) but when the joint gets a jumping, the least of your/my worries is if she needs a new slab of paint and/or new Luxury Boxes (which are very nice, as they are).  Jordan-Hare has the ability and the reputation of getting unreasonably loud/bouisterous for a City that boasts a population just north of 60,000; it is quite impressive and is a yearlong, family affair (Auburn Football that is) that keeps us coming back to see what ""Miracle"" may be around the bend or how just a ""Second"" can determine State history, for good or for bad."
9579,Date of experience: January 2018,2-Feb-18,SEC,Auburm,5,SEC at it's best,"Greatest place ever to watch a football game! With the giant scoreboard, they can get the crowd rockin with old clips of Auburn football to music to fire up the crowd! Love this place!"
9580,Date of experience: January 2018,22-Jan-18,SEC,Auburm,5,Great!,This is a wonderful place to visit even if the gates aren??t open. The murals and pictures of past coaches and players are great as are the statues. You also really get a feel for the AU campus just walking around it.
9581,Date of experience: December 2017,21-Jan-18,SEC,Auburm,5,WAR EAGLE FROM THE PLAINS!,"There is no better experience than attending an Auburn home game in Jordan Hare Stadium! If you are an Auburn fan, please owe it to yourself to attend at least one home game. You won??t be sorry! It is high energy and full of positive spirit! We are season ticket holders for 30+ Years now and it just keeps getting better and better!"
9582,Date of experience: November 2017,29-Dec-17,SEC,Auburm,5,incredible game day atmosphere,Best tailgating and game day atmosphere in college football. they have made a lot of updates to the stadium in recent years
9583,Date of experience: November 2017,23-Dec-17,SEC,Auburm,4,Wow what a Stadium,"A very modern and first class stadium! It is very crowded on game day and parking of those days can be a nightmare! Be sure to arrive early for the Eagle Flight and the Auburn Band Pregame Show! The amazing SCOREBOARD Screen is on the South end of the stadium, so if you are buying tickets, think somewhere in the northern end of the stadium if possible. Concession are ok at best and the rest rooms are passable, but go early as there are long lines at halftime. The fans are what makes the stadium come alive, so go! War Eagle!!"
9584,Date of experience: November 2017,21-Dec-17,SEC,Auburm,5,SEC football,Beautiful stadium and full of energy. Best place to watch a ball game in this guys opinion. The crowd is electric as the game progresses and three fans are great to be around. All in all a great place for an outing.
9585,Date of experience: November 2017,14-Dec-17,SEC,Auburm,5,We Beat The Dogs,Great place to watch a football game.  Loads of tradition and a wonderful atmosphere to attend a ballgame.  The eage flying is a glorious sightTiger fans tend to treat visitors well.

9588,Date of experience: October 2017,13-Nov-17,SEC,Auburm,4,Nice Stadium,The view of the field is good unless you are on the very low rows. The video board is HUGE. The information shown on the video board and ribbon boards is very informative. There are plenty of restrooms conveniently located. A lot of selections of refreshments from different vendors. The pregame eagle flight is unique. The electronic music is too loud for me. I wear ear plugs.
9589,Date of experience: October 2017,9-Nov-17,SEC,Auburm,4,Nice Stadium,Fun atmosphere. Lots of nice tail-gators. The stadium was clean. obviously expect a long walk to your seats.
9590,Date of experience: October 2017,20-Oct-17,SEC,Auburm,5,Great Stadium,"This place is huge and loud when the fans are going crazy.  We watched Auburn beat Ole Miss and it was a lot of fun.  There are plenty of food places on the concourse and watching an Auburn football game is incredible.  From War Eagle to the rabid fans, it is a must see.  Everyone is dressed in orange and blue and yelling for their team as loud as they can.  WAR EAGLE!!!"
9591,Date of experience: September 2017,10-Oct-17,SEC,Auburm,5,Must go for at least one game.,Went for their home coming also was parents day.  The stadium was VERY clean and had plenty of places to get food and non alcohol drinks or they had people selling  drinks all over the stands.
9592,Date of experience: October 2017,5-Oct-17,SEC,Auburm,5,Nothing better in the state of Alabama,"There is nothing like a saturday night at Jordan-Hare.   Good years or not, we are undefeated at the parties!  Tailgating is a must and the pregame ceremony can not be missed.   WDE!"
9593,Date of experience: October 2017,2-Oct-17,SEC,Auburm,5,Best stadium ever!! Not!,I love Jordan Hare ... it is my home during football season and we go to every game.  We love being there because it is Auburn.  Love the new jumbo Tron. They have made improvements - but really does need upgrades to restrooms and a big expansion!
9594,Date of experience: October 2017,2-Oct-17,SEC,Auburm,5,Perfect southern college football experience,"There??s nothing that can prepare you for the experience of gameday at Auburn. Being from central Florida, my first game at Auburn blew me away. People coming a few days early and camping around the stadium (and all over campus). The tiger walk, the pregame show (including the incredible eagle flight), and of course the deafening roar of the crowd. Jordan Hare isn??t new by any means but it has great updates like the new giant Jumbotron, that make it feel modern. Come early and stay late to get the full experience of gameday at Jordan Hare!!"
9595,Date of experience: September 2017,26-Sep-17,SEC,Auburm,5,Love Jordan Hare,Never had a bad seat. Variety of foods offered inside and out. Nice clean restrooms. Band puts on excellent show before the game and at halftime. We love to watch the Eagle fly before the game gets started. Talk about chills.... Safe atmosphere.
9596,Date of experience: September 2017,21-Sep-17,SEC,Auburm,3,Seats in the clouds,We had fun at the football game but our seats have us noise bleeds.  We were as high as you could go but the screens did give us a good view of the game but I could get that at home.  It would be good if they had water at least at this level.  You have to go all the way down for the restroom.  It was fun to see the whole city during the game
9597,Date of experience: September 2017,21-Sep-17,SEC,Auburm,3,Jordan Hare Stadium Needs Updating,"As a donor of this program, we are disappointed in the seating selections, parking, food offered, and the lack of inside the stadium game day experience for family, and friends.  Chair seat backs are old, nasty, uncomfortable, and take up the seating area of other paying ticket holders, often times overcrowding an aisle.  On the positive side, there is plenty of area to tailgate,(if you're willing to pay a steep price to get the good spots) the transit system, while it could be run more efficiently, and logistically, it works, and saves a lot of walking if you don't get a close parking space. The stadium is being upgraded, but NOT for ticket-holders, for athlete's, and their families.  So it will be a long time before there is better seating for ticket-holders. Scholarship is basically not available for anyone for maybe 20 years, and that is just projected based on age of donors that may pass away(sad, but true).  While we are fortunate to have scholarship access, many are not, so as ticket prices climb each year people are wanting more comforts in the regular seating areas, which after so many years, they are entitled to that opinion.  Great views, no matter where you sit inside the stadium.  The band puts on a spectacular show, and the score board, well let's just say, you will never miss a play when it is on!"
9598,Date of experience: September 2017,17-Sep-17,SEC,Auburm,5,Auburn's fall family weekend,"The stadium is gorgeous, but steep.  I wish we had been able to sit with our student, but the students are in their own section.  Instead we were high, high up.  Food and drinks were reasonably priced and the Jumbotron graphics were amazing."
9599,Date of experience: September 2017,16-Sep-17,SEC,Auburm,5,Best College Football Stadium,"Of course, I am an Auburn Tiger Football Fan> Born and Raised in Auburn but we have invited many friends from in and out of the South and they all agree!  It is a great place to come to a game and the experience is awesome! The food is good too!  From the fan to the students to the band- it is first class!"
9600,Date of experience: September 2017,13-Sep-17,SEC,Auburm,4,Great Stadium,"Not Bryant Denny, but a really nice stadium.  The neatest part is when the eagle soars across the stadium before football games."
9601,Date of experience: September 2017,13-Sep-17,SEC,Auburm,5,Waaaaaarrrrrrrrr Eagle Hey!,"This place is electric on game day Saturdays!  The eagle flying, the band playing, the crowd cheering and of course the Auburn Tigers on the field!  Not much like an SEC game, it's just Southern!"
9602,Date of experience: September 2017,9-Sep-17,SEC,Auburm,5,Football Home of the Auburn Tigers,"A college Saturday football experience in the SEC.Jordan-Hare Stadium, population 86,471 max. Pre-game fly-in by our eagle,enthusiastic student section, marching band that has never lost a halftime performance, decent food, beer and wine newly offered. super place to tailgate, super Wi-Fi, 28th largest scoreboard in the WORLD!"
9603,Date of experience: September 2017,6-Sep-17,SEC,Auburm,3,Cold Food and High Prices,"Each year we hear that the food service, and other services at this location will be improved. This is code for we are raising prices and making sure you will miss at least 15-20 minutes of the game. This is a game that you may have paid over $100 per ticketto watch. Think about paying $8-10 for a dry over cooked cold hamburger. Well they do give you a slice of cheese which is cold. Ok you have your burger, so you want a Coke Zero. You looked around the entire statuim and all you see are ads for Coke Zero. Well you wait in line to find out that they do not see Coke Zero. Talk about taking advantage of people. You cannot bring anything into the statuim, so you MUST pay the price"
9604,Date of experience: October 2016,5-Sep-17,SEC,Auburm,5,Exciting!,"My son took me to my first college football game at Jordan Hare Stadium..Lots of stairs. Our seats were about 5 from the top of stadium, but the view of the game and surrounding area was outstanding! I had a great time even though I'm a Bama fan LOL Pregame parade and tailgating was a fun experience. Security is great. Restrooms were kept clean. Concessions were a little expensive but that was to be expected."
9605,Date of experience: August 2017,9-Aug-17,SEC,Auburm,5,War Eagle - Jordan Hare,This is a great football stadium for families! Parking is away from stadium but you can park at designated businesses close to Interstate (you miss all the traffic nearer the stadium) and get on a free shuttle! Lots of great football activities prior to game!
9608,Date of experience: September 2016,1-Aug-17,SEC,Auburm,4,Very nice stadium,Auburn has a wonderful stadium. The grounds are well cared for. Food vendors/workers are friendly and helpful. It's cool to watch the eagle soar. War Eagle!

Tailgating is a must. The campus is just beautiful.  The game day experience is highlighted with the eagle flying over the field and landing on the 50 yard line!  Wow!  Must add to your bucket list !
9613,Date of experience: November 2016,24-May-17,SEC,Auburm,5,Great place to see an SEC football game Auburn fan or not.,Everyone is as friendly as they come.  Courteous fans.  Clean campus and facility.  Very family friendly
9614,Date of experience: November 2016,23-May-17,SEC,Auburm,5,Orange and Blue Heaven,"There is no place I would rather be on a fall Saturday than in Jordan Hare Stadium watching my Auburn Tigers play. If you are coming for the first time, here are some things you should know. Parking can be hard to find. It's best to park and ride Tiger Transit. You will be let off less than a block from the stadium. Check the Auburn game day website for pick up places. Auburn fans are friendly. If you are cheering for the other team you will probably hear, ""Welcome to Auburn"" a hundred times as you walk to the stadium. Two hours before game time Tiger Walk takes place along Donahue Drive on the South end of the stadium. The seats are bleacher style and I recommend renting a chair back as you enter the stadium.The Eagle flies about 20 minutes before game time and is worth seeing even if you arn't an Auburn fan. Only clear bags are allowed into the stadium for security reasons and they do check them as you enter to make sure you arn't bringing in food or alcohol (or weapons). Concessions are standard. Bathrooms are plentiful and clean. It can be very hot in September, so dress accordingly. War Eagle!"
9615,Date of experience: September 2016,22-May-17,SEC,Auburm,5,Football,Best college football atmosphere and the tailgating is awesome! I feel very safe and know that the kids are safe and enjoying themselves. Don't forget to walk around downtown and visit Toomers Corner after a win!
9616,Date of experience: September 2016,10-May-17,SEC,Auburm,5,Football Game,Great stadium! Love how they have the eagle fly before the games. No alcohol and they are strict with that!
9620,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Mar-17,SEC,Auburm,5,A Winner Every Time,"No matter who actually wins the game, you're sure to be the winner here! This stadium has excellent views and if you're having trouble seeing the action, simply look towards the west side of the stadium and watch the play on the ginormous jumbotron screen! Games are full of entertainment between plays, as well. From the pre-game flyover of either Nova, the Golden Eagle, or Spirit, the Bald Eagle, to the military jet flyover, to the incredible marching band performances, there's excitement for everyone."
9621,Date of experience: December 2016,8-Mar-17,SEC,Auburm,5,Auburn Tigers,Great place for football games if your a tiger fan or not. The huge screen is amazing and can be seen almost anywhere in the stadium.

9623,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Feb-17,SEC,Auburm,5,A favorite for 30 years!,"Having attended Auburn University in the 1980's, I have seen the transformations and updates to this stadium over the years. With the new Jumbo Tron, attendees have the advantage of seeing real time plays in person and instant replays onscreen. The level of enthusiasm in the stands during games remains among the best in the country. We have the best fans around and Auburn loyalty runs deep. Auburn fans really do bleed orange and blue! This stadium has been the scene for many wins and also many losses. From watching Bo Jackson being coached by Pat Dye to seeing Cam Newton (who also won the Heisman) much later, this stadium is legendary for football greats. War Eagle!"
9624,Date of experience: October 2016,14-Feb-17,SEC,Auburm,5,Great Experience!,There is just nothing like an Auburn football game!  The magic begins before kick off with the traditional eagle's flight and then the band gets your spirit into high gear with the Auburn fight song!  Then onto the main event - FOOTBALL!  There is not a bad seat in the house with the JUMBOtron - that thing is crazy!  Fun times can be had by all fans young and old!
9625,Date of experience: November 2016,24-Jan-17,SEC,Auburm,5,Local Alum,From the outside looking in you can't understand it.... From the inside looking out you can't explain it. Some people think its just a football game but the spirit of Auburn absolutely comes alive when the Auburn Family comes together. I would recommend you come at least once and see the hospitality the auburn family offers.
9626,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Jan-17,SEC,Auburm,3,Good college venue,"We were there on a athletic visitation trip for a ballgame and the stadium was part of our visit.  The field was in beautiful shape and the Eagle flying before game was unique,  just part of a great visit to a great University"
9627,Date of experience: September 2016,8-Jan-17,SEC,Auburm,5,Auburn University Marching Honor Band,Being on campus at Auburn University always feels like home! My child was participating with the Marching Honor Band so she was on the field at half time.  Great day! War Eagle!
9628,Date of experience: November 2016,1-Jan-17,SEC,Auburm,5,A great venue for a college football game,"Easy assess to stadium with Tiger Transit from many different locations.  Easy pick up and drop off.  Getting through gates to seats is easy, once you get in the numbering a stadium entrances is confusing"
9629,Date of experience: November 2016,31-Dec-16,SEC,Auburm,5,Great football atmosphere,What a fun family friendly place to visit any time of year but especially during football season. The campus and stadium are a wonderful place to see.
9630,Date of experience: November 2016,23-Dec-16,SEC,Auburm,5,Great Gameday Experience,"If in Auburn in the fall, you must attend a football game in Jordan-Hare Stadium.  The stadium is just ok architecture wise, but the atmosphere is top notch.  Try to attend a conference game at night, that is when the crowd is most into the game.  Day games can be draining if you are in the sun all day."
9631,Date of experience: September 2016,27-Nov-16,SEC,Auburm,5,The scorboard screen is bigger than a building,We went for the Auburn LSU game and what a great time. The stadium is amazing and the scoreboard the biggest I have ever seen. Seeing the War Eagle fly down to mid-field is an amazing bonus. The tailgating before the game is at a completely different level then any other large football program I have seen. Almost every tailgate has large screen TVs to keep up with things before heading in if you have tickets. The food and set-ups are almost competitive. The people on campus and at the game were very good natured towards the opposing fans and seemed genuinely pleased to have them there for the game (must be a Southern thing). Auburn won so we got to head up to Toomers Corner and watch them roll it. They throw toilet paper so thick on the trees that you cant see a single branch. A nice young lady and her boyfriend saw my bewilderment and asked if I had ever rolled. I said no and she handed me a roll of toilet paper and said now you have. Great time.
9632,Date of experience: November 2016,23-Nov-16,SEC,Auburm,5,Fall Saturdays,"The place to be on a fall Saturday afternoon with 87,000 of my good friends watching the eagle fly and my Tigers playing football!!"

9634,Date of experience: November 2016,21-Nov-16,SEC,Auburm,5,War Eagle!!,New scoreboard is amazing and it's a great environment.  Auburn traditions make game day special.  I've been to several games and each time I've had a blast

9638,Date of experience: November 2016,9-Nov-16,SEC,Auburm,5,What an experience!,"The tailgating and game experiences are the best, and Jordan-Hare Stadium adds to the pleasure. The level of enthusiasm is well beyond anything I've ever witnessed before. Every time I've attended I've been seated in an executive suite. These are well designed and you get an amazing view of the game as it's being played. The staff are helpful and go out of their ways to accommodate the large crowds of people attending. The stadium is clean, well organized and easy to find your way around."
9639,Date of experience: November 2016,5-Nov-16,SEC,Auburm,4,A great football venue,"Auburn University continues to impress with the quality of the experience at Jordan-Hare stadium. Restrooms are plentiful which allows for shorter lines. They are --clean and well maintained. Directional signage is well positioned. The venue is up-to-date and cared for. Seats with backs can be purchased for $8.00 each just beyond the entrances and at each stadium level. Concessions are nearby for any seat in the stadium.The only concern we had was the workers (or jack of motivated workers) in the concession stand at area 41-42. Post game, there were EIGHTEEN workers yet only ONE of them (a very efficient and polite black girl) was waiting on the many customers in line. At the cash register beside her, six ""workers"" stood by and, when approached, said they are only doing refills for the souvenir cups.Sodexo needs to locate this young girl a d give her a raise and a promotion while relieving  the remainding 17 ""workers"" off the payroll going forward."
9640,Date of experience: October 2016,31-Oct-16,SEC,Auburm,4,A fine college football experience,"The tailgating and game day atmosphere rival LSU & Tiger Stadium.  The entry with the eagle is absolutely awesome -  a one of a kind experience.  Sight lines are good, as is the band.  Fans were less than welcoming - got flipped off by a really old lady for no reason at all.  But I guess that's the SEC."
9641,Date of experience: October 2016,25-Oct-16,SEC,Auburm,5,Best College Footbal Game Experience EVER!,"This atmosphere was amazing, the school/team spirit was phenomenal, I got chills from the pre-game, and the Jumbo-Tron is crazy. If you ever get a chance attend an Auburn University football game, do not pass it up, you will not be disappointed."
9642,Date of experience: October 2016,23-Oct-16,SEC,Auburm,4,Time spent with dad and son...and AU victory...priceless.,"I am in my 40's and have been coming to auburn games with my dad since I was a kid.The stadium has to be one of the best in college football. Excitement, largest jumbotron in college football, and usually one of the nation's top teams. The flying of the eagle around the stadium pure-game is something to witness. All in all an awesome game day experience. Food options have increased, including several popular chains. Seats are tight and it can be difficult to get out of your row for a trip to the facilities, but this is the case in every college stadium I've visited, and I've been to several (Tennessee's Neyland is the worst).Finding parking can be challenging sometimes, though you can usually find a $20 space in someone's yard or something. Enjoy your visit and hopefully an auburn tiger-administered beat down! WDE."
9643,Date of experience: October 2016,22-Oct-16,SEC,Auburm,5,War Eagle,Love watching football at Jordon-Hare Stadium. The Auburn Eagle is carried around the field for everyone to see him and also flies around the stadium at the beginning of the game! Amazing to see!
9644,Date of experience: October 2016,17-Oct-16,SEC,Auburm,3,Love to go and winning is even better.,We have gone for over 30 years. It has become quite a deal for security and commercial marketing over that time.  Used to get faculty discounts.

9647,Date of experience: September 2016,4-Oct-16,SEC,Auburm,5,big Auburn fan,"its great to see such a updated stadium its a lot bigger in person     than it looks on tv .most of the time I,m in Auburn I,m always working don't get to visit much"
9648,Date of experience: October 2016,2-Oct-16,SEC,Auburm,5,Love Jordan-Hare Stadium,"This is such a great college stadium.  Well organized, clean and plenty of vendors.  Love going to games here!"
9649,Date of experience: September 2016,29-Sep-16,SEC,Auburm,5,Best. Stadium. Ever!,"I'm a huge Auburn fan so of course I love watching my team play in this gorgeous stadium. There have been a few fancy additions this year. The football is brought in by drone and then dropped to be caught by Aubbie, the team's mascot. Also exciting are the fireworks set off before the game and at half time. The jumbo screen is the largest in the nation and adds to the whole game experience. Bathrooms are kept swept and clean and are conveniently located."
9650,Date of experience: September 2016,28-Sep-16,SEC,Auburm,5,Nothing else compares!,"Jordan-Hare is the ultimate football experience! Whether Auburn is winning or losing, the AU Family is united and all in for Auburn. We were there last weekend as Auburn beat LSU, and I honestly think that was the loudest game I've ever heard. The enormous screen takes the guesswork out of iffy calls by officials and the instant replay available to fans is very enjoyable. I saw several LSU fans in our section last weekend, and they were well-treated (though I would expect no less from the AU Family)."
9651,Date of experience: September 2016,28-Sep-16,SEC,Auburm,5,First visit of many (I hope),"We were here for the Auburn/LSU game last weekend. It was a great game, but we really enjoyed the venue. Security was a breeze getting in (especially since we didn't have bags). Everyone we encountered, from vendors to security to other fans, was very nice. The jumbo-tron is excellent. The vendors are set up just far enough apart so they are not all on top of each other. And I was surprised that I visited the ""facilities"" during halftime and didn't have to wait in line. It was also pretty clean in there, not what you would expect in an area with that many people."
9652,Date of experience: September 2016,26-Sep-16,SEC,Auburm,5,Auburn/LSU game,"One of my favorite and best places to see a football game.  Get there early to tailgate and make sure to get a fresh squeezed lemonade from Toomer's corner before the game.  I love the tailgating, bring some wings, low country boil, potato salad, and some desserts and you will be happy.  Stadium food is fairly reasonably priced unlike most stadiums.  After the game if Auburn wins head back to Toomer's corner for the great tradition of rolling the Oaks."
9653,Date of experience: September 2016,25-Sep-16,SEC,Auburm,5,Love This Place!,"Let me first say that we are a family of die hard Auburn fans so this might be somewhat biased.??  We love this stadium.  Outside of the gates is well maintained and beautiful.  Walking to the stadium is interesting as most of the buildings on campus are beautiful. Once inside the stadium, everything is always kept so neat.  The bathrooms are a good layout with two exits.  Every seat we have ever sat in has a good vantage point to watch games.  This is our happy place."
9654,Date of experience: September 2016,25-Sep-16,SEC,Auburm,5,Worthy Home of the Auburn Tigers,"Home to the largest video screen in college football (as of 2016), Jordan-Hare Stadium (pronouced ""Jur-don Hare"") is the place where the Auburn Tigers play.  Any big name college team will have an exciting atmosphere.  Starting from the pre-game events like the eagle flying around the stadium, the tailgating, and the ""Tiger Walk"" where the team marches to the stadium to the singing of the Alma Mater at the end, Auburn provides an intense and unique football experience.  The games usually have a few breath-taking, suspense-filled plays, so expect to leave with a few more grey hairs than you came with.  Be sure to stop by Toomer's Corner after the game with a roll of toilet paper to roll the new Toomer's Oaks after an Auburn victory!  Just follow the crowds after the game..."
9655,Date of experience: September 2016,23-Sep-16,SEC,Auburm,5,WARR EAGLE !,Always love my college football.and there is no place like Jordan Hare Stadium and Pat Dye fieldIt's Great to be an Auburn Tiger !
9656,Date of experience: September 2016,23-Sep-16,SEC,Auburm,5,MY favorite place in the fall!,Totally AUsome!I love Jordan-Hare Stadium.It's like being home!They have some new vendors for eats recently also that are very good.
9657,Date of experience: September 2016,21-Sep-16,SEC,Auburm,5,Very Welcoming To Out of Towners,"I have visited here twice when A&M has been in town to play. Each time, the Auburn fans have been very welcoming to us, even when the outcome of the games hasn't been in their favor. The campus and people remind me a lot of A&M, which has made this my favorite out of town venue to visit.The stadium is very nice and has a great atmosphere. Not quite as good as Kyle Field in my opinion, but lots of fun. The pre-game show is a must see, from the band to the flight of the eagle. The video board is nice, especially when the play action is on the opposite side of the field. The upper deck is steep and field level view is amazing. They have a nice selection of concessions and prices are about what you'd see at any college stadium.Auburn has done an excellent job with transit to/from the game and around campus. We take the shuttle from Opelika to the game and it makes everything stress free. My mom is ADA, so the golf carts that pick up from the shuttle stops and take you to the stadium were a nice touch. After the game, they do a great job of moving people quickly, even with the large crowds."
9658,Date of experience: September 2016,21-Sep-16,SEC,Auburm,4,Deceiving Capacity,"Had great seats for the game we attended, but the first few rows are basically at or below field level.  I'd get seats above say row 10.  Found myself watching the jumbo tron as much as the field - can't say if that was a distraction or helpful.  Personal preference I suppose.  If you're sensitive to noise bring ear plugs.  The design of the stadium really traps the fan noise/music.  Easy to get around and find seats, plenty of staff to answer questions.  For as many people as it holds, once inside the stadium doesn't feel ""big."""
9659,Date of experience: September 2016,20-Sep-16,SEC,Auburm,5,Wonderful college football expeience,Great facility for college football.  Excellent transit system to transport fans to and from game.  The flight of the  eagle is impressive.
9660,Date of experience: October 2015,18-Sep-16,SEC,Auburm,5,Love Auburn's football atmosphere,"We love watching an Auburn eagle flying in person inside Jordan-Hare Stadium! The new jumbo screen allows for excellent play viewing, even from the upper deck (which is very steep). Jordan-Hare is a beautiful football venue and the Auburn campus is beautiful as well. Definitely visit Toomer's Corner Drugstore and order some lemonade to complete your Auburn experience. You can now roll the new Auburn Oaks again so should Auburn win, take advantage of that tradition, as well."
9661,Date of experience: September 2016,14-Sep-16,SEC,Auburm,5,Auburn vs Arkansas St,Awesome venue! WAR DAMN EAGLE! It's had been 18 years since my last visit! Some great changes have been made! The video board is an awesome upgrade. I believe in auburn and I love it!
9662,Date of experience: October 2015,13-Sep-16,SEC,Auburm,5,Great Stadium,"We have been to several games at the stadium, and it is very nice.  I believe it holds 88k people, so it is on the large side and very loud when full.  They put in an extra huge jumbotron last year, and it is quite impressive.  If you go to a game, go early enough to watch the eagle fly around the stadium.  It's pretty special and unique."
9663,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,SEC,Auburm,5,Auburn Awesome,"Coming to watch the Auburn Tigers play at Jordan Hare was a dream come true. This was on our bucket list. The campus and stadium were great. 87000 die hard Auburn fans cheering was unbelievable. The jumbo screen was the best we've seen. Easy to see from our lower seats. Watching Nova fly around the field was so awesome. Stadium was clean including restrooms. Con- purse policy. Website did not clearly explain and I had to take small clutch back to car. If you have the chance, go to Jordan Hare and watch your Tigers. It is worth it!"
9664,Date of experience: October 2015,12-Sep-16,SEC,Auburm,5,Best College Football!,"Best College Football so far! On a given game day, this place is festive and worth visiting to experience, great game, awesome campus and family friendly tailgating.."
9665,Date of experience: September 2016,11-Sep-16,SEC,Auburm,4,Great venue - not outcome I hoped for,"My wife and I made the trip to Auburn to watch our school play. The game day atmosphere and stadium live up to its billing. I must say that we have attended games in large venues all over the U.S.  By far, the have done a great job to provide in-stadium concessions at a fair price. I would say the least expensive of anywhere I have been. Also, a great fan friendly benefit are the water refill stations around the stadium. While my team did not have the success I wanted, it was a great trip where I encountered many friendly locals. I will go back if the opportunity arises."
9666,Date of experience: September 2016,11-Sep-16,SEC,Auburm,5,The house of #WarEagle,"Excellent venue for football.  Holds a few over 87,000 of some of the most passionate college football fans.  Lots of great traditions.  I wish they served beer, but that will be a cold day in hell (Has it ever dropped below zero in Tuscaloosa?)The folks are generally friendly and welcoming."
9667,Date of experience: September 2016,6-Sep-16,SEC,Auburm,5,Great place to see a football game,We came here over the weekend to see the Clemson vs. Auburn game.  We are Clemson fans - but can say Go Tigers!!  This was a really great experience.  The Auburn fans were friendly and helpful.  The campus is clean and inviting.  The video board is incredible.  Overall a great experience and we will definitely come back here again.
9668,Date of experience: September 2016,5-Sep-16,SEC,Auburm,5,Well done AU,"These guys do a wonderful job on gameday.  I've been to many college football stadiums and this is one of the best.  The fans are generally VERY friendly and welcoming.  It's like an 80000 person family reunion.  The jumbo screen is well executed and implemented.  My only minor issue is their concessions, they need either faster stands or more of them.  I loved this place and would absolutely come to another game here."
9669,Date of experience: September 2016,4-Sep-16,SEC,Auburm,5,Auburn football,Excellent venue and competition for football & athletic events !  Stadium is clean with convenient concession stands and rest rooms.
9671,Date of experience: September 2016,4-Sep-16,SEC,Auburm,5,Auburn Clemson Game,Great staff. Love coming to Auburn games. People are nice. The stadium has also installed several phone charger stations. They are FREE. Great addition.
9672,Date of experience: October 2015,14-Aug-16,SEC,Auburm,5,Outstanding,This is the most excitting place I have ever been to see a football game.  I live in KS and the big 12 has nothing on the SEC!
9673,Date of experience: August 2016,10-Aug-16,SEC,Auburm,5,War Eagle!!!!,"As an Auburn grad, this is the place to experience a great football tradition.  The spirit is fierce and contagious."
9675,Date of experience: September 2015,26-Jul-16,SEC,Auburm,4,Time for Football,I work overseas but try to make it to as many football games as possible.  All staff are very professional and make my visit a joy each time. WAR EAGLE
9676,Date of experience: October 2015,24-Jul-16,SEC,Auburm,5,The best,"Nothing like game day at Jordan a  hare. Great time. Unlike others, f a Emily oriented experience at auburn games."
9678,Date of experience: September 2015,14-Jul-16,SEC,Auburm,4,Good stadium to see a great program play,"Jordan-Hare is a fairly large stadium, but the sight lines are good.  They now have the super sized jumbotron, so unless you are sitting in the end zone below it, you are never in want for a replay or stats.  We sat in the lower bowl on the 45 yard line on the visitors side.  Try to sit at least 20 rows up, so your view is not obstructed by the team benches.  The visitors side gets direct sunlight all day."
9680,Date of experience: October 2015,27-Jun-16,SEC,Auburm,5,WAR EAGLE!!,"There's nothing like Jordan Hare on game day! Even if you're not a true Auburn fan, it's an experience you must see for yourself. Make sure to make it in time for pregame so that you can see one of our Golden or Bald Eagles take flight. Tailgate before the game...and make sure to take a leisurely walking tour of campus, enjoying Samford lawn, Toomer's corner, the Arboretum, etc."
9681,Date of experience: December 2015,27-Jun-16,SEC,Auburm,5,Best place to be for fall football in the south!,Wonderful clean small town feeling....very friendly fans!  Great atmosphere... Not to bad on traffic getting in and out of stadium area...
9687,Date of experience: November 2015,24-May-16,SEC,Auburm,4,Auburn Football Games are exciting!,"We've been buying Auburn football season tickets forten years and loved every minute of it(except when we loose to Al.) The 2015 seasonwas an exciting one though not one of the best we've seen.With the addition of the new mammoth scoreboard with abetter display added exciting replays to every game. The food at theconcession stands is just average, but not too bad.Local churches sponsor the concession stands so we like tosupport them in spite of the long lines.We sit among many friends and family andenjoy them. Auburn fans are fortunate to have free shuttle transportation fromfrom various places around the city."
9688,Date of experience: November 2015,5-May-16,SEC,Auburm,5,My favorite stadium,"A great spot for a football game. The campus is beautiful, the fans are friendly, and the atmosphere can't be beat. The stadium has in inner concourse that you can walk around -- except for the student section. The sight lines are good and it is easy to get around in."
9692,Date of experience: September 2015,25-Apr-16,SEC,Auburm,5,Best foodball on the planet!!  WAR EAGLE!!!!,"I go to almost all the home games.  To get the full experience you have to arrive early for the Tiger Walk, watch the band play as they meet in the middle of the street coming from all four corners, & watch the eagle fly.  The excitement before the game gets your blood pumping, & ready for some Auburn Tiger Football.  Win or loose there is no feeling in the world like being in the stadium with all those Auburn fans.  Does something to you.  My granddaughter loves Aubie.  There is nothing like a football Saturday down south in the SEC!!  WAR EAGLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
9693,Date of experience: October 2015,25-Apr-16,SEC,Auburm,5,AU Homecoming,Nothing more fun than going to Jordon-Hare Stadium for any event but football games are the best. The stadium is huge. In my opinion Auburn has most awesome fans ever. Plus there nothing is more beautiful than watching the Eagle fly around the stadium before the game. War Eagle!!
9695,Date of experience: October 2015,21-Apr-16,SEC,Auburm,5,Couldn't believe its size,"I've been to two games here and have loved the experience. My seats have been in one of the suites where you can watch the game on the field or on TV. I chose a combo of both. For a stadium that holds 90,000 the process for entry and exit is smooth and easy. The staff are most helpful and friendly, and answered my questions. I hope to make it down to Auburn for another game this fall and can't wait. War Eagle!"
9696,Date of experience: October 2015,21-Apr-16,SEC,Auburm,5,Best foootball ever!!!,"The excitement before the game is electric!  Friendly rivalry, Nothing like watching the eagle fly before the game.  Everyone in Auburn is involved in one way or another on game day at Jordan-Hare!"
9698,Date of experience: November 2015,16-Mar-16,SEC,Auburm,5,My Home Away from Home,"Simply put, there is nowhere else on earth I would rather be on a Fall afternoon or night than this place.  I've gone to nearly 200 games here going back to the late 70's.  The game day atmosphere certainly picks up based on the opponent but every home game at Jordan-Hare is a special treat for the partisans and even the visitors typically walk away impressed.  From the largest jumbotron in college football to the pre-game flight of the eagle - there's plenty to enjoy, even if you're not wearing orange and blue."
9699,Date of experience: October 2015,13-Mar-16,SEC,Auburm,5,Heaven on Earth,"Beautiful and clean stadium. Wonderful, loud, friendly atmosphere. Good food choices. Rather clean restrooms compared to other stadium bathrooms I have visited. Must visit during football season. Very cool to watch the Eagle soar at the beginning of games. A little Heaven on Earth!"
9700,Date of experience: September 2015,4-Mar-16,SEC,Auburm,5,What can I say?  Football!,"Auburn football is the best - hang around outside the stadium and see the ""Tiger Walk"" , watch the fans (young and old) filing into the stadium, tail-gate tents along the campus walkways.  I find the  WIFI reception to be poor inside the stadium but other than that - it's a great experience."
9701,Date of experience: November 2015,20-Feb-16,SEC,Auburm,5,WAR EAGLE!,"Nothing like catching an Auburn game - a beautiful stadium and great traditions.  Always loud and proud no matter who the opponent is. Nestled in the heart of the Auburn University campus - it is a site to see and a lifetime event to experience a game here. Well designed with uninstructed seating views.  Get your orange out, get ready to yell and watch some of the very best college football has to offer.  Cheers & War Eagle"
9702,Date of experience: September 2015,18-Feb-16,SEC,Auburm,4,"Another SEC ""megastadium"".","Stopped by to check out the campus of Auburn University (and Toomers Corner). Relatively little open land areas around the stadium itself for tailgating, but overall a great college football venue."

The ""Miracle at Jordan-Hare,"" I was there. Two weeks later only a second was needed to beat Alabama, I was there. Cam Newton's run through LSU to the Heisman. There's nothing like it. The seats are cramped and on hot days they run out of water. But the flying of the Eagle and the pre-game ceremonies gave me goosebumps every time.  Don't ever miss a chance to see a game at Jordan-Hare, you might just witness a miracle."
9705,Date of experience: October 2015,22-Jan-16,SEC,Auburm,5,AUsome time!,Beautiful stadium. Huge new jumbotron. Food vendors inside and outside stadium. Can tour the locker room on Friday afternoons before each home game.
9706,Date of experience: October 2015,20-Jan-16,SEC,Auburm,3,"Wonderful ""War Eagle""","This is and has been one of the greatest stadiums in the Southeast, however under this Athletic Administration it has gone downhill. The Giant TV Screen is a distraction, all the advertising, other ballgames, you can't keep up with the one on the field, a big mistake. Now there is plenty of refreshments, the refreshments are kind of like the tickets, they are for the millionaires only. The trend that has been set over the last 5-10 years does not fit the GREATEST COLLEGE ON EARTH. The people sending the children to school there cannot afford the games on top of paying for education. It can be affordable for the low competition games."
9707,Date of experience: October 2015,30-Dec-15,SEC,Auburm,5,Amazing.,"Great stadium. Very secure considering it holds 97,000 people ! Good exposure to the game no matter how far you are."
9709,Date of experience: November 2015,26-Dec-15,SEC,Auburm,5,Great Stadium,"It's hard to find an SEC stadium that isn't electric any time during the Fall. Jordan Hare is no exception. If you go, you need to check out the flashing sign by the player entrance to inform when Tiger Walk takes place. It's usually around 2 hours before kickoff. This is a special tradition that's pretty cool to see. The stadium is older, but well updated. The HUGE screen is HUGE. It makes watching the game like sitting in your man cave and sitting in the stadium at the same time. It's an awesome venue and always lively. A good place to watch college football."
9710,Date of experience: December 2015,10-Dec-15,SEC,Auburm,5,IRON BOWL,War Eagle. My nephew plays on the Auburn football team. We visited to watch the Iron Bowl. Beautiful stadium. Of course would visit again.

9713,Date of experience: November 2015,1-Dec-15,SEC,Auburm,5,"Best football stadium, period","This place is what college football is all about. The atmosphere may be equaled at other SEC schools, but it is not surpassed. Been to games in other stadiums in other parts of the country, and Jordan-Hare is the best hands-down. If you get a chance to go, then just go. You'll see what I mean."
9714,Date of experience: November 2015,30-Nov-15,SEC,Auburm,5,Tradition lives here,"One of the best stadiums to watch football. Wonderful atmosphere, one of the best tailgating places in the nation. Even if you are a visitor, the Auburn nation receives you with respect and wonderful hospitality. And SEC football never lets you down!"
9715,Date of experience: November 2015,29-Nov-15,SEC,Auburm,5,Football Butt Kicking Capital of the South??  Not so much this year ...,"The new jumbotron adds a lot in terms of crowd interaction.  The students especially get into it.  Just about every game (we were here all season) there's something on there that piques the interest of just about everyone.  The jumbotron is also a nice distraction during the long spells for TV commercials.Food on the Auburn side has dramatically improved.  The same cannot be said for the visitor side.  For example, there's no Chick-fil-A, but they did push over a cart where you can get an overpriced, squished and cold sandwich made on the other side.Bathrooms are also a challenge at Jordan-Hare.  At just about anytime, there's a line.  You do not want to try the concession stands or bathrooms during halftime."
9716,Date of experience: November 2015,23-Nov-15,SEC,Auburm,5,Great Venue but the Jumbotron was a distraction,"Always a great time but I think I spent a 1/4 of the time watching the Jumbotron instead of the actual game in front of me - it was a distraction.  The SEC will come down on them on the ""Get Loud"" strobe light effect during plays - quite annoying for the offense.   BTW, stay away from the funnel cakes under section 32 - mine was close to raw and was just plain awful."
9717,Date of experience: October 2015,22-Nov-15,SEC,Auburm,5,Great SEC Stadium,"Have seen 10 SEC Stadiums, and this is a very nice and updated stadium. Good food vendors and plenty a restrooms."

Truly a terrible, expensive meal.Hot dog aside, this place is awesome."

Probably will not sit that high again."
9734,Date of experience: September 2015,13-Sep-15,SEC,Auburm,5,Huge stadium and the largest video screen,"We were here for the first home game of the season.  The stadium was sold out with 87,451 fans on hand.  They also unveiled the new $14 million video screen and scoreboard.  It is the largest screen at a college stadium.  It is a quarter acre in size."
9735,Date of experience: September 2015,13-Sep-15,SEC,Auburm,5,WAR EAGLE,Clean. Well kept. Lots of different food venders to chose from. Great place to spend a Saturday. Always enjoy walking around the campus and picking up a few new t-shirts.
9736,Date of experience: September 2015,12-Sep-15,SEC,Auburm,4,Huge Stadium! Go to Tiger Walk,"I have been to many Auburn games in this stadium. I recommend avoiding the upper deck for warmer games. You will roast! Or, if it's cold or windy, you will be miserable.  The lower decks are usually more comfortable and some seats/rows are even shaded. Always check the weather before you go! Note that the stadium does not allow umbrellas, but you can bring ponchos and rain jackets. There are several small food stands and your normal concessions. You can rent cushions with a back on them at the gate for around $8.00. Note there isn't much leg room in the stands, so if you need to stretch your legs, try and get an aisle seat. Bring cash, not all vendors accept credit, but most do. Two hours before kick off, Auburn has ""Tiger Walk"". This is basically a big pep rally. The players come in and wave to the crowd. Then, the band files in and plays all the fight songs. This is a great family friendly event. If Auburn wins, head to Toomer's Corner afterwards to help roll the oak trees. Have a good time and War Eagle!"

9740,Date of experience: September 2014,20-Aug-15,SEC,Auburm,5,"Biased opinion, but War Eagle!","I went to school here and went to most every home game while enrolled in both undergrad and grad school.  I think everyone says their stadium is the best, but I love my alma mater's.  Its got a lovely symmetry to it and nothing looks ugly about it.  Its simple which is great and they're constantly improving it in little ways.  Easy access in the center of campus is a plus as well."
9741,Date of experience: November 2014,13-Aug-15,SEC,Auburm,5,Improvements everywhere.,New jumbotron going up in south end zone that will be biggest in the USA.  The food menus have been upgraded while lowering the prices.  The variety of food has been enlarged and will suit almost any taste.  Just a great experience.
9742,Date of experience: October 2014,11-Aug-15,SEC,Auburm,5,"If you are a college football fan, you MUST see the Eagle fly!!","Nothing equals the pageantry of SEC football. We love God and country, and our families but man we are OBSESSED with our football!  We are truly a friendly stadium except for the occasional obnoxious drunk!!  Auburn folks want you to feel the warmth of the ""loveliest village on the Plains""  that is one of the hallmarks of their town. We have had many ""opposing fans"" tell us of their repeated good treatment in Auburn. Some of these fans travel to Auburn every time that we host to watch their team play, because we are friendly and because we have the BEST PREGAME in the SEC..The Eagle flying over the stadium seats..... just has to be witnessed!!  We ALL sing America the Beautiful as well as the National Anthem.  We are only rabid once the kick off takes place!!"
9743,Date of experience: September 2014,3-Aug-15,SEC,Auburm,5,"Favorite ""Site"" in Auburn!","As a lifelong Auburn fan, of course I think Jordan-Hare Stadium is awesome. However, after bringing friends from all over the country to games, I've realized just how special the gameday experience is. Having sat in the upper deck, end zone, and just about everywhere in between, I don't think there's a *bad* seat in the stadium. Bring your shaker, wear your orange and blue, and come ready to cheer on the Auburn Tigers."
9745,Date of experience: October 2014,30-Jul-15,SEC,Auburm,5,Best football experience,"Experiencing a football game at this stadium is enchanting. The stadium, fans, and atmosphere truly show what Auburn is all about which is AUmazing."
9748,Date of experience: October 2014,8-Jul-15,SEC,Auburm,2,BEWARE of low seating! Awesome Stadium - Terrible View!!,"I have been taking my two sons to various stadiums to see football games. This is a great football venue. The staff are friendly and the food is great. We booked seats that were TOO low. If you get below row 15, you can't see the field!! All you see is the backs of the players on the bench. Seriously? You put seats so low that you can't see the field? It was a great game, we watched it from the large screens. But what a waste of our money for these seats. I really could not believe they had seats this low. BE CAREFUL!!! Was not happy with the lack of disclosure, at least tell me what I am in for before I pay high $$ for a view that does not exist."
9749,Date of experience: November 2014,30-Jun-15,SEC,Auburm,5,The best football game experience!,"Of course, I've been to the football stadium!  The atmosphere is electric.  Be sure to get to your seat at least 25 minutes before the game starts because the eagle flies 17 minutes prior to the game.  Also, pay attention to the pre-game show and the AU Marching Band to get the crowd excited!"
9750,Date of experience: November 2014,30-Jun-15,SEC,Auburm,4,War Eagle!,Beautiful stadium! It could use a few upgrades though. I've gone to rival college stadium and I feel like we need to make ours better than theirs lol
9751,Date of experience: September 2014,29-Jun-15,SEC,Auburm,5,Great venue!,Always a fun time at Jordan-Hare and always some friendly folks working there as well. Great views anywhere you sit. Just to see the eagle fly is worth the trip. Head to Toomers after the game for some tasty treats.

9758,Date of experience: November 2014,3-Mar-15,SEC,Auburm,5,WAR EAGLE!!,I just love going to football games at Jordan-Hare Stadium.  The place is big enough to hold lots of people.  Easy to find your seats.  If you go to the bathroom or to the concession stand you won't get lost.  Always someone there to help you. You can ride the free tiger transit to the stadium & back to your card afterwards. Easy to find your way back to the bus.  WAR EAGLE!!!!
9759,Date of experience: November 2013,6-Oct-14,SEC,Auburm,5,Outstanding Stadium,"SEC Football at it's best. Start by driving into Auburn and seeing this monstrosity of a stadium rise up out of ""The Plains.""  Head into the game early to make sure you see the Bald Eagle circle the crowd pre-game and the roar of the crowd as they hold ""WAAAAR EAGLE"" until the Eagle lands and on every kick-off. Can't beat the tradition and love for the game in the SEC."
9760,Date of experience: September 2019,11-Mar-20,SEC,Florida,5,FOOTBALL,I have visited the stadium many times during football season Amazing experience during the games and also amazing to view with no one in the stadium. great for pictures with your UF student
9761,Date of experience: October 2019,23-Jan-20,SEC,Florida,5,A very beautiful stadium,"Ben Hill Griffin Stadium is a great stadium to watch college football games with a great atmosphere with all the Florida fans cheering for the Florida Gators. When there is no game, it's still a great place to visit or to run around."
9762,Date of experience: November 2019,8-Dec-19,SEC,Florida,5,Gator Nation Epicenter!,"The University of Florida has traditions that exemplify the American spirit. The Swamp (Ben Hill Griffin Stadium) has an atmosphere that all sports fans should experience. The way the stadium is designed creates a louder sound that reverberates and almost shakes your core. The cheers and the excitement are electric. There are several things that you will want to watch if you go to a game. Get there early so that you can witness the Mr. Two Bits cheer. You will also see the Pride of the Sunshine Marching Band perform and the Gators run out on the field. During the third quarter, there are also two more special traditions. The ??Old Boys of Florida?? song is played and the entire stadium latches arms and sways. It is visually breathtaking. Tom Petty is a Gainesville native. After his death, UF started playing his song ??Won??t Back Down?? after ??Old Boys of Florida.?? The whole stadium belts it at the top of their lungs. If it is a night game, everyone pulls out their phones and waves the light in the air. It??s magical. If you are on campus and there is not a football game playing, the stadium is open 24/7. You can go in and see the field. If you like exercising, running ??stadiums?? as Gators call it, is the greatest workout. There will likely be others running/ climbing with you. Enjoy it and Go Gators!"
9763,Date of experience: November 2019,17-Nov-19,SEC,Florida,5,Great Atmosphere,Seats on the 15 and the view and sight lines were great. The Gator band adds to the experience.  It's great that Coach Mullen has the program back and the Swamp is electric.
9764,Date of experience: October 2019,5-Nov-19,SEC,Florida,3,Auburn-Florida game,Stadium was nice. But the seats were numbered odd. Had a great time. Campus was pretty cool. The stadium is alcohol free. Just an FYI. Didn??t have enough TV screens when you leave for a drink or the bathroom.
9765,Date of experience: October 2019,4-Nov-19,SEC,Florida,2,Entusiastic Florida football fans who cheer and sing in unison - incredibly loud game!!,"We were fans from the visiting team and were happy to cheer alongside our Auburn band assembled for our ""Tiger Walk"" as Auburn's team buses came on campus. We were given a tailgate tent number so we could find our pregame gathering, but we did not see any numbers on the tents. Even though it was difficult to find our tailgate tent, we did get to see a good bit of the campus and noticed how lovely the trees and buildings were. When we entered the stadium we were very appreciative of the big water stations that had plenty of complimentary cups and cold water! It was very hot and our seats were in direct sun. The Florida fans cheer and sing with great spirit! It was the loudest football game we have ever experienced (such a great advantage for the home team). I could appreciate the experience and will have good sportsmanship, but do not think I would enjoy going back because it was unbearably loud and extremely hot."
9766,Date of experience: September 2019,9-Oct-19,SEC,Florida,5,The SWAMP!,"There is no stadium like this! The history, the alumni, the players, the band, the EVERYTHING THERE! 95,000+ people in the stadium! It's so LOUD in there! WE LOVE it!! GO GATORS!!!!!! Walking through campus on your way to the stadium is awesome. Many tailgaters having a great time. Seeing all the fans and just feeling like your around family!"
9767,Date of experience: October 2019,8-Oct-19,SEC,Florida,3,Not as bad as I expected.....,"We are trying to visit all SEC stadiums as a bucket list, this will be the last time Auburn visits Gainesville for a number of years.  I always heard how loud and rouady the fans were here.  The fans could not have been nicer, the stadium was loud but I have heard it louder. The field looks great and appeared in good shape.  The stands were nothing special, just bench seats and pretty close together, much like our home stadium.  It is not a upper deck on most of the seats which gives a better view of the field.  Concourse space was very limited and difficult to get to restrooms and concessions.  Only real problem was trying to fill a water bottle with VERY low pressure.  Overall not a bad place, just wish we had won, LOL."
9768,Date of experience: October 2019,6-Oct-19,SEC,Florida,1,A Crowded Cluster including a Combative Custodian,This was not my first visit to the Swamp but it??s is likely my last. You??ll pay $4 for a bottle of water in the 90+ degree heat. The seats are close quarters so you??ll likely get kicked in the rear by the person sitting behind you. Don??t try to go anywhere at half time because the tunnels from the stands to the restrooms/vending areas are too narrow to accommodate those coming AND going. It was also my first experience with a custodian who was yelling at the fans trying to use the restroom that they ??were coming in the wrong side?? which was not marked. She also tried to block me when I tried to enter a stall and told another fan to ??get her stank a** out of here??. Totally unacceptable and UF should be embarrassed by this behavior. I am as an alum.
9770,Date of experience: September 2019,23-Sep-19,SEC,Florida,1,Concessions ripoff,"I have been a Gator fan since 1977 despite living in Manhattan and, for the last 10 years, in Fort Lauderdale.At this Saturday's  game vs TN (Gators won!) I asked one of the roving aisle bottle sellers for a bottle of water. I had an aisle seat. I gave him a $20 bill. He looked me straight in the eye and said he did not have any change. However, he took my money and said he would return w my change. Like an idiot I believed him. He never returned to my aisle."
9778,Date of experience: September 2018,13-Apr-19,SEC,Florida,3,"Imposing stadium for visiting team, horrible seats for all in general seating","I read somewhere that for a 90,000+ seat stadium Florida has the smallest stadium, thus you are crammed in together.  I believe that??s how Florida can be so loud but you literally have no space to sit unless you have the body of a 6 year old. September and some of October is miserably hot"
9779,Date of experience: January 2019,19-Jan-19,SEC,Florida,5,Go Gators!,"Okay, full disclosure.. my daughter goes to school here, so I am obviously biased with my review. This is one of the best schools and best college football teams out there. The stadium is no exception. One of the things we love best, is that the stadium is open to the public and you can come here and walk around, walk laps, climb the stairs, and so on. Beautiful, huge stadium."
9780,Date of experience: October 2018,15-Jan-19,SEC,Florida,5,Great Game Day Vibe!,"If you are college football fan, you should try to catch a game at UF.  It's a lot of fun and the tailgating and game day activities are a blast.  Traffic getting in and out is congested, as is typical of any major sporting event."
9781,Date of experience: September 2018,25-Nov-18,SEC,Florida,5,"Welcome to the Swamp, home of the Gators!","Without a doubt, the Swamp is the best college stadium in the country.  It's loud.  It's well-maintained.  Great security and fan support.  Virtually all of the seats have a good view of the field and most have a very good to excellent view.  Just be careful what you bring with you as the security folks are rather strict."
9782,Date of experience: September 2018,25-Nov-18,SEC,Florida,5,Nice,"Great place for a workout - running the stairs, or laps. It is sometimes closed in accordance with UF events held there, so check the hours before you visit."
9783,Date of experience: November 2018,18-Nov-18,SEC,Florida,5,Great place to take in a game,"Enjoyed our first visit to enemy territory. Georgia never gets to play Florida at home and we wanted to see the Swamp in person so we attended the Idaho game. Our tickets had access to the Bull Gator Club which gave us a great meal of pot roast, biscuits, sides, and desserts. They had popcorn and hot dogs for kids too. The stadium itself had a great atmosphere; even without being completely full. I??m personally glad we play at a neutral site for our big game; the Gators have a great home field advantage with how loud it gets due to stadium design and passionate fans. Great views from our 50 yd line seats in Section 9. Loved the golf carts offered from parking locations to the stadium for a small tip...genius idea! Food choices were numerous, smelled great, and priced affordably enough. Stores in the stadium were a great way to pick up a memento of the day without having to trek to the bookstore. Worth a visit for any college football fan."
9784,Date of experience: November 2018,15-Nov-18,SEC,Florida,5,A great place to experience Gator football,"My wife is a HUGE Gator fan and this stadium is one of the best I have ever been to, the staff is friendly the pricing is very reasonable, the crowd is very entertaining, the views no matter at your seat or at the concessions you can see the game."
9785,Date of experience: November 2018,8-Nov-18,SEC,Florida,5,Gator Football,Took 2 of my sons to see the Florida Gators play. It was an awesome experience all the way around. It just so happens both of my sons have birthdays in November and as we were coming into the stadium they had a table with clip on pins for both first time people to the stadium and birthdays and they were free!! Inside the stadium it was great to see the crowd cheering and all the different traditions. Concessions were actually pretty reasonable. Had a great time even though we lost
9786,Date of experience: October 2018,14-Oct-18,SEC,Florida,5,Nothing more fun than a Gator Game!!,"I absolutely love going to this stadium for football. All seats are pretty good but try to sit on the west side so you are not looking into the sun all game. Also, it can get pretty hot so try to sit in a shady seat. Super fun!!"
9787,Date of experience: September 2018,17-Sep-18,SEC,Florida,4,Best Football Venue in the State of Florida !!,"College or Pro - the most fun venue for a football game in Florida. The fans are excited , it??s great for family??s , you can get reasonably priced seats for most game and most importantly, the kids playing are talented , put forth great effort and a very appreciative of true Gator fans !"
9788,Date of experience: September 2018,15-Sep-18,SEC,Florida,5,Nothing compares to the SEC,"We have been to Ben Hill Griffin Stadium several times to watch the Gators. Nothing compares to the sights, sounds, excitement, and experience of the swamp on college game day!!!"

Unfortunately the season start in September too late to me, but I hope to come back to attend a match."
9791,Date of experience: October 2017,7-Jul-18,SEC,Florida,5,Texas A&M vs Florida Gators,Great game and venue love the tailgating opportunities. It was kid friendly also so that is a plus. Will go there again recommend this stadium and experience.
9792,Date of experience: November 2017,1-Jul-18,SEC,Florida,5,Has to been seen in person,"Went last fall to my first ever Florida Gators game and it defiantly won't be my last.  The parking situation is a little confusing and we got stuck paying $65 dollars to park which is outrageous.  The stadium and surrounding area is so nice and we actually got to go to the SEC Nation show so we got a little tour of the campus.  The stadium is HUGE, Tv and pictures don't do it justice.  You need to see this place in person, its so cool.  The roar of almost 90,000 is a sound you can't describe.  The fans here love their gators and the team feeds off the energy.  It is bleacher seating so its a little uncomfortable, but its totally worth it.  *was november 2016"
9795,Date of experience: September 2017,5-Apr-18,SEC,Florida,3,Too close for comfort,"The Swamp has wonderful traditions,  The stadium's location in the middle of the campus gives it a feel lacking in schools where the stadiums are off campus.  But the seats are metal benches that are spaced far too close together.  Games early in the season are very hot and humid.  Drink plenty of water.  Parking is a problem and can be quite expensive."
9798,Date of experience: January 2018,17-Feb-18,SEC,Florida,4,An Amazing Open Venue,"I do a lot of traveling and love to visit university campuses. I've visited the football stadiums for the Universities of Oregon, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Texas, Texas A&M, among others, and I've never been to one I could go inside. I loved the fact that you could walk right inside the stadium and go up and down the stair while people jogged around the corridors and sat and talked. Such a marvelous idea to let the football stadium be a place for the community to use. I loved seeing the Swamp and kudos to UF for making it available to the community."
9799,Date of experience: January 2018,15-Jan-18,SEC,Florida,5,THE SWAMP,"Tim Tebow, Steve Spurrier and Danny Wuerffel , Heisman trophy winners and Spurrier most winningest coach of all time! Enter the swamp by the bull gator entrance.During a game, 91,000+ produces such energy. Nothing like it.Obviously, I ?? the Florida Gators especially Tim Tebow and Steve Spurrier.Walk around the campus.Students are friendly and beautiful campus."
9800,Date of experience: January 2018,3-Jan-18,SEC,Florida,4,Great place to explore and to workout,"We work out here 3 times a week, and have enjoyed Gator Football here from time to time. The stadium is open daily until 10 pm, with the exception of pregame days, for working out."
9801,Date of experience: November 2017,29-Nov-17,SEC,Florida,5,Nothing like a game day at The Swamp!,Love traveling down for a home football weekend!  Better when they win but a great experience nonetheless.Bit disappointed this time when finally getting through the food lines only to find hot dogs with no rolls and no pretzels without having to wait 10 minutes?!  Really?
9802,Date of experience: November 2017,26-Nov-17,SEC,Florida,1,Worst concessions ever!,"I've been to a lot of stadiums and this was by far the worst (even Rays)! Not enough cashiers, employees were slow and didn't seem to care at all, and they ran out of food just after halftime! Lines were 30-45 minutes wait at least minimum and it's as if University of Florida didn't want business during games via concessions. Game had a 12 noon start as well."
9803,Date of experience: September 2017,15-Nov-17,SEC,Florida,5,One of the larger college stadiums,The football games are entertaining. They have one of the best marching bands. You can even access the stadium for exercise or a photoshoot.
9804,Date of experience: September 2017,9-Nov-17,SEC,Florida,5,Great Place for Game Day,Always fun when the Florida Gators are playing at home. The stadium is clean and secure. Only transparent bags may be taken in (extra security started  in 2016).
9805,Date of experience: October 2017,23-Oct-17,SEC,Florida,5,Aggies visit to THE SWAMP,"Very impressed with the Gator fans, PreGame activities.and  how good the visitor seats were.

9806,Date of experience: September 2017,21-Oct-17,SEC,Florida,5,Go to the Swamp for a football game,"The energy in the Swamp is electrifying during a football game.  If you haven't been to a game I definitely recommend you go at least once! After each game, go to Turlington to view a performance by the bands Drum Line, you won't be disappointed."
9807,Date of experience: October 2017,17-Oct-17,SEC,Florida,3,Bipolar,"We have been to a lot of stadiums around the country.  The Swamp was the most bipolar experience we've had.  A lot of Gator fans went out of their way to be nice.  On the other hand, there was being flipped off with my kids while standing on a street corner, or the Gator fan next to me shouting how my team sucked, the refs sucked, everything sucked, constantly, throughout the game.  Gator fans don't kid yourselves, this is NOT the best the country has to offer."
9808,Date of experience: October 2017,16-Oct-17,SEC,Florida,5,A&M vs Florida game,We were there for the A&M vs Florida game.  The stadium is nice and the people were very friendly.  Enjoyed our time there.
9809,Date of experience: October 2017,2-Oct-17,SEC,Florida,5,Easy access when parked north,Great venue for all ages. I took my son at age 6 to a gator game. Safe neighborhood just north of stadium with lots of private paid parking for all games. Just drive the neighborhood an hour before the game and walk 5 to 6 blocks to the stadium.
9810,Date of experience: September 2017,19-Sep-17,SEC,Florida,5,Go Gators,"You couldn't find a better place to spend a Saturday than the Swamp! It is always a fun time to cheer for the Gators with 90,000 of your friends. The Swamp is loud and crazy with many Gator fans ready to cheer their team to victory. While you are here, there is a Gator shop located inside the stadium and statues commemorating Gator greats. It is quite pretty. The only downside is the expense of mediocre food. However, the hand squeezed lemonade is among the best you'll find anywhere. Go Gators!"
9811,Date of experience: August 2017,7-Sep-17,SEC,Florida,5,Super Awesome,"I hail from Texas, where football is King. So the fact that this stadium is open to come and workout, walk, view, visit, or what have you is pretty freakin spectacular in it's own right.There was so many people there running the stairs, doing laps, walking, hanging out. My gf who is a UF alum, brought me here to show me the stadium while I was in town. I was super impressed. I wasn't there for a game, although, i did pass the football team on my way in practicing at the practice field (WOW talk about security)!!!  So I can't attest to the seats or anything but the students and alumni are super proud of their school."
9812,Date of experience: August 2017,30-Aug-17,SEC,Florida,4,"""The Swamp""",They don't call it the swamp for nothing. It is all metal seating with no backs and hot as can be. Other than that you will have a great time.
9813,Date of experience: November 2016,16-Aug-17,SEC,Florida,3,Sardine can seating,"Unless you're 90 lb zero body fat grade school student, you'll struggle to fit in this stadium. OrIf you are so privileged, then a chairback section is available for a tidy sum. Then it goes up from there. Fan enthusiasm is second to none. Crowd noise is electrifying. Great event experience despite the GREED of UF to treat us commoners to a sliver of a seat. I go to a local pub to watch the game and stay away from the crowd. Oh and I can enjoy a cold beer of which is a capital offense and subject to arrest unless you're a part of the elite snob club seating. Dang hypocritical of UF."
9816,Date of experience: October 2016,10-Jul-17,SEC,Florida,5,What a place to watch a Gator football game,"If you are a football fan or just want to get a strong feeling for what it's like to go to a high level college football game, you need to put this stadium on your bucket list.  Imagine close to 90,000 football fans screaming for the Gators and you still won't believe how loud the place gets....not to mention the million dollar digital scoreboard which shows the replays instantly."
9818,Date of experience: September 2016,8-Jun-17,SEC,Florida,4,This is the Swamp,"It is a magnificent football stadium, impressive.It is not so difficult to get tickets unless it is a game against Georgia.Try to get early so you can cheer the players outside the stadium."
9821,Date of experience: November 2016,12-May-17,SEC,Florida,5,Best Place to Watch a Game,"The Swamp is a raucous and jubilant atmosphere. Come in before the game and enjoy the pre-game festivities. The marching band gets the crowd started and by the time the entrance video gets to ""The Swamp. Where Only Gators Get Out Alive"" the place is jumping with excitement. I have gone to numerous other games for teams like (LSU, Kentucky, South Carolina, Tennessee, FSU, USF, and Miami and none of them even come close to comparing to the Swamp. Don't miss an opportunity to watch a great team at a great venue!"
9825,Date of experience: November 2016,12-Feb-17,SEC,Florida,5,Good Experience,"We bought 2 tickets to the game there. The seats were good. Naturally, traffic is a nightmare. Otherwise, all went well."
9827,Date of experience: December 2016,5-Jan-17,SEC,Florida,4,first Swamp visit,I think I am beginning to understand the American fuss with football. There's an almost reverent energy in this gigantic cathedral to the iconic national sport. I look forward to returning for a game
9828,Date of experience: November 2016,30-Nov-16,SEC,Florida,3,Lots of fun!,Great time at at the UF/SC game! Go Gators! They certainly pack them in.  The seating was tight!  I think they are more concerned with getting the most people in the stadium.
9829,Date of experience: November 2016,29-Nov-16,SEC,Florida,5,Gamecocks game,Staff at gate were all very friendly and inviting. Seating was fairly easy to find. Prices were somewhat reasonable. Game was fun with lots going on during plays. Stadium was clean and safe. Go Gators!
9830,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Nov-16,SEC,Florida,5,Gator Bait!,I made my first trip to the Swamp for the UF/USC game.  This is a wonderful college football environment.  The band is skilled and this is SEC ball.  This crowd is LOUD and they know their stuff.  I sat in the Champions Club.  The seats were comfortable even for a big guy like me.  There's stuff to see all around.  The food wasn't great in Champions Club but they rolled out the ice cream carts which made things a whole lot better.  I was eating Snickers Ice Cream bars the whole second half.
9831,Date of experience: September 2016,26-Oct-16,SEC,Florida,5,Great place to go,"I have been there for several games. Always fun and especially when filled with 92,000 strong! It's clean, good food, GREAT team and always a joy to be there, especially when the Gators win"
9832,Date of experience: October 2016,18-Oct-16,SEC,Florida,5,Great Football Atmostphere,It has the perfect game environment.  Facility has been renovated and is a thoroughly enjoyable experience
9833,Date of experience: October 2016,15-Oct-16,SEC,Florida,5,The Swamp,The atmosphere is The Swamp is electric.  There are several different types of seating to choose from.  Seats range from inside seats to bench seating outside.   We sat in the Touchdown Terrace and loved it. Bathrooms are clean.  There is a good variety of food vendors to choose from. Fantastic experience ! Go Gators!
9834,Date of experience: November 2015,13-Oct-16,SEC,Florida,4,See the Gators play,"Been here a few times, always an exciting experience.  Yell with 90,000 of your closest friends.  Real community feel.  And it's a nice stadium.  It's kept up really well and always fun to go to."
9835,Date of experience: September 2016,28-Sep-16,SEC,Florida,5,Incredible atmosphere and experience!,"Going to see the Gators play at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium was amazing, truly an amazing vibe and atmosphere and such a communal sense. First ever American Football game and an unforgettable time, loved it all. The stadium is so so impressive and all well signposted and staff are very helpful. If you get a chance to go here - GO. You will not regret it."
9836,Date of experience: September 2016,9-Sep-16,SEC,Florida,5,Football fanatic fun,It's an experience. Lots of fun . We have season tickets and my husband lives for football season. Wear orange and blue .
9837,Date of experience: September 2016,4-Sep-16,SEC,Florida,4,Go Gators,"We sit in the north end zone, but high enough to see most if the action. Pleasurable experience, if it is not too hot. Seats are not fitted to the average American's posterior size. Make sure you read the rules on things you can bring in fur events."
9838,Date of experience: September 2016,4-Sep-16,SEC,Florida,5,Gator game date with my wife,This is a really great venue.  Of course I am biased a bit. The facility is actually really clean.  Large screen tvs on both end zones.  The bathrooms were decent considering the venue.  The seating is a little tight in the bleacher sections.  Good concessions with al the typical foods you would find at a sporting event.
9839,Date of experience: September 2016,4-Sep-16,SEC,Florida,4,Great experience,Yesterday was my first time visiting the swap. It was a very fun experience. The band and the way they preformed was amazing. The staff are really helpful and nice. I would definitely come again. Go gators!!!
9840,Date of experience: September 2015,26-Aug-16,SEC,Florida,5,All the seats provide great views of a football game,"It's sad to omit being a Crimson Tide fan, but the college football game I attended here provided the best view I have ever had.  My buddy and I were about 10 rows from the top around the 10 yard line but you can see everything and feel like you are right next to the field.  Kudos to the architect of Ben Hill Griffin Stadium as it is one of the best in all of college football."
9842,Date of experience: October 2015,30-Jul-16,SEC,Florida,5,The Swamp,"One of the great venues to see a college football game, especially an SEC opponent and at night when the temps are coolerl"
9847,Date of experience: October 2015,30-Jun-16,SEC,Florida,5,Go Gators!!!,Greatest place to watch college football.  During a winning season this is the place to be.!!! Bring sunscreen and cheer on the GATORS!!
9853,Date of experience: November 2015,7-Jun-16,SEC,Florida,3,"Lively, but not lovely","After visiting several SEC Football stadiums, I was very disappointed to find the lack of innovation in ""The Swamp"".  However, this did not deter the loyal fan base.  They were incredibly loud...all 90,000 of them!  I hope some facility upgrades are coming soon.  It's a lively place that needs a bit of love."
9858,Date of experience: October 2015,8-Feb-16,SEC,Florida,5,"Great Football, Great Workouts","Obviously, Florida football is amazing, and being an SEC stadium on Saturdays in the fall are a spectacle, but the beauty of this stadium, is they leave it open throughout the week for students and Gainesville residents to run the steps and workout.  Orange and Blue runs through my veins, so this is a clear landmark of childhood, college, and will be as I start my family."
9859,Date of experience: January 2016,7-Feb-16,SEC,Florida,5,See the stadium,"This is one of the few stadiums you can actually still see. I grew up in Gainesville and my kids wanted to see it. When traveling with a large vehicle such as an RV, call them first or be prepared to maneuver around to find parking."
9860,Date of experience: November 2015,6-Feb-16,SEC,Florida,5,Huge victory over Florida by GSU,Was able to experience this stadium for a third time and witnessed the victory of Georgia Southern over University of Florida
9861,Date of experience: October 2015,20-Jan-16,SEC,Florida,4,HOT Early in the Season... but WORTH IT,"OVERALL:If you want to see the Gators play live, you gotta go here. Crowded and a little crazy just before kickoff, but it's probably to be expected. GAMES:I've been going for the last four years. I had never been to a ""real"" college football game, but I started going to most games since 2012. It's probably typical of a big football school stadium: lots and lots of people (many students) and a little cramped. ARRIVING/SEATING:It can be a challenge getting to your gate if you arrive around the start of the game, so get there early if you can. People (particularly students) will often stand in the front rows... creating a domino effect so that everyone must stand. That's not a problem for me, but I feel bad for the folks behind me and want to sit, but I can't see if I do. PARKING:You may have to walk up to a few miles to get there if you don't park early enough. I ride my motorcycle and am always able to find a spot nearby. Cars, however, will take some planning.CONDITIONS:Can be super hot early in the season (and even sometimes late) so be sure to keep hydrated and bring layers of clothes. There are some water fountains, but they don't really work."
9862,Date of experience: December 2015,14-Jan-16,SEC,Florida,5,A must for Gator Fans,Just got my Season Ticket Renewal form and thought about TripAdvisor.  If you are a Gator Fan or even just a College Football Fan this is a must.  The Game Day experience is one you won't soon forget.  Come early and experience one of a kind on Campus Tailgating. Go Gators!!!
9863,Date of experience: November 2015,14-Jan-16,SEC,Florida,2,There are better places to watch a football game,"The ""Swamp"" is an okay place to watch a football game. However, there are better places to go. Many of the site lines are no that great, It is always so freaking hot that you are sweating throughout the entire game, and there is a HUGE chance that you will be surrounded by obnoxiously drunk people with little self respect or respect for other people.However, If you do happen to get lucky to not be surrounded by drunk idiots, it can be a really good experience.I choose to watch most of the Gator games on at home though.The Tailgating scene is pretty great, though! I recommend going tailgaiting and then going to watch the game somewhere else."
9864,Date of experience: November 2015,5-Jan-16,SEC,Florida,5,The swamp,How can you not love coming here.  The games are so full of energy and gator fans are loud and make it a fun atmosphere.  Go Gators!
9865,Date of experience: October 2015,31-Dec-15,SEC,Florida,5,Incredible place for game day.,"I have been going to games here for the last 40 years and I truly love this stadium. It is unique in that it is not a bowl and more fitted to the playing field. Like an old baseball stadium it has some truly unique features. With my son starting there this fall, we have had a chance to visit ""The Swamp"" on multiple occasions, the most enjoyable was for Ole Miss. That night the stadium showed what it can be like at its best.  While certainly best for game day, it is a great stadium to see any time. Go Gators."
9866,Date of experience: October 2015,29-Dec-15,SEC,Florida,5,The Swamp is a musdo on your bucket list of great college football environments,"The swamp appear the be pretty intimidating to visiting teams, and when it's a big game, there is not a more electric atmosphere to be in. Great scoreboard, fireworks, sounds system, band, the whole thing is just a fun and memorable experience.The only down side, the place can be like a Catholic Church at Easter time, very little room for your fanny in the ""designated seat: you have and lots of sitting and standing. Nobody seems to have a totally unobstructed view. But nonetheless, well, well, worth a trip."
9867,Date of experience: December 2015,28-Dec-15,SEC,Florida,5,Amazing Place,Visited the stadium in the off season. Came here with my daughter. Had to go in thru Gate 18 (?) instead of Gate 2 like it's stated online. Cannot wait to come back for football games.
9868,Date of experience: November 2015,22-Dec-15,SEC,Florida,4,The swamp is a legendary place for college football,"Being that I am a fan of that other team in Florida, I will say that I think our stadium is nicer than the swamp, but after that, I think it may be among the best in the country. The location on the UF campus is extraordinary and is a factor in the highly engaged fan base. An excellent layout, ease of access ( after the challenge of parking) is exceptional. Having been here as a visitor with the other team, there have been instances of UF fans becoming aggressive simply because my jersey isn't blue and orange. So, the stadium is amazing, the fan base loud and behind their team ,but watch out for the trouble makers"
9869,Date of experience: November 2015,29-Nov-15,SEC,Florida,5,Can't help but get caught up in the action,This was my first college game and it couldn't have been better. Game went to overtime with and exciting finish. This is a much different experience from a Pro game and in many ways I like it better. Bring binoculars as this is a huge stadium and very loud. Can't wait to go back.
9870,Date of experience: November 2015,26-Nov-15,SEC,Florida,5,Welcome to the Swamp!,The SEC East Champion Florida Gators play in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. What many people do not realize is that the stadium is free and open to the public when there is no football game.
9871,Date of experience: August 2015,14-Nov-15,SEC,Florida,5,Go Orange and Blue!!!,"We have attended several games at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium during the football season; however, our most cherished moments are in the summer when our grandchildren visit. They love going there and roaming through the 90,000 plus seat stadium. They dress in their Gator gear and have a ball. Why pay for DisneyWorld (which we have) when they can go to the Stadium for free and use their imagination."
9872,Date of experience: November 2015,9-Nov-15,SEC,Florida,5,Rock the swamp!,"If you are a college football fan much less a Gators fan and haven't experienced this stadium, then you are missing out! The stadium is truly amazing inside and out. NOTE: THE WEST side seating in the stadium is best if you want some afternoon shade. The food was surprisingly good as we had the pulled pork nachos and a pulled pork sandwich. Nearby, there are Steve Spurrier, Danny Weurful, and Tim Tebow statues to see. As far as the venue, a game in The Swamp is very close to being unmatched in college football."
9873,Date of experience: November 2015,7-Nov-15,SEC,Florida,5,Gator football SEC east champs,Great stadium and loyal fans. Worth catching a game if you are in for a game weekend. Pick a seat in the shade way too hot in sun for day games
9874,Date of experience: September 2015,26-Oct-15,SEC,Florida,5,Cool place that takes your breath away,"They are usually open to the public all the time. Go in by finding an open gate near the front. I've brought guests to see it many times, and I've always found a gate open. Some people even go out on the actual field. People do stairs there a lot too. They call them ""stadiums""."
9875,Date of experience: September 2015,26-Oct-15,SEC,Florida,5,Many years,"Well I am a Gator graduate and have been going to game since 1963.  I have watched it grow over the years and have seen many famous and fantastic games in the Swamp including when Steve Spurrier, Danny Werfel and Time Tebow were quaterbacks"
9876,Date of experience: September 2015,21-Oct-15,SEC,Florida,5,THE SWAMP,"if you are a Gators fan and haven't experienced this you are missing out! The stadium is truly amazing inside and out. First make your way to see Steve Spurrier, Danny Werful, and Tim Tebow statues. Across the street is the O'Connell Center where the Gators dominate in Bball. Before the game start attend the Gator Walk on the north side of stadium. Once through the gates you can pay a 15 dollar (cash only) fee and rent a comfortable seat back stadium chair for your seat. Highly recommended. The food was quite surprising, ordered nachos and it was enormous. Definitely large enough for two people. As far as the venue, a game in The Swamp is very close to being unmatched in the college football world. Check it out."
9877,Date of experience: September 2015,16-Oct-15,SEC,Florida,5,Awesome!,We visited the stadium on a weekday while there were no crowds for a game.  The stadium is impressive and beautiful in its own special way.
9878,Date of experience: October 2015,15-Oct-15,SEC,Florida,1,What a dump,"As a Tennessee fan, I naturally hate your stadium and my visit only confirmed that.  Access to the stadium is pretty good, if you like meandering through 90k pairs of jorts. Concessions and the concourses need to be updated.  Surely with all the money you are saving from not having to build any Tebow statues, I figure its a pretty solvent time to do so.  As far as your fans, rude. 50+ year old women called me a term for ED with no provocation, a rather slender young and told me to go back to Tennessee. Which if you've ever been to Gainesville you understand that I would gladly go back to Tennessee to escape G-town. You also need to stock more water, I mean seriously, its Florida, it gets hot, stock the Water, how does one sell out of water.....  Your seating is terrible had the end of a row in the visitors section, which one would assume is the largest seat on an aisle.  Its 5 inches on a good day. So bump that up a tick, maybe 12 inches, heck even 18 would be nice.  Bathrooms were large enough, points to you there. Video Boards were alright but littered with Florida plays, I mean seriously how about some away team love. The Orange painted all over the stadium is the wrong color, its more of a creamsicle. Alas, my experience was less than good and it had nothing to do with the come from behind loss my beloved Vols had, only to do with your terrible stadium.  I mean why would you pick Gainesville for a University, all of Florida and you said nah I don't like beaches but I do love sweat and sand. Don't visit here, its where dreams come to die."
9879,Date of experience: October 2015,8-Oct-15,SEC,Florida,5,Can see the game so well even from the cheap seats!,Visited for the FL/Ole Miss game. Loved the stadium and all that they offered. Enjoyed myself so much at the game. Was shocked at how well I could see the entire game from my seat way up high. The only negative was the 30 minute walk from where we had to park but that is to be expected in a college town.
9880,Date of experience: September 2015,8-Oct-15,SEC,Florida,5,Great Stadium,"Visited from Tennessee for football game. Seats were pretty high up, but view of game was still great. Easy to navigate. Plenty of concession areas and restrooms. Bottled water $4, Gatorades $6. Good SEC experience. As fans for the opposing team, we were treated pretty well."
9881,Date of experience: October 2015,4-Oct-15,SEC,Florida,4,Beautiful well maintained stadium,"This is a large beautiful stadium. Food prices are reasonable and there is plenty of staff to make entry and amenities easy to get. The over exuberant fans can make it less than a great experience. One fan fell into our group and we were hit on the head at least three times. A drunken ""Sorrrry!"" doesn't cut it."
9882,Date of experience: November 2014,4-Oct-15,SEC,Florida,5,The Swamp is Florida Football,If you love Gator Football there is no other place like it. Nicknamed the Swamp and early on in the season it lives up to the name.
9883,Date of experience: October 2015,4-Oct-15,SEC,Florida,5,My first SEC experience,Had a great time here for the Ole Miss/UF game. I was a neutral fan so I got to really take in the whole environment. UF fans are extremely passionate and are on their feet all game. What really stood out to me was how loud it was on 1st and 2nd down. Bathrooms and food were plentiful and easily accessible. If you are a college football fan put this on your list for places to see a game.
9884,Date of experience: October 2015,4-Oct-15,SEC,Florida,5,Gator nation,Went for the Florida vs ole Miss game and it was AWESOME as it always is. It's great to be a gator! Even if you're not a fan go and see this stadium its amazing and beautiful
9885,Date of experience: September 2015,3-Oct-15,SEC,Florida,5,TRUE GATOR FAMILY,We love the Gators and had to see the SWAMP WE LOVED EVERY MINUTE AND EVERYONE WAS SUPER NICE. We took plenty of pictures as you can see Go Gators
9886,Date of experience: September 2015,1-Oct-15,SEC,Florida,5,Every Seat is a Good Seat,"I've been to the Swamp a number of times to see Gator football and usually have great seats. For the first time last week, I had ""nose bleed"" seats. The seats were still great! The design of the stadium is such that there is no bad seat in the place. I was very impressed!"
9887,Date of experience: September 2015,28-Sep-15,SEC,Florida,4,ECU invades ben hill griffin stadium for some SEC officiating calls that don't go our way.,Older stadium but really big. Turf did not hold up well under the rain conditions. As much rain as they get here seems they would have better grass or a better draining field.
9888,Date of experience: September 2015,28-Sep-15,SEC,Florida,5,Best Stadium in the State!,This has to be THE best stadium in the state.  It can get loud....really loud and the emotion for the Home Team is the best.   No better fans out there.BTW...GO GATORS!
9889,Date of experience: September 2015,28-Sep-15,SEC,Florida,4,Pleasantly Surprised,"Visited this stadium for the TN/FL game in 2015. Typically Gator fans are known for not being the greatest hosts, I will say that this trip they broke that stereotype. Fans were nice!! Love that the university/stadium offered things to help fans stay cool. The ""cool down"" buses , misters, and even hand fans were awesome!!! Thanks UF for the hospitality!!"
9890,Date of experience: September 2015,17-Sep-15,SEC,Florida,5,You must go at least once!,"I've lived here all my life, and this stadium is a must visit. Even in the off season, very impressive sports arena. Now during a Gator game, OH MY GOODNESS! If you've never experienced the sound of in excess of 90,000 people, you must try it at least once!"
9891,Date of experience: September 2015,16-Sep-15,SEC,Florida,5,Florida vs East Carolina,Great Game!! Great Football shared with everyone! First time to sit in opposition shared seats. Truly enjoyed the FRIENDSHIPS made with the parents and friends of both teams!  Wish both a great season!
9892,Date of experience: September 2015,14-Sep-15,SEC,Florida,5,Florida Vs East Carolina,"Took in a game at Ben Hill Stadium.  Little rainy at times, but a cool temp was nice.  Good facility for a game."
9893,Date of experience: September 2015,8-Sep-15,SEC,Florida,5,Great Fun,"We're from Wash DC, and attended the UF vs NMSU game.  Our Family of four had a blast.  The entire stadium attendance of 90,277 acted in unison.  We were screaming almost the whole time there, or at least it seemed like it, being hoarse now. You need to go to a game, wear Orange and Blue, and have fun. We were in Section 1 and had a great view.  Also, after every touchdown, they shoot the fireworks from the south end of the stadium. Highly Recommended."
9894,Date of experience: November 2014,1-Sep-15,SEC,Florida,5,The Swamp: Nothing compares!,The most awesome college football experience you will ever find! Absolutely nothing like an afternoon or evening in the swamp watching the Gators do their thing. Love this place!
9895,Date of experience: November 2014,27-Aug-15,SEC,Florida,5,swamp offers positive energy,the size of it  offers great views to all who enter.. and once inside its like nothing you have ever experienced incredible energy from the terrific gator fans.. the sound travels right thru you there are actually many offices and other cool things i would suggest a tour I remember going on a field trip there when i was young and couldnt get over all the space inside.. there even was a tv station .. season starts sept 5 and if you get a chance gator fan or not the whole positive energy and crazy fans will be worth the trip..  its a focal point in town and holds dear memories for a lot of gainesville .. gator growl or working your way thru the season selling gator cups with coke.. parking can be a bear but many people offer parking in there lawns or the town offers park and ride shuttle from the mall.. but once inside on a game day you will never forget the swamp.
9899,Date of experience: August 2015,12-Aug-15,SEC,Florida,5,Second best stadium in the country.,This is the second best stadium in the country. I am first and foremost a die hard Penn State fan so my favorite place on a Saturday is Beaver Stadium. But I marridd into a Florida Gator household and my husband and kids are die hard Gator fans. Have spent many a Saturday here in Gainesville watching the Gators play football. Have had a seat in almost every place in the stadium....fond memories of Tim Tebows last game as a Gator against Florida State...gotta go at least once.oh and the football museum don't waste your time busting your butt on a weekday to see it.....not even a museum just a place for trophies.
9900,Date of experience: August 2015,9-Aug-15,SEC,Florida,5,Great  field,We took a walk around the area and inside the football field.  It s a beautiful field the area is packed with statues and placks of famous UF football players. Great place to visit or to get a great education.
9904,Date of experience: November 2014,20-Jul-15,SEC,Florida,5,"Loud, fun venue",No better place to catch a college football game!  I've been to almost every NFL stadium and many college stadiums and nothing compares to the atmosphere and traditions.
9908,Date of experience: October 2014,8-Jul-15,SEC,Florida,1,The Worst of Everything at the Highest Prices,"Like all sports venues, the staff at these places should wear a hoodie and mask.  No gun is needed as the rob you at every turn with ridiculous prices on the food, drinks, and college gear. They took lessons from airports and then upped the price of everything in sight.  Many of the people who work there are ashamed to look you in the eye as they pick your pocket clean. Come prepared.  Eat and drink before you arrive and shop at the big box stores.  These basic rules might leave you with enough spirit to enjoy the game without cussing the administration."
9910,Date of experience: August 2014,1-Jul-15,SEC,Florida,5,Stadium runners,Home of the gators.  It is opened daily and you can see many people of all ages there running stadium steps.
9911,Date of experience: September 2014,30-Jun-15,SEC,Florida,5,Gator Football,The Swamp is an awesome place to visit and cheer on the Gators!The atmosphere during a game is contagious and a must! A beautiful place to visit with friends and family.
9916,Date of experience: November 2014,5-Jun-15,SEC,Florida,2,needs a serious remodel,"The swamp used to be really nice, back in the 1999s.  But today it is just old looking and run down.  It needs remodeling badly!  It just can't compete with any updated facilities!"
9920,Date of experience: September 2014,19-May-15,SEC,Florida,5,Does anyone really need a positive review of THE SWAMP?,The FL GATORS play football here! Enough said. If you can get into the Champions Club or better seating do it. It's a completely different experience and well worth it.
9924,Date of experience: October 2014,29-Mar-15,SEC,Florida,5,Go Gators!,"Love, love, love my Gators and where better to see them than in the Swamp.  Advise you to pick a date late in the season and a night or late afternoon game as it can get really hot if you are not in the shady seats.  Great food, fun and of course the band, majorettes, dance team and cheerleaders supply plenty of entertainment.  Come on down to Gator Town!"
9925,Date of experience: August 2014,17-Mar-15,SEC,Florida,3,Hot as Hades,"The Stadium is wonderful to explore - just not on game day!  Too many people, and all that heat, made for a very miserable day.  On a good note, the Gators did win!"
9927,Date of experience: September 2014,12-Mar-15,SEC,Florida,4,Unbeleivable College Atmosphere!,"I went to a Gators Game for the first time and can clearly say that I absolutely love college football way more then NFL now. The atmosphere that day was electric and simply unique to the college sports. The fans were chanting the whole time and I tried participating as much as I could. Even though there is no alcohol in the stadium, we still did plenty of drinking before the game tailgating with fraternities from Florida. Definitely an awesome place to watch a football game...Go Gators!!!"
9929,Date of experience: November 2014,18-Feb-15,SEC,Florida,5,Swamp time,As far as stadiums go each one has its own flavor. Locals stop by to exercise in the open stadium during the week and game times are always exciting.
9930,Date of experience: September 2014,3-Feb-15,SEC,Florida,4,The Swamp!,"This is the University of Florida!  Whether a football fan or not, you must visit this place.  It seats 92,000 people, and is a huge venue.  There is a bull gator statue for photo ops, many other places for picture to be taken. While there, check out all the oh her great sights on campus"
9931,Date of experience: January 2015,27-Jan-15,SEC,Florida,5,Beautiful Place!!,Huge and so nice to see!! Gator Nation is happy to make sure you have a great time!! Always in great shape and lots to see! Come by and visit...well worth it!!
9932,Date of experience: September 2014,22-Jan-15,SEC,Florida,4,Go Gators!,Great stadium but pretty hot for day games. Keep hydrated and have snacks.  This is a good way to enjoy a college game.
9933,Date of experience: January 2015,19-Jan-15,SEC,Florida,5,Experience like no other,"You haven't experienced football until you've been to a game here. The atmosphere is incredible, completely unimaginable. You can read about it all you wan, but until you actually experience it you can never understand it. So loud, so thrilling, so SEC. Go Gators!!"
9934,Date of experience: December 2014,8-Jan-15,SEC,Florida,5,What a feeling,From the very first time you step into a packed stadium you will forever and always feel the rumble in your soul.

9936,Date of experience: January 2015,6-Jan-15,SEC,Florida,5,Stadium is open most times,"I have attended many games here but generally don't get to go to many Gator games anymore since I live over 500 miles away.  However I always stop by the Swamp in visits to Gainesville.  It is almost always open and worth a view even if you aren't attending a game.  You may have to search around for a gate to get in but it is pretty much open every day. This is truly a mecca for Gator fans.  It is a good place for visitors to see what a large college football stadium looks like as it seats close to 90,000 fans.  The beauty of coming on a non-game day is that you can sit anywhere you want and get different views of the field. While here note the notable attractions outside of the stadium like the large bull alligator and the three statutes of the Gators three Heisman trophy winners, Tim Tebow, Danny Wuerffel and Steve Spurrier.  There also is a Gator gift shop right outside of the stadium.."
9937,Date of experience: December 2014,6-Jan-15,SEC,Florida,5,Go for a RUN!,"Stadiums, Stadiums, Stadiums. Great place to run and exercise. So many locals use the facility and it is great that UF lets us! GO GATORS!"
9938,Date of experience: November 2014,5-Jan-15,SEC,Florida,5,Go Gators!,Great stadium!  Enjoyed a football game in the swamp!  Great energy among Gator fans. Game days are super exciting but the stadium is always open to look around and take pictures.  So happy to be the parent of a Gator!
9940,Date of experience: November 2014,9-Dec-14,SEC,Florida,5,The swamp is great!,"Very nice stadium. Easy to get in and out. Take a shuttle if you can, because parking is a premium. There is also a nice gift shop for Gator fans very close by. The campus is beautiful..a great place to take a stroll on a Sundaya when all is quiet!!"
9941,Date of experience: November 2014,5-Dec-14,SEC,Florida,5,Gotta go!,"At least once you have to experience the""swamp"".  The excitement, spirit and enthusiasm of the crowd will blow you away.  Once the chomping starts, it's ""Go Gators' all the way!  Glad to be a proud parent of a Gator (twice now and, hopefully, a third next year :)"

Needs better parking options, food options and more than a gator walk and gator nation that now is copied everywhere.  Welcome Coach Mc, goodbye Champ and lets find, start a new winning tradition !  Gators 4 Life !"
9943,Date of experience: October 2014,3-Dec-14,SEC,Florida,5,Great Experience!,"Even if you are not a college football fan, you will have a great time visiting the 'Swamp'. The atmosphere and excitement are overwhelming. You can't help but get involved once the cheering starts."
9944,Date of experience: September 2014,2-Dec-14,SEC,Florida,5,The home of the Florida Gators!!!!!!!!!!!,"What's more to say?!  This is the most energy-packed, team-spirited stadium in the south!  THE SWAMP!  Where only Gators get out alive!"
9945,Date of experience: November 2014,24-Nov-14,SEC,Florida,5,Go to a football game!,"Do your self a favor and go to a football game.  I have only been able to go to one game, and it was a game that the gators loss.  Even though we loss I had a great time.  Throughout the entire game you can feel the emotions of the spectators, it was fascinating."
9946,Date of experience: November 2014,20-Nov-14,SEC,Florida,4,Game days are awesome,"You really can't beat the game day experience at UF. One of the biggest and most active stadiums in the country, You'd be hard pressed to find a better home field advantage than at Ben Hill. Bring a lot of money or eat before hand, because nothing is cheap here."
9947,Date of experience: November 2014,16-Nov-14,SEC,Florida,4,Visit to the Swamp,"Had a great visit to the Swamp! It helped the Gamecocks pulled out a crazy miraculous win but even if had loss was a great experience. If your favorite football team ever plays in Gainsville I highly suggest you check it out and go. Hospitable area, people, and the stadium is pretty awesome with all of the blue and orange and fandom. *Tips Hat* to the Gators"
9949,Date of experience: October 2014,2-Nov-14,SEC,Florida,5,Football Heaven,"This is not the ""year of the gators"" so getting a ticket should not be a problem. Watching the University of Florida football is what my husband ""lives for"" all year long. Great venue."
9951,Date of experience: October 2014,21-Oct-14,SEC,Florida,4,UF Homecoming,"Stadium was great, scoreboards easy to see, pre-game entertainment good.  Game: terrible!  So bad we left at halftime..."
9952,Date of experience: October 2014,19-Oct-14,SEC,Florida,4,Go Mizzou,Easy to get into to stadium.  Everyone at the stadium was great and the atmosphere is awesome.  Our seats were in the end zone but we could still see everything.  I don't think there is a bad seat in the house.
9953,Date of experience: October 2014,17-Oct-14,SEC,Florida,4,CHOMP CHOMP!,"This was my first time experiencing a game at THE SWAMP!  As a football lover, the experience is first class!  The fans are very supportive of their team and EVERYONE is in blue and orange.I'm only rating them 4 out of 5 stars, as we had a couple of small issues once inside - (1) there's no smoking at all and no one explained this to my fiance, who enjoys a cigarette at halftime.  (2) the concessions are not helpful at all if you have any allergies; recommended that we didn't eat anything. (3) the website where we bought our tickets suggested that we buy the seatbacks and when we arrived, our seats were SEATS and did not require the seatbacks.  $40 wasted."
9954,Date of experience: October 2014,16-Oct-14,SEC,Florida,3,I am too old for this!,"When in Rome.... we have been to FSU games so we figured we would check out a Gator game.  Once inside the stadium it was very crowded and there were many drunk people, included one being escorted in handcuffs by 2 cops.We were starving and got 2 personal pizzas (Dominos) a drink and a bottle of water($25.50). The pizza was gross, not just stadium gross, but gag when you open the pizza box.We got to our seats and prepared ourselves for the drunks.  Within minutes of sitting down, both my fiance and I had Jim Beam spilled down our backs (It was a lovely scent to have during the game).  A few minutes later we got even luckier, the people in the two seats next to us got there.  This guy was drunk and immediately sat mostly in my seat, I didn't even have a half a butt cheek on my seat.  Everytime he would stand up I would scoot over a bit, so when he sat down, he would half sit on my lap.  No apologies, just sit on me, elbow me, it was lots of fun!  Even better was he was yelling and screaming the entire time, and coaching the team from his seat.  Maybe I am just not cut out for this college football thing?"
9955,Date of experience: October 2014,15-Oct-14,SEC,Florida,5,Go Gators!!!,I am a long time alumni and actually never been to the game before all 7 years I've spent at UF.  The stadium is constantly renovated and extended.  I remember it in 1993 when I was a freshman and today it's a totally different beast.  Getting in and out of it as well as the campus itself during the game is a little painful.Every gator fan should experience it at least once and it is always friendly toward the opposing team.
9956,Date of experience: October 2014,14-Oct-14,SEC,Florida,5,LSU v Florida,"I'm an LSU fan so I try to see them if they're anywhere close to me and this was one of the better away games I've been too. Crowd was really into it, very loud, great environment for a college football game. Stadium was nice and seats are the standard bench you get at every other game. Food and drinks were pretty standard but not overly expensive in any way. The best part was the electricity in the stadium... The crowd was a big factor. SEC football at its best when even two teams who are having an off year can still evoke that reaction from their fan bases. Also LSU won... So that was icing on the cake!"
9959,Date of experience: September 2014,16-Sep-14,SEC,Florida,4,Great venue...it's the Swamp!,"The Swamp is a classic football stadium. Not a bad seat in the house. But, it's hot even during a night game."
9960,Date of experience: September 2014,16-Sep-14,SEC,Florida,4,rowdy night at the Swamp,"This stadium is a typical college stadium.  Bring cash for the vendors, as many don't take credit/debit cards.  There's lots of food offerings if you roam the different levels and parts of the stadium.  Be prepared for lots of orange and blue, and its hot."
9961,Date of experience: September 2014,2-Sep-14,SEC,Florida,5,The SWAMP! BEST place to be on a Saturday!,"If you LOVE football - this is THE place to be on a ""football Saturday"". ENERGY, EXCITEMENT, and lots of FUN! Wear your orange and blue colors and bring your LOUD cheering voices!"
9962,Date of experience: August 2014,2-Sep-14,SEC,Florida,5,Awesome,My first football game and the stadium was amazing. I recommend it for Gators fan. I really enjoy the crowd and the University
9964,Date of experience: November 2013,28-Aug-14,SEC,Florida,3,Try to wrangle invitation to Presidents Box,Huge stadium with lots of seats in the direct sun.  Be sure to check your seat location before you purchase the tickets.  Be prepared to go through security.
9968,Date of experience: September 2013,22-Jun-14,SEC,Florida,4,Awesome and Energetic Stadium,"The stadium is shaped like a large bowl...which is what makes it so energetic and intimidating to visiting teams on game day. Unfortunately, this design also makes it a huge heat trap and the temperature inside, especially during summer and fall, is ridiculously hot.When weather permits, I enjoy running stadiums here and have climbed to the top and sat down to read. The fact that it is almost always open to the public is probably my favorite part about it."
9970,Date of experience: October 2013,28-May-14,SEC,Florida,5,What's not to love?,"If you love watching live football, you'll absolutely love the energy at this stadium. It's one of the largest, and loudest, in college sports. Yes, it gets hot. Yes, it's crowded with enthusiastic fans. Yes, you're going to have to wait in long lines for food and the bathroom. But trust me, it's worth it. You'll never forget your time theres, especially if the Gators win. :)"
9971,Date of experience: October 2013,22-May-14,SEC,Florida,3,Rediculously hot,I have been to many college stadiums but Ben Hill is by far the most uncomfortable I have ever been in a stadium. If you go to a game try to go to a night game. Very little shade.
9972,Date of experience: October 2013,19-May-14,SEC,Florida,5,Gator Bait..,"Ben Hill Griffin Stadium aka The Swamp is the home of the Florida Gators football team.This place gets to rocking on Saturdays,great tailgating can be found before the games.The fans are generally fun and friendly unless of course your a Georgia Bulldog or Florida State Seminoles fan.I have been to the swamp several times and from the seats to the atmosphere,the Swamp is a great place."
9973,Date of experience: September 2013,20-Apr-14,SEC,Florida,5,The Swamp!,"A great stadium to watch a college football game in the falls when the Gators take the field for their home schedule.  Two huge replay boards to see replays and stats with a great sound system (AC/DC Thunderstruck before the kickoff!).90,000+ people take your breath away the first time you take in a game there.  Nothing like the fans in the stands swaying to ""We Are The Boys of Florida"" at the end of the 3rd quarter and the Gators taking the field to ""Here Comes the Gators"".  The stands are so close to benches that the opposing team can hear the students calling out to them :-).My first game there was in 1981 as a college freshman and have been a season ticket holder since graduation."
9976,Date of experience: November 2013,17-Apr-14,SEC,Florida,5,The best college football stadium,"Wow, noisy, spirited, a sea of orange and blue everywhere. They don't call it ""The Swamp"" for nothing, a tough place to play for visiting teams.  If you have on your bucket list going to a college football game, this is the place to come, the SEC has fanatic fans and the top teams in the country.  Food here is a bit lacking though compared to other stadiums I think."
9977,Date of experience: November 2013,15-Apr-14,SEC,Florida,5,Gator,"The stadium rocks with excitement: With 90,000 + fighting gator fans in their seats. While no longer a ""Season Ticket Holder"", I generally attend 1-2 games."
9978,Date of experience: January 2014,15-Apr-14,SEC,Florida,5,Florida Field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium Home of the Gators,"No other place like it in America for watching college football. order tickets well in advance. The roar of the crowd, the band, student section doing the wave. It's all there."
9981,Date of experience: November 2013,15-Mar-14,SEC,Florida,5,Gator home,"Gator football -- what more can you say?  We had great seats here and it is quite nostalgic of good ole college days just to drive by it.  The facilities -- rest rooms, food service, club areas are all top notch."
9983,Date of experience: October 2013,4-Jan-14,SEC,Florida,5,Amazing atmosphere,"I was here to root for the visiting team....and loved the atmosphere both inside and outside the stadium. If you want a true college football experience, go here. Oh..you'll notice that the field in lower than the street level."
9984,Date of experience: November 2013,10-Dec-13,SEC,Florida,5,Georgia Southern,"We sat in the student section, with block seating. Location was great except it was 34 years since my last game and I forgot how ""roasted"" you got from the sun. I would have done anything to trade with outfits with a sorority girl wearing a sundress."
9985,Date of experience: November 2013,26-Nov-13,SEC,Florida,5,"Had a great time, even though we lost...","First time at a Gators game and I truly enjoyed the experience. The fans were positive and interactive without being rowdy and obnoxious. Lots of families, which was nice.  Parking was easy for us since we had a pass but stadium was easy to navigate and everyone was friendly.  We will be back, Go Gators!"
9986,Date of experience: August 2013,25-Nov-13,SEC,Florida,5,Fun to visit when it's empty,Went with a friend--she ran stadiums and I went to the top row of seats and watched the sun set over the stadium. It's quite impressive when empty!
9987,Date of experience: November 2013,25-Nov-13,SEC,Florida,5,Great workouts. Awesome Views.,"So great that the stadium is always open. It's a popular workout place for students and locals. People walk or run the bleachers and stairs. Pushups and dips and all sorts of things. It's fun just to go look at the view you get from way above. And such a cool place for photo-ops. If you're in town, swing by for the views or a fun workout."
9989,Date of experience: November 2013,17-Nov-13,SEC,Florida,4,What A Cool Facility,"It is easy to see why the Swamp is one of the tougher NCAA stadiums to play in.  While we did not attend a game here yet, we walked through the stadium on a Sunday afternoon and it is even more dominating in person then on TV.  I can only imagine the amount of pressure on the opposing team when the stadium is packed.  The entire design of the stadium is geared to fan intimidation and getting that home field advantage."
9990,Date of experience: October 2013,6-Nov-13,SEC,Florida,5,Very good experience,"This was my second time at a stadium. It was great. A perfect organization, security checks everywhere, that made me feel very safe, with all those people. Somebody told me that during daytime it's very hot, but I was lucky enough to go at 7 pm. I loved the band exhibition, they were fantastic! And the cheerleaders, too. I don't understand anything about football, but I enjoyed the game a lot.The lemonade was very good, too."
9991,Date of experience: October 2013,24-Oct-13,SEC,Florida,5,a treat for the eyes and Kids!,"our daughter had never been to a large stadium so this was major. She climbed all the way to top and ran up and down field, just for kicks!"
9992,Date of experience: October 2013,21-Oct-13,SEC,Florida,5,ONLY GATORS GET OUT ALIVE,"FOR A GAME, it's hotter than hades. You have to buy expensive lemonades just to survive. this week we visited it while it was empty, and it's awesome either way. Been coming here for games since 1965, before it was the Swamp, before it was Ben Hill Griffin. Don't miss it! Go Gators!!!"

9994,Date of experience: October 2013,10-Oct-13,SEC,Florida,5,Love this place,We were in the sky box. I love this place. GO GATORS! We were also in the F club. The staff is very friendly and helpful especially Bill in the F club. I'm ready for the next home game.
9995,Date of experience: August 2013,3-Oct-13,SEC,Florida,5,"""The Swamp""","Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, Florida Field or the Swamp, this magic place goes by all these and is part of the foundation of the Gator Nation.  There is excitement in the walls and stands.  Gator fans make this a great venue.  The stadium is huge and the jumbotrons well located for all replays on the field.  The stadium also stays open for people to go and ""do stadiums"" which is running up and down the steps in the stands.  This is a popular thing to do in Gainesville."
9996,Date of experience: August 2013,4-Sep-13,SEC,Florida,5,Our son's 1st Gator Game!,First experience for our little guy. We visited daddy's old fraternity house and took pictures with Albert at the game. Making memories with our next generation of the Gator Nation Family!
9997,Date of experience: August 2013,2-Sep-13,SEC,Florida,3,The swamp,"Security is terrible people just sit basically where ever they wanted to. I had paid good money for my seats and we were squashed on the bleacher in section 40 row 10. It's ridiculous there are no ushers down there also, people use those seat cushions to make seats takes up a ton of space. The field is amazing I loved every minute of it. Hard to find parking got to get there earlier and they will tow your car they are not playing around. Seeing the gator in the middle of the field and the Florida gators was better then watching it on tv."
9998,Date of experience: December 2012,19-Aug-13,SEC,Florida,5,Awesome stadium,"The ""Swamp"" is definitely a hard-core spirited stadium. Where else can you find 90,000 Gator fans in one place?! The student section is quite hot during daytime games, but every seat in the house is pretty awesome. The school spirit is like none other...."
10000,Date of experience: October 2012,9-Aug-13,SEC,Florida,5,It's Great to be a Florida Gator!,"Having went to the University in the late 90's and early 00's, the home of the Gators is easily my favorite place to be on a Saturday.  When you enter the stadium you can't help but be overwhelmed with team spirit.  And this is either a great thing if you're a fan or student of UF, or a bad thing if you're an opponent.  I've been to the stadium 9 times and everytime I go, we win.  The only drawback is if it's an afternoon game in September or October and you're sitting in the sun, it can be brutally hot.  But that's a small price to pay to watch the mighty Gators!"
10002,Date of experience: September 2012,31-Jul-13,SEC,Florida,3,Where football is king,"We used to play tag football on this field when I was in college.  They don't let you do that anymore, but you can run the steps!!"
10014,Date of experience: October 2021,10-Oct-21,SEC,Kentucky,4,Nice Stadium for a Game,"Kroger field is a nice stadium, and most areas had a seat back, which is nice. They allow seat cushions to be brought inside the stadium. The screens are good and readable. The areas under the stadium are roomy and clean.  The only issue we encountered was not all vending carts take cards, so bring some cash. The people we encountered were friendly and weather and location was good. Parking around the stadium can be tricky and gets backed up in garages. If you Uber, plan to walk quite a ways away after the game to catch a ride."
10015,Date of experience: September 2020,17-Nov-20,SEC,Kentucky,5,No lines game day experience.,"We went for the UK-Vanderbilt game a little unsure due to Covid, but it was so seamless!  No lines or waiting for parking, entry or concessions.  All gates were open and the stadium capacity (20%) meant no one near us for the game.  I paced up and down our row freely with excitement as the game went on.  You will be much closer to people at grocery stores and not in the fresh air of the outdoors.  Definitely catch a game at Kroger Field!"
10016,Date of experience: December 2019,8-Dec-19,SEC,Kentucky,3,6A Title game.,"Decent view and easy parking but unless you buy reserved seats it??s a bit uncomfortable. At least they have plastic backs to protect your back but the metal bleacher seats are cold and uncomfortable. I??m sure it??s a little more hectic when the Cats play here and I gather a little more loud. However, I have been to other stadiums that are more comfortable."
10017,Date of experience: August 2019,19-Oct-19,SEC,Kentucky,4,Woodford Reserve Club,"The food and hospitality in the Woodford Reserve Club was amazing. This is the only way to see a game at Kroger Field. Hey, and the Cats won the game! In the club they have several food bars, and everything I had was great. It was extremely hot and the air conditioning was a welcomed retreat. They also had ice cream to cool us off. We had a great time, and will be back soon."
10018,Date of experience: October 2019,13-Oct-19,SEC,Kentucky,3,A little above average,"Spent a few days visiting the Lexington area, and everything is so well maintained and kept up that you come to expect it. We happened to be in town when Kentucky football had a game, so we decided to go. First, I'm not sure what your supposed to do about parking. Obviously we don't have any type of special parking pass, so we parked almost 1 mile away (maybe further)...and paid $10 to do so! Maybe there is a huge parking lot somehwere with a shuttle? As proud as people of Kentucky are for UK, I think I expected more from the stadium. The concourse is dull concrete,drab,  and actually depressing. It needs blue paint, posters hanging, some decent concessions, etc. The positives: I dont think there is a bad seat in the stadium. Fans were very into the game and supporting the team. They also were very friendly to out of town guests. Also it is fun to watch the pageantry before the game. I'd put it this way: concourse and parking could use improvement, but once inside seating area, its is great"
10019,Date of experience: October 2019,13-Oct-19,SEC,Kentucky,3,Not Uber Friendly!,"Despite the UK Athletics website's claim that they made it easy for Uber and Lyft pickups and drop-offs, this is simply not true.  The roads were blocked off or made one-way and our Uber driver had to drop us off several blocks from the stadium.  After the game we waited for Uber driver to find us for more than 45 minutes because the road on which we were supposed to meet had been turned into a one way street and he couldn't get to us.  Had no complaints about the venue itself, it just needs to be more accessible."
10020,Date of experience: September 2019,28-Sep-19,SEC,Kentucky,5,Football game,What a great place . Not a bad view from anywhere. Wish they would serve beer. Go cats and go bbn. Peace out uk
10021,Date of experience: September 2019,6-Sep-19,SEC,Kentucky,5,Great Experience,I purchased season tickets to UK football this season and my seats are upper level and are great.  Kroger field has upgraded alot since it was commonwealth stadium. Upgrades are very nice and is a great game experience.  Everything is easy to find and there isnt a bad seat in the house.  Plenty of concessions and everything is laid out nicely.  Been awhile since I went to a game there and I must say I enjoyed it and am looking forward to the next game.
10022,Date of experience: October 2018,4-Dec-18,SEC,Kentucky,4,Good Crowd,"A friend took us for UK homecoming weekend game and the view was fantastic, temperatures were low, parking and getting there could be a mess, but we planned well - ubering, etc...It is a little tricky to find your way around the seats when the stadium is full.  Popcorn, Papa Johns and prices were standard.  We had a nice time."
10023,Date of experience: November 2018,28-Nov-18,SEC,Kentucky,5,Home of the Wild Cats.,This stadium is smaller than a lot of the other SEC stadiums. I was never there before the stadium was remodeled. We were on the 50 yard line and our view was perfect. There was a good selection of fast foods.
10024,Date of experience: November 2018,7-Nov-18,SEC,Kentucky,5,Welcoming place,"We attended a UGA ?? UK football game. The stadium is smaller than the UGA one, but lovely and well maintained.  Although we were high up on row 208, we had a perfect view of the game.  We particularly liked experiencing the UK football traditions and could feel that their fans are as fervent as are UGA fans.  All the people we came in contact were lovely, including one person who told us as we walked by, ??Welcome, Georgia.??  That made us feel so wonderful."
10025,Date of experience: October 2018,23-Oct-18,SEC,Kentucky,5,Vandy v. UK Football Game,"First UK football home game I've attended in at least twenty years, was greatly impressed.  Traffic flow into, and especially out of, the stadium was quite good.  Parking was at a bit of a premium, but eventually (and also by accident) found an off street space at no cost.  Crowd seemed both friendly and well behaved with a good number of tailgaters.  Seats had a back rest, a real bonus.  Really enjoyed the game, despite the unbelievably strong winds throughout the game.   One of the best college football stadiums I've been to in recent years."
10026,Date of experience: September 2018,3-Sep-18,SEC,Kentucky,4,Good place for a game,"Traveled to Kentucky to see a game. This is a clean stadium, that was easy in and out. The food is a little high priced like most stadiums. The bench seat had a little back, which made them easier to sit on. The home fans were polite, we had several  fans wish a safe drive home, and thank us for driving down to visit."
10028,Date of experience: October 2017,8-Nov-17,SEC,Kentucky,4,New Name New Improvements,"Prior to an extensive renovation Kroger Field was known as Commonwealth Stadium.  There have been many improvements such as a new press box, box seats, club seats, a pavilion, suites, and some updates to bathrooms.  The field itself sports checkerboard patterned end zones with new scoreboards and lighting.  In spite of the $110 million renovation in 2015 and the more recent $6 million update cell phone service is still hit or miss and the sound system is horrible.  We have season tickets to the UK football games and the speakers on one end of the field don't work at all.  Hope they get this issue fixed soon.  It is the only reason for not giving it an excellent rating."
10029,Date of experience: September 2021,10-Sep-21,SEC,Missouri,4,M-I Z  Z-O-U!!,"Mizzou was our  (long-delayed) choice for our annual  Labor Day college  football  trip  (postponed  from  2020),  but  Faurot  Field  was  a  real  treat  to  attend.   The  morning  rain  subsided  on  9/4/2021,  and  we  enjoyed  the  game  immensely  (although  the  game  was  3 hours,  48  minutes  long!!).  We  sat  in  Section  124,  had  a  fine  view  of  the  game,  Mizzou  won, and  overall it  was  a  great  afternoon.     A  few  issues:  Since  Faurot  had  not  been  fully  attended  since  2019  (46,000 + at our game),  the  stadium  concession  stands  were  not  fully prepared......fairly  long  lines  on  the  home  side.   We  also  had  some  minor  issues  getting  into  the stadium  with  our  electronic  tickets,  but  this  was  a  small  problem.  Overall,  a  great  experience  at  an  SEC  stadium.   Go  Mizzou!"
10030,Date of experience: September 2020,7-Oct-20,SEC,Missouri,5,First visit to Faurot Field for an SEC Game,"Enjoyed my first visit to Faurot Field.  The parking was easy, the stadium was comfortable and a great place to see a game.  Looking forward to going back."
10032,Date of experience: November 2019,25-Nov-19,SEC,Missouri,5,Amazing!,What an amazing stadium! The layout was spacious with multiple eateries. Loved the huge M in the grassy knoll.
10033,Date of experience: October 2019,11-Nov-19,SEC,Missouri,5,Awesome Upgrades,"A clean, state of the art stadium now offering table seating. Parking is often difficult and pricey. Good food options available."
10034,Date of experience: October 2019,21-Oct-19,SEC,Missouri,5,Go Tigers!,It??s always a fun day spending time with the family but watching our Tigers win against South Carolina made it even better. The new addition to Faurot Field makes it easy to have a good view from anywhere in the stadium.
10036,Date of experience: September 2019,26-Sep-19,SEC,Missouri,5,First visit after the renovations,The renovations make the stadium look new and fresh.  The video board is huge.  And it is fun to be able to completely walk around the inside now.  The atmosphere was great.  The food was ok and priced ok.  Get your beer outside. It is several $$ cheaper
10037,Date of experience: September 2019,25-Sep-19,SEC,Missouri,5,We lost the game but had a great time!,"Along with a busload of South Carolina fans, we recently attended the USC vs. UM football game at Faurot Field and had a great time, despite the threat of rain and the result of the game!  Starting things off, it sometimes is a long walk from the parking areas at away games but UM has that covered very well.  Our bus parked at the Truman Landing lot where a free shuttle bus takes fans to the game and picks them up afterward.  There were two buses that served our lot and they ran about every 15 minutes.  There are ample concession stands and restrooms and the fans were great, with one offering to take our photo when we were about to try a selfie with the ""M"" in the background.  MU has also made some recent improvements with special seating that includes some half-round tables with four seats that were impressive.  Once back at the parking lot, another Missouri fan waved me over and offered me a Cornish ""Gamecock"" Hen -- one of many that he had prepared that morning!  It was delicious!  Thanks Missourians for being such great hosts and I will try to return the favor when y'all come to Williams Brice next year!"
10039,Date of experience: September 2018,3-Feb-19,SEC,Missouri,3,M-I-Z!!!,"Home of the MU Tigers, presently battling probation, Faurot is a nice place to watch a football game. In-seat vending is minimal, and it can be a long walk to a concession stand, so eat ahead of time or bring somebody who doesn't care to miss part of the game to get you snacks."
10040,Date of experience: November 2018,8-Nov-18,SEC,Missouri,5,Sitting on the grassy hill with my Mizzou daughter,"Spent a nice warm Saturday watching a Mizzou football game from the grassy hill is the best.  Facilities were clean, fan s were nice, and the employees profesional.  Can't wait to go back!"
10041,Date of experience: September 2018,15-Sep-18,SEC,Missouri,4,Go Tigers!!!,"Always a great time at Faurot Field. The field has great views from just about every seat and the band and cheer leaders, and of course, The Golden Girls, are always entertaining. Good family atmosphere."
10042,Date of experience: October 2017,8-Jul-18,SEC,Missouri,5,Great sporting environment,Faurot Field has some of the best fans in the world. This is the way Football is meant to be enjoyed. Walking to the stadium with friends and tailgating before the game all add to the experience. Seats are not super comfy but if you are like me I spend a lot of the game in my feet. This stadium actually has the highest capacity in the state of Missouri higher than even Arrowhead Stadium. Games typically take 3 hours or so but the memories last forever.
10043,Date of experience: September 2017,21-Jan-18,SEC,Missouri,5,M-I-Z Baby!,"Though the stadium is rather old, and maybe in need of a bit of a modern update. That being said when Mizzou's football team is good, there is nothing quite like half of the stadium yelling MIZ followed by a ZOU from the other side!! :D"
10044,Date of experience: November 2017,19-Nov-17,SEC,Missouri,4,Tennessee-Missouri game 11/11/17,"Got to watch my beloved VOLS play in yet another SEC stadium. If the lights weren't on, you could miss the stadium. It blends in with the surrounding area. And the crowd was far from record setting. I would venture to guess 20,000 empty seats, which was a little bit surprising since it was Senior night. But everyone knows where you are when you see the big white rock M behind the end zone! Wish the outcome was better for my boys, but it was a good night for the home team."
10045,Date of experience: September 2017,11-Oct-17,SEC,Missouri,5,Auburn v. Missouri - Kansas City Auburn Alumni Club,"Wonderful visit!  Set up tailgate early by Parking Structure #7.  Met a ton of super nice folks - on both dudes of the contest.  Really nice Mizzou fans, friendly but they don??t impose on one??s activity. Concessions are a little Little in the visitors section (south end zone); so, expect to wait.  Very clean."
10046,Date of experience: September 2017,5-Oct-17,SEC,Missouri,3,Very nice people,Great people to visit for a game.  Not the best tailgating or updated stadium like many in the SEC but the people are some of the best.
10047,Date of experience: September 2017,2-Oct-17,SEC,Missouri,5,Great game,"We traveled here for a football not knowing anything about the area. Parking was very easy, not cheap, $25.00 but we parked across the street from the stadium which was nice. The stadium was beautiful, clean, had several food options. We had a great time and would go again."
10048,Date of experience: September 2017,27-Sep-17,SEC,Missouri,3,Average Power 5 Stadium...but People are 5 Starts,"Concourses are tight...very tight.  No concessions in South Endzone, so you have major congestion at concessions and restrooms adjacent to the South EZ.  Food choices are pretty generic.  I was hoping to find a Booches/Shakespeare/etc food truck/cart, but couldn't.  The Mizzou people couldn't have been better.  All were great.  Very hospitable."
10049,Date of experience: September 2016,31-Mar-17,SEC,Missouri,4,The Zou,"Any Mizzou Tiger reveres the Zou. It is fairly large stadium oriented north south. As such, the East side can be blisteringly hot in the September afternoon games. All the seats are tight, and when the place is full, it can be pretty exciting. This is no dome, and unless you are privileged to sit in a box, you get what the weather provides. Halftimes feature the great Marching Mizzou band. Stadium food is average, restrooms are pretty gross, with very long lines for the women. No adult beverages allowed, and if you leave during the game, you can't get back in. Parking lot parties, and they handle the traffic pretty well."
10050,Date of experience: October 2016,24-Mar-17,SEC,Missouri,5,"Getting to know the ""Show Me"" state","I'll always remember Farout Field at the University of Missouri because I got my first speeding ticket while driving from St. Louis to see a football game in Columbia, Missouri. I'll never forget the experience because it was a speed trap and the state policeman let another driver go because he claimed he couldn't speak English. Go figure. Faurot Field, named for coach Don Faurot, who put Missouri's football program on the map in the 1940s and was recognized as the father of the split-T offense, has changed dramatically since my visit in 1967--except for one significant thing, something that sets Faurot Field apart from other college stadiums. The traditional black ""M,"" carved from stone by the freshman class in 1927, guards the stadium's north end zone and gives Faurot Field one of the more unique landmarks around the country. The ""M,"" formed by whitewashed rocks, is 90 feet wide and 95 feet high. In 2013, the hill upon which the ""M"" is laid was moved closer to the field to allow for an expansion of the north concourse area, proving more space for fans to gather during games. But Faurot Field underwent more upgrades in 2014, including a spacious upper deck and lounge/club level and 1,200 luxury seats that increased the stadium's capacity to 71,168. I've often wondered if my $25 speeding ticket helped to fund the project."
10051,Date of experience: October 2016,1-Jan-17,SEC,Missouri,4,Mizzou Football Stadium,"A truly pretty setting on a fall day as the tree colors south of the stadium are visable from every seat except the south end zone. The whitewashed rock ""M"" at the north end of the field is recognized across the country.  Restrooms and concessions should be upgraded."
10052,Date of experience: October 2016,22-Dec-16,SEC,Missouri,5,Great Football Event!!!,Had the chance to go there and watch a college football game and absolutely loved it! The Mizzou fans have to be some of the nicest fans out there and have great hospitality skills. The seats were great and the atmosphere was electric! A must do as a college football fan!
10053,Date of experience: September 2022,27-Sep-22,SEC,Oklahoma,4,OU GAME,"Not a bad seat in da house. We sat all the way at the top in the end zone. 87,000 people at the game, not hard getting in, but driving home at the end of the game was terrible. They need to do better with traffic!!!"
10055,Date of experience: October 2021,28-Mar-22,SEC,Oklahoma,4,Crazy Experience,"My dad and I have always gone to the home games, and it is always a great time. The ticket lines move so quickly when going in, and when leaving it is always organized well. Most generally it is clean, and you always see someone cleaning something with is a good feeling. It is a football game, and crowded, but always worth the experience!"
10056,Date of experience: November 2021,21-Jan-22,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Boom Sooner,"Haven't been to a game?  This is an absolute must.  The best fans, friendly town and the band... Oh my goodness."
10057,Date of experience: October 2021,16-Oct-21,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Boomer Sooner,"It is so fun!! The fans are awesome! It??s for all ages. One thing, Oklahoma Sooners are great at football! So that makes it more fun!!"
10058,Date of experience: September 2021,24-Sep-21,SEC,Oklahoma,1,Yesterday??s Waffle House Burgers are Better Than Stadium Food at OU!,I have been a season ticket holder for over 30 years.  Concession food has always been marginal as far back as I can remember but never good.  You would think a place like the home of Oklahoma football would do something to make the fans proud. After all There is Only One Oklahoma! ?? It is so bad this year that I am making sure I plan to not be hungry before I go to the game.  THE FOOD IS JUST PLAIN BAD.Concessions should be special at OU on game day.  There should be some special items that reflect Oklahoma and all the food should be good to great.
10060,Date of experience: October 2020,18-Jan-21,SEC,Oklahoma,5,MOST FUN place to watch OU Football!,We've been going to the stadium for YEARS and love it!  SO READY to get back after Covid!  It's always fun to hang out with friends and watch the mighty Sooners play football!
10061,Date of experience: December 2020,13-Dec-20,SEC,Oklahoma,4,Boomer Sooner,"Went to OU-Baylor during the COVID pandemic.  OU did a fantastic job spacing seats.  We were very comfortable with the crowd level at the game.  Very enjoyable evening.  Would have liked to see the OU band and all the pageantry of the typical game day experience, but happy to just get the chance to see any OU football during COVID."
10062,Date of experience: November 2020,22-Nov-20,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Loved it,"Bedlam game 2020. Awesome place, had every one spread out, so we weren??t sitting close to any one. Very clean. Staff was nice."
10063,Date of experience: December 2018,6-Nov-19,SEC,Oklahoma,4,Cyndy,"If you know Oklahoma you know we love football. Especially the Oklahoma Sooners playing in the beautiful Owens Stadium. Right across from the iconic Campus Corner are lots of amazing restaurant, boutiques, banks and bars."
10064,Date of experience: September 2019,29-Sep-19,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Great BIG 12 football atmosphere,This historic stadium has been expanded and looks great!  Great seats or suites depending on your budget. Great tailgating and pre game festivities at Campus Corner.
10065,Date of experience: September 2019,9-Sep-19,SEC,Oklahoma,1,Horrible Seating!,"I am a lifelong Sooners football fan and decided to enjoy a game on Sept 7, 2019.  We felt fortunate to find affordable seats, even though it was on the visitors' side but that didn't matter because I expected that 95% of the stadium would be full of Sooners fans.  We sat in section 32, row 17 which is quite close to the 40 yard line and near the sideline.Unfortunately, we found the bench style stadium seating to be so close that you couldn't sit without your knees crammed against the person in front.  And then the folks behind you have their knees in your back.  You can appreciate airline coach seats after an experience like this.  It was hot and crowded so nobody wanted to sit down for longer than two minutes.  It was impossible to see the field or get comfortable let alone try to have a cool soft drink because there wasn't room to maneuver your arms.  And it was too hot to stand in the sun.  After one frustrating quarter, my left leg became numb and my wife was in such pain from trying to get halfway comfortable.  We finally decided to leave before the end of first half.Don't get me wrong... I love the Sooners and their football program but I won't return to Memorial Stadium.  Why on earth would they pack the seats so closely together that you can't sit without pain?  I'm not oversized... 5-10 and 180 lbs.  It was horrible and I just can't recommend spending hundreds of dollars to feel like you are stuffed in the trunk of a compact car.A couple years' back, we sat in the end zone and that wasn't too comfortable but it wasn't painful.  I don't know if the seating is different depending on the sections or if they'd changed the configuration.  When I describe our experience above, it is not an exaggeration.  It was horrible and I'll stay at home to watch on television from this point on."
10066,Date of experience: September 2019,8-Sep-19,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Great game experience,I thought the game presentation was one of the best I've ever seen for a college game. All of the fans were very friendly - and passionate! There was plenty to watch aside from the football game!
10067,Date of experience: August 2019,3-Sep-19,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Great Stadium,The Oklahoma Memorial Stadium is always an exciting place to visit.  The views are good from all locations and the visual affects make it more engaging.
10068,Date of experience: September 2019,3-Sep-19,SEC,Oklahoma,5,OU FOOTBALL,amazing stadium. It takes no time to get into the stadium because there are so my gates. Concessions good. Amazing TV screens. Always enjoy my experience.
10073,Date of experience: September 2018,19-Mar-19,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Always fun,"I guess it??s less fun if they lose, but that isn??t often. Seats are comfortable. Food is good. Not terribly expensive for concessions."
10074,Date of experience: November 2018,9-Mar-19,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Girls Trip OU GAME,This is one of my FAVORITE places to be!! I love the excitement and facility! The prices are what you??d expect at any stadium. Just a tip you can??t take in a bag unless it??s see through. Don??t waste your money on a new bag before the game unless it??s clear. But the shopping experience before is a must!! So fun!
10075,Date of experience: October 2018,22-Feb-19,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Sooners home field is the place for football,"Besides the football, lots more food choices than in previous years - but of course campus corner is just 200 yards north!  Going to experiment with alcohol at the games - that should be interesting"
10076,Date of experience: October 2018,20-Feb-19,SEC,Oklahoma,5,So cool!,"They don't call it the Palace on the Prairie for nothing! What an amazing stadium! Went to the K St vs. OU game just because I am a fan of college football and wanted to watch a game at the stadium. It did not disappoint! Would love to go to another game at this place, everyone was so friendly!"
10077,Date of experience: October 2018,17-Jan-19,SEC,Oklahoma,4,Oklahoma football at its finest,"Excellent football   Now with the new additions, extra seating, more bathrooms and better concession places. You just can??t beat this place.   This is the place to be for college football"
10078,Date of experience: October 2018,11-Dec-18,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Great Morher Daughter Day,My daughter and I went to the OU vs OSU game and it was fantastic!! The employees were friendly and helpful and the whole experience was great! And we won!!
10079,Date of experience: November 2018,28-Nov-18,SEC,Oklahoma,5,So. Much.  Fun.,"Crowded as all get out, but a good time, every time!  Get there early to watch the OU Pride parade before every home game!"
10080,Date of experience: November 2018,16-Nov-18,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Great Stadium,"This is one of the greatest football stadium in the country with a long history.  The new club seats are very nice with food buffet, cash bar and climate controlled food court."
10081,Date of experience: November 2018,12-Nov-18,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Finally took the whole family,My boys finally got to see what big time college football atmosphere is like. They had a great time and cant wait to go back. I live in Georgia now and it is nice to get back to Norman. Everyone is so nice. Tailgating is excellent and you cannot beat the atmosphere in the stadium.
10082,Date of experience: September 2018,6-Nov-18,SEC,Oklahoma,5,OU Football,"Great fans, great atmosphere.  Great example of what big time college football should be.  Tailgating is great, friendly/family atmosphere.  Only negative is the students arrive late and leave early."
10083,Date of experience: September 2018,29-Oct-18,SEC,Oklahoma,5,OU Experience,First OU game and we fell in love! Seating is a little cramped but enjoyed every other aspect of the experience.
10084,Date of experience: November 2017,2-Oct-18,SEC,Oklahoma,5,BOOMER SOONER,This venue is electrifying. Sitting in the stadium is excitement like you will never get from watching a Sooner Football game on TV. If you have never been to a game you must go at least once.
10085,Date of experience: September 2018,29-Sep-18,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Another Win for OU!!!,"This place is a blast! Tailgaters all around, folks are just friendly! Today we played Baylor. Tried they did, we beat them 66 to 33. Staff was quick to get folks through security and inside. The facilities are cleaned and maintained. The food facilities are quick! Boomer Sooner!"
10086,Date of experience: September 2018,25-Sep-18,SEC,Oklahoma,5,LOVE Oklahoma Sooners Football,"We traveled from Houston, TX for the Sooners vs Army game on 9/22/18.   We were in Section 18, Row 63.  Had a great view of the entire field.  We were tightly packed in with 87,000 of our Sooner (and Army) friends - with very little leg room to speak of - but we spent a lot of time cheering our Sooners on!  Everyone was friendly from the front gate attendants, the police officers, the food and drink vendors, the seat back people and the program people.   Drinks were $5.00 each - soda, water, frozen lemonade - all $5.  Game was exciting against Army.  There were jumpers that parachuted into the stadium and a huge American Flag stretched across the field.  A great place to spend a few bucks and support THE Oklahoma Sooners!I parked at Lloyd Noble Center and took the shuttle to a spot a few blocks from the stadium.  Cost of the shuttle was $5 for a round-trip ticket.  However, after the game, the line for the shuttle was blocks long, so we walked the mile back to the car.  Getting out of Lloyd Noble took around 40 minutes.  Traffic was thick."
10087,Date of experience: September 2018,14-Sep-18,SEC,Oklahoma,5,The Palace on the Prairie,"There's nothing like watching a Great Team in a Great Stadium. We usually sit in the section 227/228 great view of the entire field. A little distance from the action but you will not miss anything being in the upper deck with the replays being shown on the massive video board. The walk up the ramp to the upper deck takes awhile, but you will get the benefit of chair backs, cup holders, and less crowded concessions and bathrooms up there. Last game we sat in section 22. Closer to the action so a better view (right behind the tunnel where the Sooner Schooner comes on and off the field), but everyone squeezes in on the bench seats down there. There's not a bad seat in the place, but there are better. The Santee Lounge seats are the best. Located about 45 rows up in the middle sections on the west side of the field, you get the best views, you get chair backs and they are covered so you are out of the sun and rain. You also get free food and drinks in the lounge, everything but alcohol (at least for now)."
10088,Date of experience: September 2018,10-Sep-18,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Sooner Football Game VS UCLA,"Everything was great, I loved the environment and customer services was outstanding. What a great experience."
10089,Date of experience: August 2018,27-Aug-18,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Home of the Sooners,"If you like exciting football and comfortable surroundings, this is the place for your and your team or family to visit.   Their wonderful college atmosphere is unsurpassed. Our son loved being a team student manager."
10090,Date of experience: November 2017,27-Aug-18,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Awesome place!,I have attended OU Football games here since I was a teenager and watched it grow. It has become a CFC world class stadium with first class facilities.
10092,Date of experience: September 2017,6-Aug-18,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Not a bad seat in the palace on the prarie,"The stadium is the home to the greatest football program in the land. Not a bad seat in the place, but some are simply amazing. Drinks are 5 bucks, The food prices vary but its all tasty -- Get a ticket and you won't be disappointed"

Usually a loud and friendly crowd with a great entertainment extras wrapped around usually great football.  If you can get a ticket...go and enjoy...not too many bad seats at all!"
10095,Date of experience: October 2017,22-Jul-18,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Must-see for football fans,"A great college football experience.  We were there on a rainy day, so the tailgating, etc. wasn't what I expect it would be normally.  But enthusiastic crowd, lots of tradition.  And of course, the Sooners usually win!"
10097,Date of experience: October 2017,20-Jul-18,SEC,Oklahoma,5,1st OU game,"What an awesome experience. Had so much fun here. Would definitely recommend getting tickets and coming to watch an OU game. Wish they allowed in stadium drinking though. Of course with any stadium, food is expensive. Eat plenty before hand."
10098,Date of experience: November 2017,18-Jun-18,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Football Fun,I've been to at least 100 OU football games here.  Can't imagine being anywhere else during a home game!
10099,Date of experience: December 2017,30-May-18,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Best College football Atmosphere,I am biased. However since the closing of the south end to turn the stadium into a full bowl there have been other wonderful changes. The new south end with the coaching statues and the Switzerland center is first rate. Letting food trucks serve inside the stadium was a greater plus along with the standard chain foods. Largest big screen in college football and fans that are friendly and proud of their Sooners.
10101,Date of experience: October 2017,1-Apr-18,SEC,Oklahoma,4,Attending a game or just visiting the campus Oklahoma Memorial Stadium is a must see while in Norman!!!,"The campus of OU is beautiful. Yes, the stadium was expanded to add extra seats to OU fans and very impressive. So much history in the walls of this stadium but just remember with some new construction it is still a stadium . I promise you will not be disappointed with OU fans. Loud and Proud!!"
10102,Date of experience: November 2017,4-Mar-18,SEC,Oklahoma,5,A Sooner fan must see,Attending a game at Memorial stadium is required for any fan of the Sooners.  The energy of the fans and student section is great.  Visiting teams are generally treated well.
10103,Date of experience: November 2017,4-Mar-18,SEC,Oklahoma,1,Uppity overpriced,"The season ticket prices and ""contribution"" to get these tickets are outrageous. They updated the south end zone with the promise that the west stand upper deck would get improved amenities...it did not. If you want decent food you have to walk down 21 switchback ramps and then climb backup the switchback ramps. All that work to sit down and listen to vulgar or violent rap music. We have hung up our tickets and tell ya to find another sucker to support your idolotrious behavior. Stoops ad used to open the game with a ""gamblers anonymous"" type ad and the stadium has Riverwind Casino ads all around. Send your money to some Veterans group to support our Vet's, or your charity of choice. Unless you can pay the bigger bucks for east side ""club"" tickets plan on burning up or freezing your hungry buns off!"
10105,Date of experience: September 2017,22-Jan-18,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Not a bad seat in the house,"Going to OU games is uniquely Norman, the stadium is great and the atmosphere is fun, there isn't a person who isn't welcome and everyone is sure to have a good time (unless your the visiting team! JK)"
10106,Date of experience: October 2017,3-Jan-18,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Always a good view,We enjoy going to the football games.  We have sat in various sections and always thought the view was great.
10107,Date of experience: November 2017,13-Nov-17,SEC,Oklahoma,5,OU - Owens Stadium,"The football stadium on the campus has gone through a lot of changes over the last 50 years. I first saw the stadium my freshman year at The University of Oklahoma in 1967 and went to the OU -TCU game this weekend and what a wonderful place to watch a football game. I have seen all the upgrades to the stadium these past 50 years and it just keeps getting better. Over 88,500 were at the game and it was great. Nothing like it if you are a Sooner fan."
10108,Date of experience: November 2017,9-Nov-17,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Clean with nice amenities.,Always a good time. Good restaurant vendors. Clean bathrooms. Seats and benches are well kept. Great audio-visual set up.
10109,Date of experience: October 2017,8-Nov-17,SEC,Oklahoma,5,"Best stadium, team, and fans ever!","We've been going to this stadium my entire life.  It's great! Very clean and modern. The expansion really helped! I recommend the club seats in the south end zone if you get a chance! How can you not like this place? It is, after all, the home The Oklahoma Sooners!!"
10110,Date of experience: October 2017,5-Nov-17,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Great place and many memories,I went to OU so this place will always have a special place in my heart.  While the stadium seating has expanded in the 39 years since I was a freshman the underneath concessions look to be about the same. Husband wasn't too impressed with them but I told them that people tailgate for their food and drink and come here for the game. The restrooms were clean.  The PA announcer was easy to understand and the big screens were nice.  We had bench seats on the west side and rented seats for $10 that we had to drag up to our seats ourselves which was a hassle.  I see you can preorder the cushion seats and they will be waiting for you.  We parked at Lloyd Noble which was free and took the bus that was $5 each way (about a 3 block walk to pick up and drop off site but they offer closer in for disabilities and senior citizens).  We stayed for 30 minutes with our relatives who were tailgating at LN after the game and then had zero problem leaving with traffic.  For me it was a great memory out of my past!
10111,Date of experience: October 2017,4-Nov-17,SEC,Oklahoma,5,College Football in Oklahoma,This stadium is on par with one for a professional football organization.  Very modern with many amenitites.  Some esculators available for reach higher lever seating.  Great variety of food concessons.

I read through a few reviews, and did not have the same experience as one gentlemen who ranked this stadium a 2 stars. Fans were polite. We were part of the home team. The stadium was not too loud. If you want loud and unruly, go to a West Virginia game. Those fans are passionate, they even burn couches!Every single person was polite and helpful. Food was on average as far as price and availability. We never waited more than a minute or two in line for food. Traffic leaving took about 20 minutes to get through. At no time was anyone rude. Everyone was polite, all in the same boat, and nobody cut anyone else off. Oklahoma and Kansas as a whole has a lot better drivers, than many other states, as I have lived in 7 across the country, and driven through 46. This was fully worth the trip!"
10113,Date of experience: September 2017,12-Oct-17,SEC,Oklahoma,2,"Terrible traffic, rude fans","Hadn't been to this stadium in over 13 years until this season. Same ole, same ole. The traffic is horrendous as its always been and if you're not cheering for OU (either as an opposing fan or just an average bystander) they can be a little much. Unless I'm getting paid I tend to stay away."
10114,Date of experience: October 2017,7-Oct-17,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Best Place in Country to watch a college football game,We live this place. They have an awesome job of adding new vendors and food trucks. The atmosphere is electric and the people are very good fans.
10115,Date of experience: September 2017,20-Sep-17,SEC,Oklahoma,5,This Aggie Was Impressed - Boomer Sooner!  Gig 'em Aggies!,"I have visited Memorial Stadium twice before this past weekend.  Both times I accompanied the Texas Aggie Band, and watched our team get pounded.  No hard feelings.  I was the guest of Mr. Lonnie Childress this weekend for the Tulane game.  We served together in the U. S. Army back in the early '70s.  He invited me to join him in the East Club and a pre-game tailgate.  I even got to sit with Mr. Rick Knapp, Executive Director of the OU QB Club.  Classy guy.  I was treated very well by Sooner fans, and was impressed by the game day atmosphere.  Your stadium isn't over the top glitzy, but exudes an aura of champions.  I've long been a big fan of Bob Stoops.  I was sad to see him retire.  Your campus is simply beautiful.  Be proud of it.  One thing we have in common is our mutual hatred for that school down in Austin.  You are classy fans.  The sips don't have a clue.  Beat the Hell outta t.u.!!  I've added several new photos that I took.  Hope you enjoy them.  Gig 'em and Boomer Sooner!"

10119,Date of experience: September 2016,27-Jul-17,SEC,Oklahoma,5,One of the must see College Football venues,"The University of Oklahoma has played football on this hallowed spot for 100 years. Originally a modest horseshoe, it has been expanded numerous times with a 1970s west upper deck, an east side addition in 2000s and most recently a complete enclosure to form the current bowl in 2016. State of the art amenities and athletic facilities within will make it a top destination for fans and players alike."

One of the best things about OU is watching football.  The stadium is a classic, and the recent addition is very welcome."
10125,Date of experience: December 2016,17-Mar-17,SEC,Oklahoma,5,One of the true meccas of college football,"This is truly one of the bucket list places to see a college football game.  With recent renovations, it is now one of the nicest places to see a college football game too.  On game days, this temporarily becomes the third largest city in Oklahoma.Don't expect to sit quietly, though."
10126,Date of experience: November 2016,8-Mar-17,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Just had a make over last year,This is the Temple of the Gods of OU football and their fans.. a pure must see and as red and white as it gets

10130,Date of experience: October 2016,14-Dec-16,SEC,Oklahoma,4,Boomer Sooner OU,I had the pleasure of watching my first NCAA football game at this stadium.  The energy of the residents of Oklahoma is something I have not experienced before. The community rallied around and supported this team like it was the NFL. I had a great time. OU won too!~ go Sooner Boomer
10131,Date of experience: October 2016,7-Dec-16,SEC,Oklahoma,3,Great New Stadium,"The new stadium is super to see & much different. Worth the trip. Prices are still quite high, but I have come to expect that after going to the football games for over 40 years"
10132,Date of experience: November 2016,2-Dec-16,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Very first visit!,I have made several trips to visit kid at OU and sorry to say that I have never been to a game.Sat in the student section and all was awesome. I really like the proximity to the field as you can really hear and feel the action on the field.I would love to enjoy another game here!
10134,Date of experience: October 2016,22-Nov-16,SEC,Oklahoma,5,OU vs Kansas Homecoming 2016,Excellent stadium and great place to watch a college football team.  The excitement in the air is great on game day. They closed in south end zone so now it is a complete bowl and it added additional cheats.
10135,Date of experience: November 2016,19-Nov-16,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Awesome!,"We're parents of a freshman and this was our first game in the stadium.  Loved the food choices and plentiful restrooms.  Most seating is on bleachers.  Suggest taking a stadium seat with a back, or rent one there ($10)"
10136,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Nov-16,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Awesome mood,"Went to watch the Sooners vs the Baylor . That was my first American football match n I totally enjoyed it. The pizza we bought during the game day was very good too. The place was just huge, can accommodate about 86000 people."
10137,Date of experience: November 2016,13-Nov-16,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Boomer Sooner - stadium visit,"This was out first home game since the field was surOUnded.  Really like the new look of the south end zone.  We parked in university parking just off university drive across from Campus Corner (first time to try) it was fine.  Just as convienet as other locations we've used.  Also learning, Boyd is now closed between the north oval and the engineering buildings on game days."
10138,Date of experience: October 2016,18-Oct-16,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Sooner nation,"When in Oklahoma.....this is a must do. The Sooners are amazing and going to a game is so special. We bought tickets in the club section. Our tickets included the buffet style meal. Although they seemed a little disorganized at delivering the food, watching the game was the focal point."
10139,Date of experience: October 2016,18-Oct-16,SEC,Oklahoma,5,OK Memorial Stadium is better than ever!,"I attended the OU vs K State game last Saturday and had the pleasure to visit the South Club.  It is located in the newly renovated south end zone of the stadium.  It has beautiful and clean bathrooms, beer for purchase and a free buffet.  The day we attended, it was an 11 o'clock game, so there were breakfast foods plus a taco bar.  The food was delicious and fresh.  The employees were friendly and helpful.  The view of the game from our seats was great.  If the weather got a little warm, you could always cool off in the South Club.  It was a great experience and I highly recommend you try it sometime!"
10140,Date of experience: October 2016,17-Oct-16,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Great atmosphere!  New South End Zone amazing!!,Love the changes that have been made to the south end zone..  Really ties the whole stadium together!!  Loved taking my son to the game - he was so excited!!

Construction is almost complete on the new south end-zone and suites, and that Jumbotron on the south end is the craziest thing I've ever seen!  Love me some SOONER football!!"
10142,Date of experience: September 2016,22-Sep-16,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Right atmosphere to to watch college football,Great stadium to watch a college football game my friends and I were in town to see Ohio State versus Oklahoma full house and did not look like they had any bad seats easy access plenty of bathrooms the ability to get in and out rather quickly.
10143,Date of experience: September 2016,19-Sep-16,SEC,Oklahoma,4,The Sooner Stadium!,Oklahoma Memorial Stadium has recently been remodeled and now totally enclosed.  The screen is large and the sound system is good.  Game day is an exciting adventure for our family.  Boomer Sooner!
10144,Date of experience: September 2016,19-Sep-16,SEC,Oklahoma,5,New Renovations look great!,"Season ticket holder for 20 years and I can't tell you how magnificent the stadium looks on the south end! And, it is truly louder in the stadium than before--that was evident at the Ohio State debacle. Nevertheless, I was excited to see the changes and to hear the upgrade of the sound and video too. I sit in the north end and it was noticeably better. Go Sooners!"
10145,Date of experience: September 2016,18-Sep-16,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Great stadium and venue for college football,"We attended the Oklahoma vs. Ohio State game.  The stadium has a spectacular  jumbotron, stadium seats as opposed to bench seats, great sight lines, and a great college atmosphere.  It is a great stop for any college football fan."
10146,Date of experience: September 2016,18-Sep-16,SEC,Oklahoma,5,OKLAHOMA V OHIO STATE FOOTBALL GAME,"Our seats were located in the upper level on the West side.The hike up the ramp is never a challenge. For ADA needs, there is an elevator on the ground level.The stadium has been enclosed, at the south end, which intensifies the noise during the game.  The new BIG screen, at the south end, is awesome.  Compared to the prior screen, this unit is very clear, bright, and has good video appearance.Good venue for college football."
10147,Date of experience: September 2016,18-Sep-16,SEC,Oklahoma,4,A Fun Game,"The stadium is really nice. We had seats on the very top of the stadium so we could see everything.  The facility is quite beautiful and clean, but many of people who work there are clueless.  They don't know where things are, few could help a visitor to find anything - they were, however, all friendly.  We had trouble finding water to refill our water bottles - many could not tell us how to reach the ramp to the top level.  The speakers sound didn't reach the seats in 227.  We couldn't hear most of what was being announced. Still, we enjoyed our experience, probably because we won!"
10148,Date of experience: September 2016,13-Sep-16,SEC,Oklahoma,3,Owen Field is now enclosed,"I am a season ticket holder. After the renovation I am glad to still have my original seats. To experience OU football in person is special. I do have a complaint. There is a roof top that doesn't allow for us to see the bottom of one of the nation's largest jumbo screens. Other than that, I love the stadium and its atmosphere."
10149,Date of experience: September 2016,13-Sep-16,SEC,Oklahoma,4,OU home opener,"For a first game in the new stadium things went fairly well. There was a bottleneck at the SE entrance, but once we finally got in we were able to locate our seats fairly easily with the help of the usher in that area. I hadn't been to a game in more than six years, so the changes from what I previously experienced were remarkable. Concessions and restrooms are greatly improved. Our seats were in the south end zone, so we had to turn around to see the jumbotron and we couldn't view the bottom of it from where we sat. Overall experience was good and our team won!"
10150,Date of experience: September 2016,13-Sep-16,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Gameday - Boomer Sooners,"Overall review of the new Stadium since the South end zone was enclosed and the new scoreboard was lit up is nothing less than awesome.  Packed with 87,000, Sooner Nation is alive on Saturdays.  Great atmosphere, great tradition and good times... So far my wife and I are 3 year season ticket holders and have never been disappointed traveling to Norman for Gameday, except when it rains, haha...  Campus corner is alive and the surrounding areas are abuzz!   Get out to a game and enjoy!!"
10151,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,SEC,Oklahoma,4,OU VS ULM - Sept 9th,"Get there early if you want to park reasonably close to the stadium. Not 20-30 minutes early; more like 1.5-2 hours early. If you intend on beating the tailgaters, it's more like 3 hours early. Many of the streets are blocked off by police well before you get to the stadium. This turns the surrounding neighborhood into a giant, maze-like parking lot and navigating the area becomes a snail-paced, grueling, stop-n-go drive that is tolerable if you know what to expect, left with time to spare and enjoy people watching. After our 40 minute circuitous venture, we parked 3 blocks away and arrived at the stadium at 5:15pm. We were in our seats by 5:30pm and the game started at 6pm.The stadium is large and it's also really nice. There are not individual seats, it's a bench all the way down the row. So, take your stadium seats/cushions with you or you can rent them while you're there. We were in Section 9, Row 9 which were pretty good seats and we had our own stadium seats. We were right at the 10 and could see both screens really well. This side of the stadium is behind the team; the band sits on the opposite side.If you need something from the concession stand, get it before the game .... They run out of stuff and the lines are horribly long. I have no idea what the restrooms are like because we didn't use them. But, there are benches in the grassy area outside the stadium at Gate 7, so it's a nice spot to meet up with friends who are coming separately."
10152,Date of experience: September 2016,10-Sep-16,SEC,Oklahoma,5,OU vs ULM,"New enclosed endzone/suites, new food vendors.  Great fan experience except for all the road construction.

10154,Date of experience: November 2015,10-Sep-16,SEC,Oklahoma,3,Hoboterp,"Not a very up to date stadium . This place need a boat load of work . From the seats to the bathrooms. Kind of strange that the majority of fans 90% are not students. For 80,000 plus the stadium is not very loud . If you have attended games in the SEC or Big 10 you will find this place below par for a college game day experience . Don't believe OU fans they don't know any better"
10156,Date of experience: August 2016,17-Aug-16,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Home of the: Sooners!,"One of the best college football experiences you will ever come across in the nation.  Period.  Having been to this stadium since the turn of the millennium (early 2000's), I can say that I have seen this stadium improve in parking structure, increase stadium size, structural invigoration, and starting this upcoming season, the stadium is once again being improved on: South End Zone will have additional premium seats for those who want to experience the game from another perspective.  Don't have season tickets nor have I experienced premium seats firsthand yet.  However, I am just as happy being in the regular seating and student seating in the past.  OU football games at the Oklahoma Memorial Stadium is something every Sooner fan (alumni, their family, current OU students, Big 12 school affiliates, etc)  needs to experience firsthand.  The last visit to the stadium was with my young children (boy&girl) to meet Coach Bob Stoops and the team (including Baker Mayfield, Samaje Perine & company where autographs were given)."
10157,Date of experience: September 2015,3-Aug-16,SEC,Oklahoma,2,OU Propaganda at its best,"If you are an OU fan, then this is the place to go, but if you attended any other school, stay away. You will hear bragging about National Championships that the NCAA does not recognize, and encounter fans that  every fan in the Big XII  avoids.   Some of the elderly fans are reasonable, but  this place is not acceptable for the average college football fan.   Kansas State's fan base is much better, and I did not go there.  The seats are poor, unless you are a millionaire, and the fans leave in droves if OU is losing.  They boo their team if they make a bad play, and are the most ignorant fans about football, and sports in general, that I have met in the Big XII, and I have talked to fans from every school.  The atmosphere is akin to a political convention. If you are an OU fan, you will love it, but if you are not, there are many other better places to go, and I have  been in Waco, Stillwater, and Manhattan, Kansas. The surrounding restaurants and sites, however, are pretty good."
10158,Date of experience: October 2015,27-Jul-16,SEC,Oklahoma,5,The good is getting great,Love watching my Sooners in a fantastic atmosphere for many years.

10162,Date of experience: November 2015,15-Jul-16,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Boomer Sooner,"This prestigous stadium is a must see for any die hard football fan.  If you are lucky enough to attend a game you will be blown away by the atmosphere and how much energy the crowd brings when the Sooners take the field, the Pride of Oklahoma never disappoints with their halftime performance either."
10164,Date of experience: October 2015,9-Jul-16,SEC,Oklahoma,5,What can you say...The Home of the Oklahoma Sooners.  Nothing more is needed,A great place.  A great team.  A great state.  I have been going to Memorial Stadium since I was a little kid.  Over 50 years.  It still excites me to go.  Watching the Pride of Oklahoma march out playing Oklahoma.  The National Anthem.  Football.  Gives you chills every time.
10165,Date of experience: October 2015,30-Jun-16,SEC,Oklahoma,5,The best place to watch college football in the entire USA,"Great stadium which is completing some end zone remodel for next year.

10169,Date of experience: November 2015,7-Apr-16,SEC,Oklahoma,5,The Greatest College Football Stadium . . . and Team!,"Of course, I'm prejudiced, being a huge OU fan. The atmosphere here is electric. OU has the best fan base and this place is filled for every home game.  I prefer not to sit with our daughter in the student section, as you end up standing for the entire game. Instead, we buy tickets in the regular sections and sit with her there or meet her and her friends after the games (LOL). If you've never been to an OU football game, you need to go.  And check out the statue garden right outside of it to see the statues of the MANY (hey, I told you that I was a huge OU fan) Heisman trophy winners. Boomer Sooners!"
10170,Date of experience: September 2015,15-Mar-16,SEC,Oklahoma,5,NHS vs NNHS Rivalry,Love going to this game at the beginning off school each year with the kids. It's a great time with the family and so awesome for these teen athletes to get to play on the Sooners field. OU games of course are amazing here. Always improving and making it an even better experience for the fans.
10172,Date of experience: September 2015,29-Feb-16,SEC,Oklahoma,4,Hot as Hell if you get the wrong seats,"Look at the start time and stadium layout, so you're not in the sun during summer games. You will become sunburned, dehydrated, stinky and in a bad mood quickly if just take the cheap seats. If ramps are crowded you may also wait 45 minutes to get into the stadium after waiting 30 minutes to gain entrance to stadium. In a state with no professional football, college football is considered professional. There will only be a next time with a Sooner Suite for this gal ;)"
10173,Date of experience: November 2015,5-Jan-16,SEC,Oklahoma,3,Season football tickets,"I like the football stadium but recently the university has upped donor prices that are attached to season tickets and gradually being raised for the next three years as much as $1,000 per ticket for 2018; end zone not included.  Plus, they have announced all season ticket holders must purchase bowl tickets or lose their season tickets for one year."
10174,Date of experience: December 2015,5-Jan-16,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Is there a better place to watch football in America?,"With the pending completion of renovations later this year (2016), seating and comfort will be greatly enhanced throughout the stadium.  There are plenty of toilets, lots of food, and plenty of Sooner spirit.  Whenever possible, try to get tickets in the west side lounge (well worth it), and avoid tickets in the west side upper, upper deck during early season day games (before 3:00 PM."
10175,Date of experience: January 2016,1-Jan-16,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Boomer Sooner,Home of the Oklahoma Sooners! Great stadium with no bad seats in the Crimson House. Make sure to check out the Sooner Museum inside.
10176,Date of experience: November 2015,30-Dec-15,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Great Place to Enjoy College Football,Oklahoma Memorial Stadium is a great place to enjoy a college football game on an Saturday in the fall.  I have never sat in a poor seat.  The campus is beautiful and the crowd is usually very strong.  The bathrooms definitely need to be updated and you can always expect a lot of walking on your way to the game.  No alcohol is served so it is a great place to take the kids (earmuffs are sometimes needed!).  Be sure to check out Heisman Park located just east of the stadiums main gates where statues have been erected to honor the 5 Heisman trophy winners.
10177,Date of experience: November 2015,7-Dec-15,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Booomer!!!!!,One of the coolest experiences at a classic and historic football venue.  Make sure to walk down onto campus corner and grab a corndog and few beers before the game.  Great college football atmosphere!!!
10178,Date of experience: November 2015,25-Nov-15,SEC,Oklahoma,5,What a special place-Sooner/Boomer Palace,"What a party, OU vs TCU, constant activity during the game, presentations, cheer leaders, band, ads, horse and wagons after each touch down, canon shots-do the Sooners do it right-you bet"
10179,Date of experience: November 2015,12-Nov-15,SEC,Oklahoma,5,"Fun, Fun, Fun Time","Amazing time in and around the stadium.  The pregame festivities were great.  The stadium is located in the middle of the campus, at least that's how it felt.  Walking around the outside was easy and the 2 shops that sold OU clothing and other good items were also easy to access.  The stadium is well marked and easy to move through.  the improvements are going to be awesome and won't add a lot of seats, can't wait.  BOOMER SOONER!!!"
10180,Date of experience: November 2015,11-Nov-15,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Love this stadium!,Go OU! The stadium has great seating and viewing from all around the field. The food options are typical stadium variety. The people are always kind!
10181,Date of experience: October 2015,28-Oct-15,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Fantistic Football Stadium,"Fabulous football stadium for OU fans and visitors.  OU Memorial Stadium has certainly changed over the years, but the fans remain the same - fanatical, friendly OU fans. We've invited friends to attend when their team plays OU in Norman.  Each time, our friends have been amazed by the large stadium, friendly OU fans and the experience.  Renovations over the years have replaced the dusty surface on the east side, expanded the east side and added seating. Now we await the next in a series of ongoing expansions as this already perfect stadium continues to improve with time.  In past years when OU played Colorado, Missouri and Nebraska, fans from these states sat near us or were guests we invited and all had the same reaction.  Even our friends from Richmond, VA, faithful OSU grads, who had never been to a game in Norman, described the game at Oklahoma Memorial Stadium as a near religious experience - close to an event one would envision at the ancient Colosseum.  Certain games have pregame Air Force flyovers or fireworks after touchdowns, but every game has the Pride of Oklahoma band.  West side shaded seats are cooler in August/September.  In October/November, the sun keeps fans warmer on the east side. Everyone football fan should visit this historic stadium for an unforgettable experience. Boomer Sooner!"
10182,Date of experience: October 2015,26-Oct-15,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Boomer Sooner!,I can't wait for the improvements to the stadium to be completed but in the mean time they do a good job trying to be as accommodating as possible for those with special needs.  We truly enjoyed our last visit which was the OU-Texas Tech game.  It was lots of fun as always and lots of good food!It will be great to see the improvements!
10183,Date of experience: October 2015,14-Oct-15,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Yep,"Love this place. We have seats up high by the press box and can still see everything on the field just fine. Would love to have escalators installed so I didn't have to walk up all of those ramps. (A girl can dream, right?)"
10184,Date of experience: October 2015,14-Oct-15,SEC,Oklahoma,5,OU Football is always a great way to spend a Saturday!,"I took my son and his friend to their first game in October.  We watched OU beat WVU.  As a lifelong fan and OU graduate, it was wonderful to see my son get to watch the Sooners play in the stadium.  There is nothing like hearing the crowd cheer and band play while you are at the game.  As a general rule, my son isn't a big fan.  However, at the end of the game, he asked if we could come back for the homecoming game."

10186,Date of experience: October 2015,8-Oct-15,SEC,Oklahoma,4,"Non-game day visit, check out the OU fan shop and bookstore","Most people are probably not going to visit Memorial Stadium on a non-game day. But the OU bookstore is in the stadium and has two complete levels. The upper level is dedicated to OU fan gear and has everything but OU underwear (at least I didn't see any)! We also got to meet one of the OU football players who happened to be in the shop. The downstairs is devoted to books and sale items. A nice place to visit; clean, crisp and not crowded."
10187,Date of experience: October 2015,4-Oct-15,SEC,Oklahoma,3,OU FOOTBALL SEATS,Seats are too close together. There needs to be a little more room to sit and stand comfortably. Too pricey for such crowded surroundings. Let's get this updated OU.
10188,Date of experience: October 2015,3-Oct-15,SEC,Oklahoma,4,Enjoyed the Day,"First trip to Norman to see OU play WV. Went with a buddy of mine that used to play for OU. Really enjoyed the visit. The stadium is huge and very well done. Does not seem to be a bad seat in the house. Food, refreshments, bathroom easy access all around the stadium. Really enjoyed all the statues of all the great OU players and coaches. andcoaches"
10189,Date of experience: October 2015,3-Oct-15,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Oklahoma Memorial Stadium,"Home of the Oklahoma Sooners. It's a great stadium that holds about 85,000 people. They have an enormous TV screen on both ends of the field. Home fans are wonderful and cheer hard. Easy access on the Oklahoma campus. It's important to sit in your own seat because every seat is sold. Went there today and really enjoyed the game against West Virginia. Plenty to eat and drink but maybe a little gouging. A great way to spend a Saturday rooting on the Sooner  football team."
10190,Date of experience: September 2015,3-Oct-15,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Trip to Oklahoma,"A historical stadium, currently being renovated and enlarged.  The center of OU athletics, close to all the campus buildings.  A must see for all college football fans!"
10191,Date of experience: October 2014,30-Sep-15,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Crazy Atmosphere,"OU isn't particularly known for having ""crazy"" crowds. But, their student section is right up there with the best of the crazies.If you're buying tickets ti a game from out of town. Try to get seats in the west side. The Oklahoma sun is brutal when you're on the east side."
10192,Date of experience: September 2015,29-Sep-15,SEC,Oklahoma,5,sooner magic,wonderful place to see an oklahoma sooner football game!! good food inside the stadium. drinks are availabe.
10193,Date of experience: September 2015,27-Sep-15,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Choose Wisely for Comfort and Efficiency,"If you have the opportunity to select seats with seat backs, do it.  If you want to buy water, purchase it at one of the water and soda vendors in the stadium instead of waiting in the long food line.  There are two entrances for many of the ladies' rooms.  If you have the choice, select the side entrance which is much less crowded and more efficient."
10194,Date of experience: September 2015,9-Sep-15,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Oklahoma SPIRIT,"This stadium and university outstanding.  The campus has a wonderful charm and history.  Some building date back to the 1800's.  Walk around the campus and read the history. Going to the game- go to the eastside of the stadium and take a photo opportunity with the Heisman Trophy winners, tour the stadium and see the accomplishments then head outside for tailgating fun!Sooners' really know how to tailgate.  You don't see this many tailgaters at the NFL! The stadium is average size put packed with crimson/creme and spirit.  The roar of the crowd and the band reflects off the surrounding buildings-----WOW WHAT A SOUND! Whether they are winning or loosing- the spirit is something to write about in your journal! There is a fee for parking and of course you must have a ticket to enter stadium."
10195,Date of experience: September 2015,9-Sep-15,SEC,Oklahoma,5,...Boomer ...Sooner,"Never a dull moment.  They really know how to entertain.  It is always more then just a football game it is an experience that involves all the senses, of course it helps if we are winning!"
10196,Date of experience: September 2015,6-Sep-15,SEC,Oklahoma,5,What an Experience,"My family and I attended the first home game for OU this season. We made a trip all the way from Minnesota to catch a Sooners game. The city of Norman and the college are beautiful. The stadium isn't beautiful but there is so much history here! We heard all the horror stories about the traffic, since we drove 12 hours to get here we didn't want to sit in traffic just getting to Norman so we got to the stadium about 4 hours before game time, a bit to early. It was nice to be able to walk around though and experience the stadium along with 80 thousand other fans. Their is a team spirit that is unmatched and not really a bad seat in the house."
10198,Date of experience: August 2015,1-Sep-15,SEC,Oklahoma,4,Hard to believe.,Hard to believe this is all there is for the legend that OU football is.  I have seen bigger college stadiums but never seen more support for a team!This is Barry's world.
10199,Date of experience: August 2015,24-Aug-15,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Love Football games in the stadium!,"Love going to OU games here!  The fans are nice and full of energy.  Service at concessions is great.  Looking forward to our next game. Football games do get crowded, but that's typical for most big college programs.  Love that the stadium is right on campus."
10200,Date of experience: September 2014,5-Aug-15,SEC,Oklahoma,2,Money for nothing,"The first time I attended an OU football game at Owen Field, it was one of the most exciting days of my life.  I had never been in a stadium before, and the sound of the crowd cheering sent delicious chills up my spine.  My seat wasn't comfortable, but I was young and didn't care.  I enjoyed all my subsequent trips there during the Switzer era, like the K-State game in 1986 when I got so sunburned during the 56-10 rout that my companion had to buy me a visor.  Those are memories I will always cherish.  That's why it made me sick when Frank Horton fired Barry Switzer, the best coach in college football, back in 1989, and it's making me even sicker that OU is going to turn our beautiful old stadium into a bowl and ruin it for life-long fans like me.  It was bad enough Boren decided to rename it the Gaylord Family Memorial Stadium--such hogwash!--but this plan will spoil the place for me forever.  I'll never attend another game at the refurbished stadium, which hopefully may never happen if we have another lousy season under $5.5-million-dollar Bob Stoops.  The faculty hasn't had merit raises in years, yet Bob gets yearly raises.  How many millions does one person need?  New, ugly buildings crop up everywhere, and Campus Corner is turning into a strip mall.  I'm about ready to leave this town for good.  Thanks a bunch, Mr. Boren, for ruining a great university, a beautiful town, and a wonderful, historic football tradition."

10205,Date of experience: November 2014,1-Jul-15,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Love this Place,"What a great football stadium to see a game! This place is filled to the brim with tradition.  If you don't mind being packed in with 80,000 plus screaming fans, then this is your place."
10206,Date of experience: October 2014,19-Jun-15,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Sooner Magic,There is nothing like a crisp fall day watching the Oklahoma Sooners. If you are not there on a gameday be sure to check out the Switzer Center and all the trophies.
10207,Date of experience: November 2014,20-May-15,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Football game,"There is no way to experience the true electricity of an Oklahoma University football game unless you are in the stadium.  Campus Corner is at its best on game day.  There is something for everyone on game day. ( kid friendly) Even if you don't have a ticket, there are big screens outside of the stadium where you can watch the game, have a drink n food with rabid Sooner fans and enjoy the game day craziness! FUN!! Have to do it at least once!!!"
10212,Date of experience: September 2014,6-Mar-15,SEC,Oklahoma,4,Nice stadium.,"I surprised my son and took him to the WVU @ OU game in September 2013.  First off, the OU fans were very friendly and invited us to their tailgates...which we accepted.  It's a gorgeous stadium.  My only complaint was that I didn't feel that the bathroom & vending booths were large enough to support a crowd of 85,000+ people.  OU has a great campus and history so it was a fun place to watch a game...despite WVU losing & it was 100+ degrees at a 6 PM kickoff.   We've visited Texas and OU thus far and look forward to checking out other B12 campuses soon."
10213,Date of experience: October 2014,1-Feb-15,SEC,Oklahoma,4,One of the Classics!,"Nice stadium for one of the true standard bearers of college football. As with most stadiums, the bathrooms and vending could use improvement but for the joy of watching the game it is excellent. Plan on walking a ways to park but enjoy the great tailgating scene!"
10214,Date of experience: January 2015,26-Jan-15,SEC,Oklahoma,4,Cool stadium,"It was open, easy to get in the stands and look around. Quite an impressive stadium. Not allowed to walk on the grass though."
10216,Date of experience: November 2014,2-Dec-14,SEC,Oklahoma,5,On six Saturday's...,On six Saturday's each year this is the best place to be in the world. The Sooner's taking the field against all-comers with all the hoopla and festivities of big-time college football...
10217,Date of experience: November 2014,25-Nov-14,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Awesome Experience,"Outstanding venue for a football game.  We visited the Switzer Center the day after the game, neat to see all the Sooner trophies and history.  We saw the OU Pride Band pass through O'Connells Friday night, our middle school daughter asked a cheerleader ""to take a selfie with her"", and we even ran across Coach Stoops who stopped to take a picture with our daughter.  Everyone was friendly and welcoming, great visit."
10218,Date of experience: November 2014,24-Nov-14,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Best football venue in the BIG 12!,"The tradition of OU football cannot be matched in the Big 12!  The atmosphere in the stadium is the best!  The exterior monuments are awesome, with the 5 Heisman statues and the Barry Switzer Center!  We will attend as many games as we can!"
10219,Date of experience: October 2014,19-Nov-14,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Fun time,We drove from California to attend the homecoming game between OU & Kansas. It was the first time attending a college game. We had a blast. Our seats were very high up but the view was good. Can't wait to come back to another game next year.
10221,Date of experience: November 2014,11-Nov-14,SEC,Oklahoma,4,Great Stadium - nice people!,"We enjoyed our visit to the Oklahoma Stadium - the crowd was great and the sightlines are very good in the stands.  We were blessed with a beautiful day, but I noticed they had prominent emergency procedures posted and verbalized during the game. The only issue I saw was that the concession areas were crowded past capacity during the halftime break to the point where it was difficult to navigate to the restrooms. We were rooting for the visiting team, but the Oklahoma fans were very gracious and we would love to come back in a few years!"
10222,Date of experience: November 2014,11-Nov-14,SEC,Oklahoma,4,First time there.,"Attended the Baylor - OSU game, was pretty crowded in the beginning but got nice and roomy midway through the third quarter.  :)"
10223,Date of experience: November 2014,11-Nov-14,SEC,Oklahoma,4,Great Stadium,"Got seats on Stub Hub for a football weekend.  Ended up with seats that had access to the club.  Nice perk and worth the extra $.  Stadium is easy to access, clean, great views (except, I'm sure, from the nosebleed seats) and friendly, fun place to see a game (except when OU gets hammered by Baylor...)"
10225,Date of experience: October 2014,5-Nov-14,SEC,Oklahoma,4,Football stadium,"You can walk around, but you are not allowed on the grass. It seemed like a nice stadium.I went on a weekday when there was not a game happening.No free parking nearby."
10226,Date of experience: October 2014,3-Nov-14,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Sooners Baby,"It's OU football -- what can I say.  Electric atmosphere, packed stadium, football at its best.  Get there early to avoid the crowds and tailgate beforehand."
10227,Date of experience: October 2014,21-Oct-14,SEC,Oklahoma,5,"Good game, good atmosphere","Went to K-State vs. OU game 2014. They won 31-30 good game. Sat in section 9 row 2 seats 3&4.Had cheerleaders right in front of us.On end zone. Bad to see down the sideline, but was a very almost on the field great experience.Awesome experience, great food.We parked at Noble center (free) and took the $3 roundtrip shuttle. A little walk to stadium but got to see some great aspects of the campus. They had a disabled/handicapped bus as well.The bookstore was outside the gates, so once you went in you were stuck in there.Traffic wasn't bad in the center and out."
10228,Date of experience: October 2014,19-Oct-14,SEC,Oklahoma,4,Boomer stadium,"Fun experience to see game in person. Fans are very loyal. As with all stadiums parking is at a premium and traffic backs up coming and going. Food prices are high. Spent about 30 bucks for two cheeseburgers, two cokes, one fry and one popcorn. Seating is bleachers and is crowded. Fun to see game in person despite drawbacks. Pretty campus by stadium."
10229,Date of experience: September 2014,19-Oct-14,SEC,Oklahoma,3,It's a Stadium...,"Despite the beauty of the campus, this is a rather plan and ugly stadium. If you sit on the east side, the sun will be in your eyes for about half of the game and it's incredibly hot. The food and beverages are expensive, but you are not allowed to bring your own in so you'll have to splurge to get water which you will definitely need. If you can pay extra for a backed chair, do it. The bleachers are uncomfortable. It's also very crowded when you try to get in and out of the seating areas."
10231,Date of experience: September 2014,15-Sep-14,SEC,Oklahoma,3,Long lines for the bathrooms and cramped seats,Lines are long going to the bathroom.  Seats are cramped.  Not enough room to sit or to stand without elbowing the person next to you.
10232,Date of experience: November 2013,6-Sep-14,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Great Game Day Atmosphere!,"Going to a home game in Norman is a day long experience!  You start with the tailgate, then the game, then tailgate again.  The town is a true college town and one of the prettiest campuses around.  The crowd really gets into the spirit.  Love it!"

It is not just a game, it is an event and a must-see!"
10243,Date of experience: September 2013,20-Feb-14,SEC,Oklahoma,4,"Opposing fan, liked it","I have traveled to about 10 different college football stadiums.  I must say this was one of the better ones.  Great to see the traditions, and a NICE hosting fanbase."
10245,Date of experience: October 2013,21-Jan-14,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Love watching OUr SOONERS!,"The University Of Oklahoma football program is very popular and the energy is exciting.

10246,Date of experience: October 2013,2-Dec-13,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Oklahoma Memorial Stadium,This is an absolute must if you are a Sooner fan! There is nothing like watching the Sooner in their home stadium and Sooner fans are awesome.
10247,Date of experience: November 2013,25-Nov-13,SEC,Oklahoma,5,The Sooner Experience,"As a season ticket holder I enjoy the entire Game Day experience. From attending Fan Fest, getting our picture taken  by Party Pics (and ordering it online if we like it) before the game, then attending the most exciting 4 hours of my week. OU fans are friendly, the pre-game shows are exciting to watch on the jumbotron, and listening to the Pride play the OU Chant and state song is a game day tradition. There are usually people selling tickets for the game around the stadium but you can also go to the ticket office to see if there are some that have been turned back in by season ticket holders for sale, so those seats are used and occupied by someone who wants to see the game. For example, as a season ticket holder, if I can't attend a game, I can turn them in and they will be sold to someone else.  It's is a great mechanism to let everyone have a chance to see OU play.Memorial Stadium is also a great place to hear and see a concert. I have attended several there and there isn't a bad seat in the house."
10248,Date of experience: October 2013,18-Nov-13,SEC,Oklahoma,5,A Football Game is a Great Experience,"Although I may be biased, attending a football game in Oklahoma Memorial Stadium with 80,000+ fans is one of the great experiences in sports."
10249,Date of experience: October 2013,31-Oct-13,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Not many better than this,"The production that goes into an OU football game is like no other it is something you just have to experience.  They spend great amounts of time, effort and money to get you pumped up for the game with the begining ceremony.  There is no bad seat in the house.  I would suggest you eat before you go as the food is sub par at best."
10250,Date of experience: October 2013,28-Oct-13,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Beautiful Stadium,"If you haven't been to an OU football game, you're definitely missing out on something special.  The stadium, and the grounds surrounding the stadium, are beautiful, and the games are so much fun!  Try to go to a night game if possible."
10251,Date of experience: October 2013,21-Oct-13,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Memorial,"This was very emotional; they have done a wonderful job of a memorial for those lost that day!  Didn't get a chance to go through the Museum, but grounds were aweseome."
10253,Date of experience: September 2013,26-Sep-13,SEC,Oklahoma,5,BOOMER SOONER!!!,"My wife and I went to the game versus the Tulsa Golden Hurricane on a beautiful day for football. For me, the game was like my mom and dad were fighting as I grew up a Sooners fan, but I graduated from Tulsa. You hate for either to lose. However, I had to go with my upbringing and hope that my alma mater would make the game competitive. Like anyplace else, the closer you park, the earlier you should arrive and the more money you will pay. For us, we took the exit off of I-35 onto State Highway 9 East and followed it to Jenkins Avenue. On the NW corner of the intersection, there is Lloyd Noble Arena, and we parked in the parking lot for free. We walked to the stadium (around ?? mile), but you can ride a bus to the stadium for $2. Since the game started at 11 AM, we arrived to park around 8 AM. Another benefit of arriving early is that you can walk around and take in the atmosphere and tradition. Many people congregate at Campus Corner, which is located about 5 blocks to the north of the stadium. We didn??t do this, but I included the information in this review as it is a big part of the game day experience for many people.On the east side of the stadium, on Jenkins Avenue, there is Heisman Park. You can view the larger than life statues of Oklahoma??s five Heisman trophy winners. There are statues of Billy Vessels (1952), Steve Owens (1969), Billy Sims (1978), Jason White (2003) and Sam Bradford (2008). Only Notre Dame, Ohio State and USC have more Heisman Winners than OU. South of Heisman Park, there are statues of Barry Switzer, Chuck Fairbanks and Bennie Owen (the namesake of ??Owen Field??). North of Heisman Park, there is a parking lot with various vendor booths, as well as the Sooner Schooner. You can get your picture taken with Boomer and Sooner. To the south of the stadium, there is a plaza You cannot enter the stadium until 90 minutes before game time (unless you have a club ticket). There is a Bank of Oklahoma ATM on the east side of the inside of the stadium. The holographic OU souvenir cup will cost $5. Most of the other concessions are standard fare, in price and selection, as compared to other stadiums and concert venues. Since you will sit on bleachers, you may wish to rent a stadium seat for $5. New security rules are in place, such that do not allow you to bring your own seat cushion.  A game day program is $5. Unless you are part of the tailgating, I would recommend getting into the stadium around 45 minutes prior to kickoff. You can see the end of warm ups by the players. The Pride of Oklahoma marching band will perform prior to the National Anthem and kickoff. At the end of the National Anthem, you will hear  ??For the land of the free and the home of the SOONERS!??. No disrespect intended ?? fans of the Sooners are red-blooded Americans. Right before kickoff, raise a hand in the air, extend your index finger, and join the tens of thousands of Sooners fans build to a crescendo of ??O?? until the ball is kicked. You are now part of one of the greatest traditions in college sports. BOOMER SOONER!!!TIP: I recommend that you bring a small plastic bag to put your program in, or anything else that you do not want to get wet. If you set things down by where you are sitting, beer or pop will inevitably find their way to your items. This is a good idea for any game, concert, NASCAR race, or other large organized event."
10254,Date of experience: September 2013,16-Sep-13,SEC,Oklahoma,5,"Great game, awesome atmosphere!","Went to my first ever Sooners game and LOVED IT!  The stadium is big, but they fill it up every weekend, and it was awesome being there in person!! Word of advice... don't forget sunscreen... my arms match the Sooners' jerseys now :( But other than that, it was a blast!"
10255,Date of experience: September 2012,3-Aug-13,SEC,Oklahoma,5,"Insane, crazy, loud","It's well understood why OU's crowd is infamous for their patriotism for the Sooner's!  The place is crazy loud, crazy enthusiastic and is sure to make good on it's promise for an exciting ball game.  The food could use some diversification, but, overall a great time."
10256,Date of experience: October 2012,31-Jul-13,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Boomer Sooner!!,If you claim to be a sooner then this is a must go! I can not imagine claiming to be a sooner fan and not going to at least one game! You must experience at least one game in the stadium to recognize that overall football experience and not just the tailgating to get the full experience of the game. Boomer!
10257,Date of experience: November 2012,29-Jul-13,SEC,Oklahoma,5,A must go,Loud and great fans...stupendous football atmosphere.  O.u. Football and coach Stoops are A1.  I like all of the above.  Some people do not like to stand but that is mainly in student sexton.
10259,Date of experience: August 2012,29-Jul-13,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Go Sooners!,"Great place to watch the Oklahoma Sooners play football. The facility is one of the must sees when traveling to Norman! Situated on the picturesque OU campus it houses the Barry Switzer Museum, Santee Lounge, and the OU Bookstore. Stop my and see where the Sooners play and buy some authentic OU Gear while you are there!"
10260,Date of experience: November 2012,29-Jul-13,SEC,Oklahoma,5,OU Football as good as any in the country,"Go early and enjoy all the collegiate football atmosphere. Campus Corner shops and restaurants are excellent. The Pride of Oklahoma Band is in the open for everyone to enjoy, from the warm-up to the pregame concert on Jacob's Lawn and it's parade to the stadium through Campus Corner. The fan base is as friendly as you will find anywhere. They love their team and they are welcoming in every way to visitors. The campus is one of the most beautiful in the country a swell. The games are exciting and the football traditions are everywhere."
10261,Date of experience: December 2012,29-Jul-13,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Oklahoma Football!,Memorial Stadium is a great place to watch football.

10269,Date of experience: November 2012,10-Feb-13,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Home of the Sooners,"One of the best venues for collegiate football in the US.  Donor privileges are fantastic!  Public (if there is such a thing) privileges are better than most stadiums.  One must tour the Barry Switzer Center located under the South Stadium to see one of the Premier Atheletic Football Departments in the US.  Sooner Football history is displayed in its finest.  Coach Merv Johnson gives the best tour of all ..... well, duh, he's been there since the earth has been warm!"
10270,Date of experience: November 2012,30-Jan-13,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Great place to see a College game.,"The Sooner's put on a class act when it comes to hosting a game.  Very welcoming to visiting teams and fans, both inside and out the stadium.  The south end zone has the big screen and stat boards, so if possible when getting tickets find seats that are not in the south end zone, so you can the see the replays and what not."

10274,Date of experience: September 2012,8-Dec-12,SEC,Oklahoma,4,Worth a visit,"Worth a visit especially if you're never been to a large college football stadium. The redone stadium offers all the needed bathrooms, variety of food, and selection of drinks for the large crowds it can hold. It's worth noting that the OU campus is dry and no beer or alcohol is sold within the stadium. The OU campus is also worth a walk through even on a crowded game day."
10275,Date of experience: November 2012,26-Nov-12,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Nice College Stadium for Football,"cool and WINDY. if you are in the upper level, be sure to bring more layers than I did!  saw the Bedlam thing.

10278,Date of experience: October 2012,30-Oct-12,SEC,Oklahoma,4,great game,"Very nice -- but bathroom lines are ridiculous.  They did ""crimson and white"" when I was there striped by section, it was awesome."
10279,Date of experience: October 2012,29-Oct-12,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Great Stadium - First Class Fans,"Despite being called a racist more than once, OU fans are first class.  The stadium is a great venue that reminds me of Texas High School football on a collegiate level.  They take their tailgating very seriously.  Jumbotron and stadium atmosphere were an amazing experience."
10281,Date of experience: December 2011,8-Oct-12,SEC,Oklahoma,4,great place on a Saturday night,Oklahoma football on a Saturday night in the late fall is a true ``religious'' experience. The views are not always as good as home but the feeling of being in the stadium with thousands of others is worth the visit.
10282,Date of experience: October 2012,3-Oct-12,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Boomer...,"For die-hard OU fans it is always a treat to be in the stands! The food is better than most stadiums. Great student-fans too! The walk to the stadium from the trolly stop is through a giant student block party with free food, beer, and lots of new friends. Free parking at Loyd Noble and fast trolly service is extra nice."
10283,Date of experience: November 2011,2-Sep-12,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Historical stadium,It is also known as Owen Field and goes back nearly 100 years.   Has been updated and expanded.  Just a wonderful setting for Sooner football.  Occasional there are other venues such as The Rolling Stones.

10287,Date of experience: August 2012,17-Aug-12,SEC,Oklahoma,2,Get ready to strip,"I used to enjoy going to the football games, but since 9/11/01 the security is intrusive and it is no longer a pleasure.   You are not permitted any comfort items including water.  It seems like a scheme to sell their own seat backs and food.  Let me tickets go after 40 years."
10292,Date of experience: September 2011,18-Jul-12,SEC,Oklahoma,5,#1,Boomer! I really like how loud the crow is at the games except when were having trouble then everyone folds their arms over the bellies and stands there with frowns.  It is still acceptable to cheer and root for your team even if they are struggling.
10294,Date of experience: October 2011,8-Jul-12,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Oklahoma Memorial Stadium,"I have seen major college football at Michigan Stadium, Spartan Stadium of Michigan State, Memorial Stadium in Lincoln, the Cotton Bowl, Oklahoma State, Missouri, and Razorback Stadium in Fayetteville, AR.  Have attended NFL games in Detroit, Kansas City, St. Louis, and Dallas.  There is nothing like being at Oklahoma Memorial Stadium in Norman.  The gameday experience is spectacular.  All games are sold out but you can get tickets all around the stadium from people not attending.  We park, FOR FREE, at Lloyd Noble Center parking lot.  There are plenty of parking spaces. You can ride the shuttle bus roundtrip for a buck or two. Or, you can walk just over a mile.  We try to get to the parking lot at least 2 hours before gametime as minimum. Any tighter than that and we are in a traffic jam.  An hour and half before kickoff, the marching band plays a pregame concert near the North Oval. Then they march through Campus Corner which is an area north of campus with restaurants, bars, and shops.  Tailgating is all around the campus. Plenty of vendors are around the stadium selling food.  Sooner FanFest is free and north of the stadium. Heisman Park, to the east of the stadium, has statues of the Sooner Heisman Trophy winners.At the game, plan to be standing from the time the band enters the stadium to the first timeout during the game; then you will be back on your feet again.  Expect lots of noise from the firing of rifles by the Rufneks and the crowd. A great video board is over the south endzone and a smaller board is over the north."
10295,Date of experience: September 2011,1-Jul-12,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Great Time,Oklahoma Memrial Stadium is so fun to go to.  The stadium is well maintained and the people that work in it do a great job.
10296,Date of experience: November 2011,21-Jun-12,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Season ticket holder,Wow!  This stadium is so much fun!  Sooner football is the best!
10297,Date of experience: November 2011,2-Jun-12,SEC,Oklahoma,4,"well, home of the sooners","as the home of the sooners, it is more of a shrine than a stadium.  more hallowed ground, non-sooners are expected to remove their hats when visiting"
10298,Date of experience: October 2011,1-Jun-12,SEC,Oklahoma,4,An Experience to Remember,"The entire stadium fairly hums with excitement.  There is not a bad seat unless you are unlucky enough to be behind one of the rude fans who refuse to sit down the entire game.  The crowd is energetic and creates an atmosphere of  intense emotion.  Usually the home team wins, so it can be a very uplifting experience.  If you have any trouble walking or climbing, be sure to sit in the lower levels as it is a long walk up to the seats or down to the restroom or concession facilities."
10299,Date of experience: October 2011,29-May-12,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Boomer Sooner,"Admittedly biased because I retired from and live near OU, I can honestly say that there is nothing like Sooner football ... and tailgating on the beautiful campus is a treat!"
10300,Date of experience: November 2011,10-Apr-12,SEC,Oklahoma,5,OU Football,"Lots of fun. Great fans. Park on the street outside the university, its free, but be prepared to walk."
10301,Date of experience: October 2011,1-Apr-12,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Boomer Sooner!,"Nothing like a little Sooner football!  Great fans, lots of food choices, usually a packed house."
10303,Date of experience: September 2011,18-Mar-12,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Love going to OU games!!!,So much fun going to the University of Oklahoma Sooners games!!!!
10309,Date of experience: November 2011,2-Dec-11,SEC,Oklahoma,5,FUN!,Came in from New York for a real Southern football game OU v Texas A&M.  Had great seats on the East side up high.
10310,Date of experience: October 2010,6-Jul-11,SEC,Oklahoma,5,Home of the Sooners,"What an incredible atmosphere. The stadium was packed (86,000+) and loud. Unlike a lot of schools, the stadium is located right in the middle of campus, bricked and surrounded by trees. Tailgating all around and a Sooner Fanfest that was free to attend (kids loved it). There's not really a bad seat in the stadium and the video board on the south end zone is so large, you can really see everything happening without even looking at the field. Even a cool place to visit when the Sooners aren't playing. Catch the Switzer Center (SE corner of stadium) if you're in the area."
10313,Date of experience: November 2019,18-Nov-19,SEC,Mississippi,5,Great stadium,"We went here for the Alabama game this weekend and had a great time. From what I could see there weren??t too many bad seats in the stadium if any. The concessions were much cheaper than other stadiums I have been too. There are definitely cowbells being rung, but it??s not too bad."
10314,Date of experience: September 2019,28-Sep-19,SEC,Mississippi,5,Awesome place for a visiting fan (just bring ear buds),"If your ears survive the ringing of the cowbells, you will enjoy the hospitality and atmosphere of Davis Wade Stadium. As a visiting fan, I found the concession prices EXTREMELY reasonable. $2 for a water, $2 for a hot dog - this is cheaper than most gas stations. Free water provided throughout the concourse to help you stay hydrated in the Mississippi sun. Opposing fans are nice and friendly, it is Mississippi after all. I love the track around the perimeter of the field, it helps you feel up close to the action and really feel the energy of pre and post-game festivities. An awesome place to see a game, win or lose."
10315,Date of experience: September 2019,14-Sep-19,SEC,Mississippi,5,Amazing stadium and staff,Went for the Kstate vs MS State game (go cats). This is such a great place to see a game. Friendly fans and helpful staff makes a great environment for a game. If you get a chance to see a game in Starkville you must go. 5 stars!!!
10316,Date of experience: October 2018,19-Nov-18,SEC,Mississippi,4,Having also been to Vaught-Hemingway...,"...the experiences could hardly have been more different.  TripAdvisor doesn't want me to write about my other experience here, so let's just say I posted a review of it too.We were among State fans a lot before the game, and in a State section of the stadium. To the last person, everyone was friendly or least polite. I would be at 5 stars if not for cowbells!I didn't have preconceptions about these schools before, but now there's only one thing left to say. HAIL STATE!"
10317,Date of experience: October 2022,4-Nov-22,SEC,Mississippi,1,Concession stands suck big time,"I stood in line at the concession stand throughout all of the half time and half of the 3rd quarter. I got to third in line from the counter and the person working just left. Didn??t say a word, just walked off, never came back and no one behind the counter would do anything. I felt really bad for the person who was first in line that had two small kids with them."
10318,Date of experience: November 2021,14-Nov-21,SEC,Mississippi,4,Good game and good food.,The game we attended (vs Texas A&M) was excellent.  The stadium itself does lend itself to some limitations on game day.  The concourses are incredibly narrow and there are all sorts of little stairways all over.  The light show during the game is neat to watch.  The pulled pork sandwiches I had were outstanding.  Ole Miss desperately needs to fix the bus situation that takes you to the satellite parking lots.  The people running the buses were unorganized and the lines were haphazard.
10319,Date of experience: October 2021,24-Oct-21,SEC,Mississippi,3,It??s an ok place to see a game if you??re interested in the teams that are playing,"The game and the show are very good. Even the poor seats have good views of the large screen monitors. The PA system leaves people in some sections of the stadium (like our seats in K) wondering what the announcer just said. The crowd responds well to the calls for noise and cheers. And the crowd puts on a good show. Prior to the game the best show in town is in The Grove. If you are being hosted at a tailgating tent with catered food and drinks you will have a great time. Otherwise, just a walk through the area will give you a wonderful sightseeing experience. As far as the stadium itself, it offers very poor refreshment facilities. It is normal to have hundreds of people in lines at every one of them, blocking traffic and leading to an unnecessarily long time away from the game. The refreshment stands are poorly organized. It is common for you to work your way all the way up to the front just to find you are in the wrong line. Or even as bad, the items you want aren??t offered there so you have to start all over again at another stand. They do offer a digital pre order and pick up service that saves a bit of time but not much. The best advice is to eat well before going to a game so that you never have to leave your seat except for the restrooms which are also disorganized, small and have long lines at times."
10321,Date of experience: November 2019,29-Nov-19,SEC,Mississippi,4,SEC Football Cathedral,"While fairly small at 64,000, the stadium is one of 14 SEC football stadiums where you will see the best college football.  I have been to 10 of the 14 and they are all great stadiums.  V-H is easy to enter and walk around and get food or use the restrooms.  The size and configuration mean nearly all seats are good.  If you are an SEC fan, get to the Grove and then get to the Vaught."
10322,Date of experience: November 2019,17-Nov-19,SEC,Mississippi,4,Good place to watch a game,Nice stadium and seats are good. Close to field. Parking is challenging if you cannot walk too far. You have to park off campus. It??s about a 12 minute walk.
10323,Date of experience: September 2019,23-Sep-19,SEC,Mississippi,3,Good place to watch a game,"Vaught-Hemingway stadium is a good SEC venue.  The sight lines are good from just about anywhere.  It's a pretty standard stadium, good video board, and very easy access in and out."
10324,Date of experience: September 2019,13-Sep-19,SEC,Mississippi,5,Recalling when Eli Manning beat Alabama,"It's been a long time since my wife and I visited Oxford, Mississippi. It was in 1992. We were traveling to Vicksburg, Port Gibson, Natchez and Oxford, as we are doing this year. But I had arranged through a friend to get two tickets to the Alabama/Ole Miss football game while we were in Oxford. Our tickets were in the Alabama section in the upper balcony of Vaught-Hemingway Stadium on the Ole Miss campus. Eli Manning was a sophomore at the time. His father, Ole Miss legend Archie Manning, was sitting in the stands. As luck would have it, it rained from start to finish. But Eli passed for two touchdowns in the last few minutes as Ole Miss rallied to win. My wife and I were soaked. At the time, the stadium, which was opened in 1915, was undergoing major renovations. Today, inamed after former Ole Miss coach Johnny Vaught and Judge William Hemingway, who was a professor of law and chairman of the university's committee on athletics, it is the largest stadium in Mississippi with a capacity of 64,038. It features a new press box, lights, AstroPlay artificial turf surface, luxury boxes, a high definition Daktronics video board that is the eighth largest scoreboard in college football and 150,000-square-foot indoor practice facility and locker room that is linked to the stadium via an underground tunnel."
10325,Date of experience: October 2018,4-Sep-19,SEC,Mississippi,5,Fall football,Great stadium to watch the rebels play football.  TAILGATIING is always gret in the grove and they are adding new menu items this  year that will only enhance the experience
10326,Date of experience: October 2018,15-Jan-19,SEC,Mississippi,5,Hoddy Toddy,Wonderful game day experience!  Spend time in The Grove; attend the football game and wander to the square for after game celebration win or like se!
10327,Date of experience: November 2018,30-Dec-18,SEC,Mississippi,4,Great place,"Great place to see a game, easy to access. All the seats offer great views of the game. Restrooms and concessions need to be updated."
10328,Date of experience: November 2018,13-Nov-18,SEC,Mississippi,4,"Nice, updated stadium","Open airy ramps improve accessibility in this mid-sized stadium. The bottomless sodas are convenient, and speed the concession lines by allowing you to refill your drinks at separate stations. Southern favorites like pimento cheese & crackers were a unique option too. Although we didn??t try it, the mobile ordering system is a great option to minimize line time too."
10329,Date of experience: October 2018,7-Nov-18,SEC,Mississippi,5,Auburn Game,We are Auburn fans and attended the Auburn/Ole Miss game a few weeks ago.  I have to say the Ole Miss family welcomed us with open arms.  Concessions were convenient as were restrooms.  Loved Oxford and will definitely go back.
10330,Date of experience: November 2018,5-Nov-18,SEC,Mississippi,5,Carolina vs Ole Miss.......SEVEN SOUTH TAILGATING,"Our tailgating group of friends and family have been planning this trip for a year and were looking forward to it since we had never been to Oxford.  We have tailgated all over the SEC and most of the ACC and have to say that this was by far our FAVORITE place.  Every Ole Miss fan that we encountered was gracious and welcoming.  Our Friday night walk in to downtown Oxford for dinner and drinks was fun and memorable.  Tailgating on Saturday in the Grove on the Walk of Champions was an experience we will never forget.  If you want to truly enjoy the atmosphere of Ole Miss and the Grove, spend the $ and contact Kyle Thornton at SEVEN SOUTH TAILGATING.  Kyle and his team were absolutely wonderful to work with and set us up in the perfect spot to enjoy all the pre and post game revelry.  You will not be disappointed at all in working with Kyle.  If you want to treat yourself even more, get your tailgate catered from Ole Miss Tailgating and they will deliver your food right to your tailgate spot.  MANY THANKS to Kyle and his team at SEVEN SOUTH TAILGATING and Samantha at Ole Miss Tailgating for making this such a special trip.  Our only regret is that we had to leave and the Gamecocks won't be headed back to Oxford for another ten years........that is unless we decide to go back again just for the experience."
10331,Date of experience: November 2018,4-Nov-18,SEC,Mississippi,5,USC vs Ole Miss,This was by far the best away game experience we have had as far as concessions. $8 bottomless sodas and very reasonably priced food. People behind the counter above S section friendly as can be. Bathrooms also clean and not long lines. All home fans we met were great and overall wonderful experience.
10332,Date of experience: November 2018,4-Nov-18,SEC,Mississippi,5,Awesome game day experience!,Great stadium (especially the South Club) and usually great fan experience especially when coupled with a visit to The Grove for the ultimate tail-gating event!
10333,Date of experience: October 2018,23-Oct-18,SEC,Mississippi,3,Average SEC Stadium,"Best thing was leg room in between rows. Kudos to Ole Miss for this.  There are essentially 3 levels to access your seats, so you may do some zigzagging to get there. Below SEC average in game atmosphere.  Lack of concession options at higher levels. Bottomless drinks were great!"
10334,Date of experience: October 2018,22-Oct-18,SEC,Mississippi,3,"Small stadium, dangerous ramps to the seats","Not allowed to bring an unopened bottle of water like other stadiums will allow. They ran out of Chick-Fil-A and other chicken sandwiches at half time.  Very disappointing. IF you don't eat beef or pork, eat before you go! Very small bathrooms. It is a nice little stadium but the ramp up to the seats was extremely steep. I was nervous for the older folks making their way up and down."
10335,Date of experience: September 2018,13-Oct-18,SEC,Mississippi,4,"Long walk to a small stadium, but friendly people","We were here for the first time for the Bama game and we parked offsite took the bus and seemed to walk forever to the stadium.  Bathroom lines were super long when we walked in before the game and seemed to stay that way throughout the game.I do not think prices were any higher than other stadiums.  It is a shame that they do not allow you to bring water in as Texas A&M does.There was nothing that was Special about here, but we will come back in two years for the Bama game regardless of the stadium, we will just be prepared for the VERY long walk to the stadium."
10336,Date of experience: September 2018,25-Sep-18,SEC,Mississippi,3,Small Stadium,"The Stadium is small and really not a bad seat. They are doing construction around the stadium so you may have to walk over or around gravel mounds to get to the gate. The signage is not very clear and parking is non-existent. The campus is nice and the tailgating is crazy. Been to LSU, UT, Vandy, & MS State, sorry, Ole Miss fans were the rudest. Be prepared for lots of 4 letter words."
10337,Date of experience: September 2018,19-Sep-18,SEC,Mississippi,3,Football,First time her for the Alabama game roll tide it was ok they no how to tailgate but the only problem I had couldn't find a park then when I didn't had to walk about 3 miles they had everything block off or parking was to high but overall good game
10338,Date of experience: September 2018,17-Sep-18,SEC,Mississippi,5,Roll Tide game was great but parking is scarce,Wear your walking shoes parking was crazy we parked at Oxford bicycle club and took a cab which ended up being $10 per person and we still had to walk quite a bit about mile and a half . We even had a handicap placard but all of the staff was temp service and clueless as to where we could park even at the stadium they didn??t know where the seating was so temp workers was a downside . Also bring cash everything??s cash. There was a really great tail gate party and it was very clean . We took Uber from the game and I prescheduled our pickup it was only $11 for all 4 of us
10339,Date of experience: September 2018,16-Sep-18,SEC,Mississippi,4,Nice stadium,Nice stadium. Seems to be well kept and maintained. Love the endless refills on the fountain drinks for $8. Short walk from lot 7. Exiting campus was really quick and easy from lot 7.

10341,Date of experience: October 2017,22-Aug-18,SEC,Mississippi,5,Enjoy the game!,Such a great atmosphere and love cheering for Ole Miss - Hotty Toddy!!  Great views from anywhere and a great tradition.
10342,Date of experience: September 2017,9-Jun-18,SEC,Mississippi,5,Great venue for Football,"Ole Miss Alum, so I am biased, but I can say there is no bad seat in this stadium. Its close enough to downtown to park close the square (world class food) and walk to games. Has good in stadium eats, and the bottomless soda is a must during ballgames."
10343,Date of experience: November 2017,9-Apr-18,SEC,Mississippi,1,not worth the effort,"Dirty, hard to get around, seats are uncomfortable, concessions ridiculous, rest rooms impossible, regularly run out of water, no ventilation."
10345,Date of experience: October 2017,4-Jan-18,SEC,Mississippi,5,Great Game Atmosphere!,"We went for the 2017 LSU v. Ole Miss game, and had a blast! This stadium is TINY in comparison to other SEC stadiums, but it was nice. Everything seems new or well-kept. We were actually quiet close to the field and the price was great!We visited a lot of stadiums this football season, and this one was very fun. The Grove was great to walk through--almost overwhelming in the number of people crammed in there! Highly recommend visiting, no matter who you root for!"
10346,Date of experience: November 2017,6-Dec-17,SEC,Mississippi,3,An older stadium at a historic college,"We attended the Ole Miss - Texas A&M football game here. The construction around the stadium made it hard to get in to and we had to walk way around several buildings to get in. The stadium is very basic and plain but everyone was friendly and helpful. Be sure to bring warm clothes and something warm to insulate the cold, aluminum bench."
10347,Date of experience: November 2017,18-Nov-17,SEC,Mississippi,4,1st down...Oooole Miss!,"great place to watch my first SEC game.  the ""Grove"" wasn't too busy two hours before game time, but from my understanding this isn't a traditional place to tailgate.  fans in the grove essentially go and set up their tents to watch the, not necessarily just a tailgating location.the campus is beautiful."
10348,Date of experience: October 2017,7-Nov-17,SEC,Mississippi,5,Gets better every year!,"We make at least one game a year and the consistent upgrades are really starting to payoff.  Streamlined access, improved appearance, enhanced food options and ordering all make for a great game day experience."
10349,Date of experience: October 2017,30-Oct-17,SEC,Mississippi,5,Compliments from the Visitors,"We attended the Arkansas v. Ole Miss game.  We feel your pain!  What a tough loss but the Ole Miss fans around Hogs Section K were classy and friendly.  We loved the bottomless Coke products in the concession stands and of course the ??tailgating?? in The Grove must be seen to be believed.  If you go to a game, be aware that the SEC requires see-through clutches and tote bags this year??check the school websites for the rules of what can and can??t come in with you."
10350,Date of experience: October 2017,28-Oct-17,SEC,Mississippi,5,Great,"Always great fun in the grove, stadium is great, great food, first class folks at ole miss always friendly"

10352,Date of experience: October 2017,23-Oct-17,SEC,Mississippi,5,LSU - Ole Miss game,"Best fans in the SEC. Upgrades to the stadium, facilities, and adjacent structures make the game day experience a pleasure. Music a little loud, PA system not so much, hard to head announcers."
10353,Date of experience: October 2017,16-Oct-17,SEC,Mississippi,5,Fun SEC stadium with great views,"Ole Miss stadium is clean and provides up-close sight lines for reasonable ticket prices. The BBQ nachos are delish, and for $8, you get a jumbo cup for unlimited soda refills. The fans were a little bit testy with each other (seating rights) and with refs (disputed calls), but outside the stadium, folks who were tail-gating in the Grove seemed friendly with each other. Go early so you can stroll among the awnings and see this spectacle with chandeliers, table decorations, flatscreens, and tons of food. Keep an eye for the zebra tent, and you might be invited in for a snack.Park at the bank at the corner of University and Lamar for $20.  Three-quarter mile walk and easy out.  Take a hat or sunglasses."
10354,Date of experience: September 2017,11-Oct-17,SEC,Mississippi,4,Great Venue,"What a great stadium! The pre-game in The Grove is so much fun, too. Make sure to rent the seat backs - it makes sitting much more comfortable and they're reasonably priced."
10355,Date of experience: September 2017,28-Sep-17,SEC,Mississippi,4,A Great Stadium That Has Been Recently Enlarged and Modernized,"My wife and I did not attend a game in the stadium as we were there on an away-game weekend. However, we did drive by the stadium and case out the exterior. It is a classic and beautifully built football facility, with a large press box area, although it is a bit smaller than some. The stadium can now seat around 65,000 people though that still makes it smaller than those at LSU and Texas A&M.The stadium blends in well with the buildings around it and is a tremendous asset to the campus."
10356,Date of experience: September 2017,10-Sep-17,SEC,Mississippi,5,Awesome place to watch Ole Miss football!,We have seats on 50 yard line & 4th row right behind Ole Miss bench!  Love being able to see what's going off the field!  Had Chic Fa La concessions!  Original chicken sandwich was so fresh!  Like that you can refill water bottle for free!  My favorite place to watch a football game!
10357,Date of experience: September 2017,3-Sep-17,SEC,Mississippi,5,"Really great football stadium with a lot of crazy, high energy fans.","My family and I got to take my daughter-in-law to an Ole MIss game, she being a rabid Ole Miss fan.  I was greatly impressed with the stadium and the university grounds.  The fans were great.  Once again we were lucky enough to get some tickets off of Vettix.org.  So if you are a vet check it out for tickets.  If you aren't, please consider vettix.org whenever you have extra tickets you won't use.  We old war horses appreciate it.  The stadium seating was actually much better than I had anticipated having been to too many other stadiums in my time (read that as old).   As for the fare, we didn't try much, but bottled water was $3 (cheaper than a lot of places) and a bottomless soda was $8.  Burger basket I think was $12.  For those going, parking is sold out to the season ticket holders, but you can park at the mall and catch the shuttle.  Other than that plan on spending about $20 to park elsewhere, catch one of the shuttles and walk a lot.  For those with disabilities there are quite a number of large golf cart type shuttles all around."

10361,Date of experience: October 2016,14-Feb-17,SEC,Mississippi,5,See how we do it in Rebel Country!,"The stadium is as once electric, intimate, and full of emotion.  Add in a rival such as LSU or Alabama and what you have is the recipe for the ultimate college football experience in the country.  The seating forms a complete bowl in a more compact than most of the behemoth structures seen at other universities.  The dramatic effect is that the sound is kept inside much better.  A full crowd, a rival game, and a nail-biting outcome can be louder than most people can imagine.Luxury seating can be had on three sides of the structure with plans to have the entire stadium ringed across the top with luxury boxes.  There is a field level luxury seating in the south end zone that allows guests to feel the ground shake and smell the sweat!Food of all kinds can be had on the main concourse.  Corey's BarBQ Nachos is a crowd favorite.  If you like to have a little nip during the game, conceal it well.  There are searches of pockets and bags upon entry.  No alcohol sold anywhere on campus.  Come by and see us anytime.  Section O  Row 22  Seats 30-38."
10362,Date of experience: November 2016,18-Jan-17,SEC,Mississippi,5,Great view no matter where your seats are,"The stadium is very nice and the workers were great.  My only compliant would be that they ran out of food at the concession stand at halftime.  Great atmosphere, but we prepared to walk and pay anywhere from $20 to $100 to park."

This stadium is OLD and needs a good "" Freshen Up "" .. the restrooms were antiquated and there were very few options for snacks and refreshments .. The Ole Miss Rebels are an excellent SEC Football Program and their fans should deserve a better Game Day experience .. I have been visiting this stadium my whole Life and I am sure I will return again ... Even though a facelift is sorely needed on this storied old stadium .. Oxford Rocks ..."
10364,Date of experience: September 2016,4-Dec-16,SEC,Mississippi,5,Utterly amazing,"I went to my first Ole Miss game a few months ago and was blown away.  I'm not from Mississippi, so I was stunned at how much patriotism they have, the school spirit that is everywhere, and what a production a home game is!  It's like Cirque du Soleil meets football.  Seriously mind-blowing.  The stadium is fantastic and has vendors everywhere."
10365,Date of experience: November 2016,28-Nov-16,SEC,Mississippi,4,First time impression so not fully vetted,"I can definitely see why the tailgate experience at The Grove at Ole Miss is highly regarded as being one of the best. I cannot comment about the south end zone relative to viewing or concessions as our seats were towards the north end. There seemed to be a good selection for the concessions and prices consistent with other similar venues. However, Ole Miss definitely needs to add more men's restrooms!"
10366,Date of experience: November 2016,28-Nov-16,SEC,Mississippi,5,Hotty Toddy!,"The best place to watch the Ole Miss Rebels win!! Locking the Vault, screaming Hotty Toddy, red pom poms, etc. One of my favorite places on earth."
10367,Date of experience: November 2016,17-Nov-16,SEC,Mississippi,5,Hotty Toddy Football??,Thoroughly enjoyed the game & complex. Shuttle provided for handicapped throughout campus. Many Ramps vs stairs. Great grub selection. Bonus was the rental of seat backs that attach to the benches....best $10 spent!!
10368,Date of experience: September 2016,8-Nov-16,SEC,Mississippi,5,"At Ole Miss, football Saturdays begin at the Grove","Things have changed a lot since the last time my wife and I visited Vaught-Hemingway Stadium in Oxford, Mississippi. The first time, on October 13, 2001, we saw Eli Manning throw a touchdown pass with 56 seconds to play, rallying Ole Miss from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter to stun Alabama 27-24. It rained most of the day and we were soaking wet. On top of that, we had obtained tickets through a friend, who had arranged to get them from an Alabama women's basketball coach. So we sat in the Alabama section in the upper balcony. A football Saturday in Oxford is like New Year's Eve on Times Square. Hundreds of alumni dress for the occasion and tailgate in the Grove, the tree-lined park in front of the Lyceum, Ole Miss' historic administration building, and a short walk from Vaught-Hemingway Stadium. Interestingly, a year later, the stadium underwent a massive renovation that boosted its attendance to 60,000. I still recall when we arrived in Oxford the day before the game, we walked to the stadium and I entered one of the main gates, then walked across the field and up a ramp to locate our seats. Then I retraced my steps and left the stadium. And I didn't see a soul the entire time. Curiously, on game day, we were searched before entering the stadium. Construction began in 1915 but prior to the early 1990s, Ole Miss played many of its big rivalry games at Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium in Jackson, 170 miles south of the Old Miss campus. In 2002, the south end zone bleachers were replaced with a rounded bowl, adding luxury boxes and covered club seating in an upper deck. These renovations expanded seating capacity by nearly 10,000. Additional seats were added in 2016, bringing the total capacity to 64,038. Other additions were new stadium lights, a new sound system, FieldTurf, a 150,000-square-foot indoor practice facility and locker room facility and a new high definition, $8 million Daktronics video board in the north end zone, the eighth largest scoreboard in NCAA college football, measuring 48 feet by 84 feet. Vaught-Hemingway isn't as big as Alabama's Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa or Tennessee's Neyland Stadium in Knoxville. But they don't have the Grove."
10369,Date of experience: October 2016,31-Oct-16,SEC,Mississippi,5,"Great stadium, better tailgating","The stadium is easy to navigate with a decent selection of food items. Good legroom. The tailgating was great - if you love college football and all that goes with it, you must see this one."
10370,Date of experience: September 2016,6-Oct-16,SEC,Mississippi,3,Average stadium but above average staff,Very friendly staff in an average stadium. The seats are metal benches. The one thing that was above average was the lemonade stands that had sweet tea and lemonade. Can you say Arnold Palmer?
10371,Date of experience: September 2016,24-Sep-16,SEC,Mississippi,5,Great visit!,While the results were not what we hoped for the stadium and the Ole Miss fans were awesome! Met some great people and each made us feel welcomed!
10372,Date of experience: September 2016,20-Sep-16,SEC,Mississippi,3,"Long Time College Football Fan, First Time at Vaught-Hemingway","While it was exciting to be at the Alabama/Ole Miss game, and certainly one could never compare the two school's stadiums, it was nice to be in a smaller setter and enjoy college football in an intimate setting.  The fans and Ole Miss community were polite and good sports and tailgating on ""The Grove"" is not to be missed.  I was disappointed with the tightness of the seating, we literally could not sit in our seats as the surrounding people were all encroaching.  Also very disappointed at the long concession lines, 35 minutes in line for a bottle of water, only to find they were out of water.  When I suggested they let everyone in line know that before they wait, the answer was, ""I'm too busy to let anyone know."" Oh well, definitely room for improvement, but a great town and school, nonetheless."
10373,Date of experience: August 2016,13-Aug-16,SEC,Mississippi,5,Lock the gate/Let's go pick a fight,Visiting Vaught-Hemingway should be on every football fans list of stadiums to see. New expansion will be ready for the 2016 Football Season.
10374,Date of experience: November 2015,8-Aug-16,SEC,Mississippi,5,My ALL-TIME FAVORITE place to watch a game!,"I'm an OU Sooners fan, and I attended the United States Air Force Academy.  In other words, I didn't attend school at Ole Miss and am completely unbiased in this review.  This is simply a fantastic place to watch a game.  The game experience in and of itself if GREAT...  The Rebel Nachos from the concession is GREAT... And the pre- and post-game tailgating is the best from across the country.  LOVE IT!!!"
10375,Date of experience: August 2015,7-Jul-16,SEC,Mississippi,4,Classic Football Stadium,This is a classic old football stadium that's named after the greatest head coach that Ole Miss football ever had.
10376,Date of experience: October 2015,10-Jun-16,SEC,Mississippi,4,Good place to see a game.,People very nice and a good place to see a game but the concessions stand needs more food and more of them. Easy to get into the staduim and overall great time.
10377,Date of experience: November 2015,20-May-16,SEC,Mississippi,5,Fun,"Rich in tradition of SEC football.  Fun place to go to games, unless you're an Alabama fan.  Better learn Hotty Toddy!"
10378,Date of experience: November 2015,17-May-16,SEC,Mississippi,5,Home of the Amazing Rebels!,"Vaught-Hemingway is a great stadium. With the renovations going on now, it will take on an even better feel to it. Parking is an issue on game days, but go early, park and go to The Grove! Then, after the game go back to The Grove and wait until the crowd dissipates as traffic is an issue as well. It's the BEST tailgating and all-around football experience in America!"
10379,Date of experience: September 2015,14-Apr-16,SEC,Mississippi,5,Nothing like an Ole Miss game!!!,"After tailgating in The Grove, take in the game. Great experience feeling the electricity of the stadium! A must do! The Rebels have an unsurpassed level of school spirit & pride!"
10380,Date of experience: October 2015,17-Feb-16,SEC,Mississippi,4,Great atmosphere,"4 hours of watching a game where the rules meant nothing to me did not detract from a great experience. Red or blue colours to be worn and Pom poms  to be waved and songs to  be sung.  Dancers, bands, gymnasts, singers flood the field and are just the prelud to he football itself."
10381,Date of experience: November 2015,13-Jan-16,SEC,Mississippi,5,LSU vs.Ole Miss,"If you want the real feel of an SEC football rivalry, any game played at historic Vaught-Hemingway Stadium on the campus of Ole Miss will provide you with all the excitement and fanfare you could ever possibly want."
10382,Date of experience: November 2015,10-Dec-15,SEC,Mississippi,5,Awesome Ole Miss Football - nothing else to say!,We LOVE V-H stadium. The improvements over the last couple of years have been great and they have already started the north end zone addition.  Ready for the 2016 season to get here!
10383,Date of experience: November 2015,10-Nov-15,SEC,Mississippi,5,The Greatest Experience in College Football,"If you love college football, you must make a trip to Ole Miss to visit the Grove on a football weekend. Words cannot describe the experience of partying there. As they say at Ole Miss, ""we don't win every game but we've never lost a party""."
10384,Date of experience: November 2015,7-Nov-15,SEC,Mississippi,5,A Fun Day,"My first trip to Oxford and I had a blast.  Started the day tailgating in the Grove, then saw an exciting game.  A smaller stadium, by and electrifying atmosphere."
10385,Date of experience: October 2015,31-Oct-15,SEC,Mississippi,5,My favorite place to watch college football!,Has been enlarged over the years!  Added more concessions this year!  Love the new parking garage!  Best place to watch college football!
10386,Date of experience: October 2015,27-Oct-15,SEC,Mississippi,5,"Bucket list experience, Checked","Highly recommend heading down to Ole Miss and The Grove for a gameday experience unlike any other. The tailgate can't be compared, it's amazing. The people are so nice and Ole Miss fans go ALL OUT.Stadium has new luxury suites above the student/band section end zone and they are beautiful. Fully stocked and great food. Highly recommend if you can find the extremely coveted tickets."
10387,Date of experience: October 2015,25-Oct-15,SEC,Mississippi,5,Electric Football Game,"Came to see the Rebels play football for the first time, what a great stadium.  Beautiful campus and fields.  Band was really good and fans were excited and loud.  Must walk through the Grove and see how the rebels tailgate.  They take it to a whole new level.   Stadium was clean, appears older, but well maintained."
10388,Date of experience: September 2022,7-Sep-22,SEC,South Carolina,2,Not prepared for the crowds,The woman sitting next to me at the game had to go to FOUR different concessions because they kept running out of food.  Very poor preparation.
10389,Date of experience: August 2022,14-Aug-22,SEC,South Carolina,5,Gamecocks Football YES!,"This is a great experience attending the Gamecock Swarm - the atmosphere is electric!  Great fans, growing team and awesome environment."
10391,Date of experience: November 2019,9-Mar-20,SEC,South Carolina,5,Join the best college football fans and watch a game,Williams-Brice is an underrated but excellent place to catch a college football game amongst the rabid USC fans.  Relatively easy to get to with plenty of parking.  Great football environment and friendly fans.
10392,Date of experience: September 2019,17-Sep-19,SEC,South Carolina,4,Easy to Get Around,Arrived about 40 minutes prior to kick-off. Bag check line moved quickly-clear bags only. Be aware that pom-poms are not allowed. Easy to find our seat section. Usher showed us to our seats. Brought clear water bottles that we could fill with ice cold water from a large cooler positioned on the concourse near our seats. Seating is very tight. Stood for the majority of 3 quarters of football.
10393,Date of experience: September 2019,14-Sep-19,SEC,South Carolina,5,Game Day,We enjoyed our outing today to the USC/Alabama game. It was a very hot day!!! Visiting side was directly in sun!!! Seats were way too close together and narrow in the upper deck. Bathrooms were so cute with Gamecock carvings on the stall doors. Lots of people!!!
10396,Date of experience: December 2018,10-Mar-19,SEC,South Carolina,5,Greatest entrance to college sports!,"If for no other reason, one must attend a game just to experience 2001 as the team enters the field. And, ""the Zone"" is luxury at it's finest."
10397,Date of experience: October 2018,12-Feb-19,SEC,South Carolina,5,Let's go Gamecocks!!,"I am a graduate of University of South Carolina.  Williams Brice is a safe secure place to host a football game or music event.  It holds 80k people.  On a Saturday in the fall, you will hear the roar of the fans of the Gamecocks cheering on their team.   Most people who attend games tail gate and its a blast.  There is ample parking but bring cash to park as almost all spaces require fees.  One word of caution, the stadium does not allow any bags that are not see through.  These heavy duty clear plastic bags are available for purchase at the store under the stadium.  Come on down to Cola town to support the Gamecocks."
10398,Date of experience: October 2018,15-Jan-19,SEC,South Carolina,4,"Great atmosphere, though could use some updating.",If you are a Gamecocks fan then you have to attend a home game at least once! The atmosphere is incredible and definitely one of the best college football experiences in the country! The only thing that keeps me from giving a 5 star review is the fact that the restroom facilities need to be updated.
10399,Date of experience: October 2018,14-Dec-18,SEC,South Carolina,5,Get ready for some football!,"Bottom line -- this stadium becomes the third largest city in South Carolina on game day, and flat out the loudest place in the entire state.  If you haven't done ""Sand Storm"" in Willy B, put it on your bucket list!"
10400,Date of experience: November 2018,11-Dec-18,SEC,South Carolina,5,Gamecocks vs Chattanooga,"It is our daughter's first year of college, and she is in the Mighty Sound of the Southeast, so we came down to see a game.We purchased a parking pass in Gamecock park and had tickets in the upper deck on the home side.  It was very easy to navigate around the area and the employees were very helpful in finding our spot.  The stadium itself is quite impressive.  It is a mile or so away from campus and is quite a sight to behold when you drive into the area.  The seats were very comfortable, and every seat seemed to have a decent view of the field.  Getting to the upper deck was a breeze as the stadium has wide spiral walkways and is well marked.  There are plenty of restrooms, as well as concession areas.  Security does a great job of keeping an eye on everything.It was a great environment in which to see a game, and in which to introduce our youngest daughter to the excitement of SEC football!  We look forward to seeing the Clemson game there next year.  It's time to take it up a notch!!  Go, Cocks!!"
10401,Date of experience: October 2018,10-Dec-18,SEC,South Carolina,4,Great Stadium,I was in town for the Tennessee v South Carolina game. The stadium was very modern compared to some of the SEC stadiums. The bathrooms in the upper deck were lacking with long lines for the men??s rooms. I wished for a better experience on the field but was glad to visit another stadium in the SEC conference.
10402,Date of experience: December 2018,3-Dec-18,SEC,South Carolina,5,"great stadium, easy parking and access","have attended several games here and always enjoy the atmosphere.  Stadium is nice and clean, seating is great.  Easy access to the gates.  Enjoyed visiting the fan shop on site."
10403,Date of experience: October 2018,30-Oct-18,SEC,South Carolina,5,SEC Visit,"If you want to go to a fun SEC stadium, you have to fit this one in on the list! We traveled from Knoxville for the Tennessee/South Carolina game. The atmosphere was really fun to be in. Had a few Gamecock fans around us and all of them were very polite. Good game, bad outcome, but had a great time!"
10404,Date of experience: September 2018,10-Sep-18,SEC,South Carolina,5,AWESOME venue to see sports!!!,Wow...what an incredible place to see a football game!  The USC crowd really gets in to the spirit of things especially with the opening ceremony for the game!  It was mesmerizing! Can't wait to go back!
10405,Date of experience: September 2018,8-Sep-18,SEC,South Carolina,5,The Best Crowd...Ever,"I am bias. I know. As a foreign student back in the early 90??s, never forgot the experience. Now, i come back for some games and it is better every year. If you are closed to Columbia and they have a game on a Saturday; DO NOT MISSED IT."
10406,Date of experience: October 2017,6-Sep-18,SEC,South Carolina,2,"Great memories, terrible fans","I've been going to home games since 1981. My father brought me as a newborn in October of that year. I remember dressing up as Todd Ellis for Halloween. We had season tickets until 2007, and I saw many a game from the student section when I was an undergrad. Then we moved away and other things in life happened, but Williams-Brice and the fairgrounds have always held a special place for me. It's one of the places that ties me back to SC. For the last several years I've tried to make it to at least 1 home game with my Dad and every time we go it's just been more trouble than it's worth. The SC fan base has gone from fun and happy go lucky to distinctly mean and tacky. I always believed we were better and classier than Clemson as fans, but I don't see any difference anymore. Last year for example a woman in her 30s and her SO were sitting behind myself and my then pregnant wife (I was trying to imbue the kid w/ some pre-natal garnet and black). She was ridiculously drunk and so was her SO. She started kicking our seats with her feet and then started kicking us in the back. We asked her to stop and she told us to f* off, that she could put her feet where ever she wanted. It was the Mizzou game so it was packed. There was nowhere else for us to go so I told her that there was no reason to be rude and that was met by her SO telling us that she said f* off and if we wanted to make an issue of it he'd gladly engage in fisticuffs with us. We walked off and got the usher who did absolutely nothing despite the lady having recently vomited in the stands. So we threw our arms up and left while they shouted insults at us. The Cocks were losing anyway and we left feeling like our fans weren't the people they used to be. I got my second degree at NCSU so perhaps we'll give Carter Finley a chance, it's closer to us anyway."
10407,Date of experience: October 2017,28-Aug-18,SEC,South Carolina,5,Great Stadium!,Great stadium! Well taken care of and good choices from the vendors. Enjoyed a football game with all their amazing fans!
10408,Date of experience: December 2017,8-Aug-18,SEC,South Carolina,4,Large well kept stadium,Lots of school spirit. They have railroad cabooses nearby for game parties and parking lots they turn into party lots. See a game if you are there at right time.
10410,Date of experience: October 2017,3-Jul-18,SEC,South Carolina,5,Great view from any seat!,"Attended a football game on a beautiful day, easy free parking and shuttle over to the stadium.  The stadium is nice and clean, with many places to buy food and drinks."
10411,Date of experience: September 2017,7-Jun-18,SEC,South Carolina,5,Something to Experience,"There is nothing quite like Southeastern Conference football and Williams-Brice Stadium provides the perfect setting to enjoy the experience.  Join 85,000 garnet and black clad supporters cheer on the Carolina Gamecocks has they host the top teams in the country... from the beginning notes of ""2001"" that signal the beginning of the game until the final crows celebrating another Carolina victory,  enjoy one of the best college football atmospheres."
10413,Date of experience: November 2017,22-Apr-18,SEC,South Carolina,4,Nice stadium but concessions need upgrading as do upper deck access avenues.,"The stadium is nice but upper decks need easier/better access, such as escalators like the Zone has. Also concession areas, especially upper deck are so crowded during games it makes access ridiculous."
10414,Date of experience: September 2017,7-Apr-18,SEC,South Carolina,5,Best SEC Stadium Experience,I've been here over 100 times.  Awesome tailgating close to stadium and amazing people.  Big games are more electric but I really enjoy every second here.  Great people and great times!
10415,Date of experience: November 2017,19-Nov-17,SEC,South Carolina,5,Great place to watch the Gamecocks!,Williams-Brice is home to the South Carolina Gamecocks. It??s a great stadium to watch a game. The concessions are good and they move you thru pretty quick. Stop in for a game and have a wonderful time.
10416,Date of experience: October 2017,31-Oct-17,SEC,South Carolina,4,"Not bad, but not awesome","Recently purchased some tickets to see the South Carolina vs Arkansas game. It was a good game, but the crowd never got behind the home team. Atmosphere wasn't there for me, even though the home team blew Arkansas out of the water."
10417,Date of experience: October 2017,25-Oct-17,SEC,South Carolina,5,Vastly superior to my expectation,"I attended the recent South Carolina/Arkansas game and had a terrific time. This stadium is not on campus or adjacent so I always dismissed it as bland cement and mostly clunky and awkward. My dad and I drove past Columbia many times on I-26 and never considered visiting the stadium, although we did stop and see the nearby military museum.How wrong I was. This venue features a tremendous atmosphere. I had no idea they had so many accompanying features, like the train box cars. The indoor facility is within walking distance and flanked by energetic tailgating. There are further additions underway in that area. And there are actual public bathrooms available in that area, and not merely port a pits like virtually every other football venue. I am a Canes fan and we were playing at Florida State simultaneous to the South Carolina/Arkansas game. So I wore my Canes gear head to toe. The Gamecock fans handled it well. One guy joked that I was obviously confused. At least 10 South Carolina fans came up to me and told me they were rooting for Miami against Florida State. While South Carolina was winning in rout fashion several of their fans sweated out the end of the Canes game alongside me in the stands, and offered congratulations as Miami pulled it out in the final seconds. When I mentioned I was an alumnus of the other USC, the one in Los Angeles, the fans didn't hold that against me either.I have to concede I had no idea who Darius Rucker was. The name meant nothing to me but as I was walking around the stadium a half hour prior to game time there was a commotion and people taking pictures of a guy walking toward us, who was surrounded by fans. That guy tugged on my Canes shirt and said, ""They better win today."" I had a brief typical fan exchange with him, with both of us emphasizing it was about time for the Canes to end the 7 game losing streak in the series. The gathering had to briefly stop during our chat. It turned out I had an exchange with Darius Rucker. That's great but I still don't know anything about him, other than a quick Google. He seemed like a good guy.The waving of the white towels in the stands brought me back to the Dolphins heyday in the early '70s when I was a kid in the Orange Bowl. We waved white hankies --- 80,000 strong. That tradition never should have stopped. I'm glad the Gamecocks have a similar version.Prior to heading for the game I read horror stories about $30-40 parking. No chance I was shelling out that much. Fortunately I set my GPS to an exit on Bluff and a guy waving a $5 parking sign was right there. Yes indeed. I can see the stadium in the distance so who cares about the walk? On exit I got to I-77 within a quarter mile and zipped away. That in itself it so preferable to parking lot misery at Joe Robbie Stadium, or whatever they now call that monstrosity in Miami."
10418,Date of experience: October 2017,20-Oct-17,SEC,South Carolina,4,Gamecocks,"The stadium and all its features are top of the line. It is very nice and you can see it in the skyline. It also sits next to the State fairgrounds and is near campus. Having such a nice place to call home, one would think the football team would be top of the line too. Not so much."
10419,Date of experience: October 2017,11-Oct-17,SEC,South Carolina,5,Loudest in the South,Beautiful stadium where the Gamecocks of the University of South Carolina play is an awesome venue.  You must check this out!!!
10420,Date of experience: October 2017,9-Oct-17,SEC,South Carolina,5,Bigger than Life SEC football,Well USC has got more spirit than some NFL teams. Every fan decked out in attire.  The shuttle buses from campus are well organized and all the workers and volunteers around the stadium know their job and are more than glad to help you.  My only suggestion if their is ever a reno- put some shading for upper deck cause you fry up there.
10421,Date of experience: September 2017,9-Oct-17,SEC,South Carolina,5,Awesome Stadium,"Watching the Gamecocks run out of the tunnel to 2001 and then playing Sandstorm to get the crowd going is awesome.  80,000 waving white rags in the air is an incredible sight.  The fans are great and Cocky is the best."
10422,Date of experience: September 2017,24-Sep-17,SEC,South Carolina,5,Football game,Has seen a exciting football game of the gamecocks over there!

Definitely a family friendly place."
10425,Date of experience: September 2017,19-Sep-17,SEC,South Carolina,4,nice stadium,Average football stadium and prices. Set up a lot differently than the stadium we are from (univ of ky). Not a lot of signage telling where to go or what to do. But nice staffing.
10426,Date of experience: October 2016,20-Jul-17,SEC,South Carolina,1,CRAPPY  STADIUM WORSE FANS,"Never seen so many ill mannered, hateful piece of crap drunk trash at any sporting event!!!This is why SEC should never allow beer or liquor sales at collegiate games. Gamecocks are a bunch of drunk stupid chickens!! Ina piece of trash stadium; I will never be there again."
10428,Date of experience: October 2016,2-May-17,SEC,South Carolina,5,A good facility to spend a a fall afternoon watching a Gamecock football game,This is a nice SEC football facility with good parking in the SC State Fair parking lot or  other small areas with various price points.  Come early so you can  get a decent parking space.  Purses and any other bags must be made of clear plastic.  Bathrooms could have more toilets.
10430,Date of experience: November 2016,30-Mar-17,SEC,South Carolina,5,Great College Football Experience!,"This is a great stadium to watch College Football. The fans are passionate and there are tons of parking/tailgate options. There are multiple traffic routes so traffic isn't terrible considering 90,000+ are driving in/out. If in Columbia on a Saturday make sure to experience a game!"
10432,Date of experience: October 2016,25-Jan-17,SEC,South Carolina,4,Can't Beat the Gamecock Spirit,Great stadium venue.  SEC provides many of the best games in college football and you can't beat the spirit expelled in that stadium.  Maybe it has something to do with the massive tailgate event that precedes the games!
10433,Date of experience: November 2016,21-Jan-17,SEC,South Carolina,4,Typical Deep South College Football Experience,Great place to experience deep South college football.  Extensive tailgaiting with regional barbeque and chicken all around.  Friendly fans and alumni.  Stadium is very convenient to Columbia Hamilton - Owens Airport.  If you are lucky enough to have access to one of the near stadium condos; just makes the experience even more enjoyable
10434,Date of experience: October 2016,1-Jan-17,SEC,South Carolina,5,One of the best stadiums in the country,"I am a lifelong Gamecock fan but after having visited other stadiums throughout the country and within the United States and especially the SEC, this is one of the better ones.Not really a bad seat in the stadium, the entrance to the theme from 2001 is one of the top five entrances in all of college football. The fans are mostly polite except fro the occasional drunk fan(they got drunk before coming in as no alcohol is allowed in the stadium). The bathrooms are clean, and the concession stands sometimes are a little long, but they have something for anyone. The prices are a bit high but in line with other stadiums in and around the country"
10435,Date of experience: November 2016,18-Dec-16,SEC,South Carolina,5,The place to be in the fall!,"Whether you're a Gamecock fan or just want to experience college football, you will enjoy your time at Williams-Brice - a neat stadium with good infrastructure in the heart of Columbia SC."
10436,Date of experience: November 2016,24-Nov-16,SEC,South Carolina,5,Where to sit,"Stadium holds approximately 80,000 fans. For South Carolina fans, I would always pick west lower seats. You get away from being directly in the sun. Also club seats in west side are nice and covered. If you are lucky enough to get ""Zone"" seats, they are located in the end zone but you get an elevator ride and a banquet hall."
10437,Date of experience: November 2016,24-Nov-16,SEC,South Carolina,4,Good Stadium for Carolina Football,"Attended a USC Football game recently and everything about the stadium is great. Easy to find our seats, customer service is great and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience."
10438,Date of experience: October 2016,14-Nov-16,SEC,South Carolina,5,Huge place...,We went to the Texas A&M game. Very clean grounds and fun tailgating as well as the game.Inside bathrooms to concessions are clean and well staffed.
10439,Date of experience: November 2016,6-Nov-16,SEC,South Carolina,4,Birthday trip,"My daughter and her husband took me to the Carolina vs Missouri football game. The energy and noise generated is amazing. I was in the end zone and could see well even to the opposite end zone. Plus the giant screen lets you see action from many angles.Like all stadiums there are lines for concessions and restrooms, but it is an experience. It is worth the trip."
10440,Date of experience: November 2016,1-Nov-16,SEC,South Carolina,2,WENT TO FOOTBALL GAME FOR South Carolina,"They spent much money on the outside of this Stadium and it is pretty on the outside. Cabooses are neat and cute,The inside is like a dungeon; primitive and uncomfortable. Didn't spend a dime in there, and then want to rent you stadium seating for $8 a seat. I've seen better high school fields. NOT worth the price of admission if you have to sit at all. Had to have the police come through the section twice to stop drunks from pushing on people. They still came back, their seats were ""too high up"" and the home team side is better. Better than what? We came in on the far side the entire venue inside is crappy!!***What really surprised me though about a Southern team was their cheering while a player was down on the field?!?!? Southern Charm USC style, on multiple occasions they ran cheers while players from both sides were flat on their backs! Everywhere else I've been they are quite and respectful and cheer when they get the players up! So much for Southern Carolina charm, take their cheap imitation of the TERRIBLE TOWELS and go wash their cars or dogs with them. Won't go back there even if two miles up the road. Ill mannered people ""TRASH""."
10441,Date of experience: October 2016,28-Oct-16,SEC,South Carolina,5,Nothing Better,The beautiful design of this stadium is only the start.  Gamecock Park just adds to the feel and excitement as the home team arrives and walks through the park. Once inside the vibe gets you off your feet and the large crowds follow the lead of the student section and cheer for the best team in the best conference.  I shall keep going back as long as possible.
10442,Date of experience: September 2016,26-Oct-16,SEC,South Carolina,5,Home of the Gamecocks,"By far, the nicest football stadium in the Carolinas.  Williams Brice and the surrounding area has undergone tremendous improvements over the last few years, and is a great place to watch college football."
10443,Date of experience: October 2016,23-Oct-16,SEC,South Carolina,4,Great Crowd,"I've visited college football stadiums across the country, and the crowd at South Carolina is as good as it gets.  We enjoyed watching the band warm up, the team walk in, and visiting with people on the Cockaboose Railroad.  Everywhere we went, people went out of their way to be friendly.  Very cool.  I especially enjoyed the band's rendition of the Star Trek theme from recent movies.  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the chicken noises played over the PA system throughout the game!"
10444,Date of experience: September 2016,17-Oct-16,SEC,South Carolina,5,Great place,I had the pleasure of going to the Texas a&m game recently and it was a wonderful experience. I highly recommend visiting the lettermen's lounge if you have the opportunity. You get to relax in an exclusive and nostalgic environment and the meals served before the games are of better quality than standard stadium fare. The game itself was really fun even if the ending was a bit disappointing. Not a bad seat in the house.
10445,Date of experience: October 2016,3-Oct-16,SEC,South Carolina,5,Tailgaiting is at least half the fun,"Williams-Brice Stadium is a wonderful place to watch college football.  Tailgating is at least half of the fun, however, and the tailgating facilities at Williams-Brice are among the best anywhere. It??s always a pleasure to show them to out-of-town guests like we did this past weekend when we attended the Aggies game. Over the past 44 years I??ve personally experienced just about every tailgating option there is at W-B except the Cockabooses (invitations gladly accepted!).  We most recently tailgated in a condo on the top floor of The Spur. This offered many creature comforts and a wonderful panoramic view of the stadium and vicinity, but tailgating in the parking lots remains my top choice for conviviality and excitement."
10446,Date of experience: September 2016,19-Sep-16,SEC,South Carolina,5,Great Place to Watch the Gamecocks Play!,"Although there are a number of uses for ""Willie B"" its major purpose in life is to host home games of the South Carolina Gamecocks.  There are no posts, etc., to block anyone's view of the game and the video board gives a good view of replays.  I would like a wider variety of food vendors but all of the basics are there as well as a number of smaller vendors who have appeared in recent years.  The plaza around the stadium has been remodeled, trees have been added and parking for cars has been eliminated.  It is now a very pleasant pedestrian plaza.  The ramps to the upper decks are easier than stairs, in my opinion, and there are elevators if you are handicapped or a Half Scholarship donor or above.  Come see a game and enjoy a Gamecock Saturday."
10447,Date of experience: September 2016,19-Sep-16,SEC,South Carolina,5,Carolina Football,"I have been attending USC games since I was a little kid. Be sure to get in your seats early so you can get the full effect from one of college footballs best entrances. The University has done a fantastic job doing upgrades to the stadium to match the dedicated fan base. From painting parts of the stadium, rebuilding a fantastic scoreboard, upgrading parking/tailgating, to the newest surrounding walking area around the stadium. Williams-Brice Stadium has made itself one of the prestiges stadiums in the country. This is Carolina Football and Home of the Gamecocks! Spurs Up!!"
10448,Date of experience: September 2016,17-Sep-16,SEC,South Carolina,5,What a great group of paramedics!,"Minutes before the football game started I realized I was feeling ill from the heat, and sought out first aid assistance.  The entire crew was excellent.  They efficiently assessed me and provided me the care I needed.  While I rested and cooled off I watched them skillfully handle a parade of others, some over heated as I was, one with a possible cardiac situation, and several students who had apparently celebrated a little too much before the game.  It was crazy in that first aide room, but those folks never looked frazzled, and frequently checked with each of us even though patients soon overflowed into the corridor.  My hat is off to these Angels, and the one who left ..."
10449,Date of experience: November 2015,12-Sep-16,SEC,South Carolina,5,Come here to see the SEC in action!,"Williams Brice Stadium holds over 80,000 fans and it's amazing because the fans here are incredibly supportive of the Gamecocks. There have been several renovations to the area around the stadium over the last several years. Last year, the entries around the stadium were converted from an asphalt jungle into the Springs Brooks Plaza. This area not only gives a great first impression to fans and first time visitors, but this project also fixed accessibility within the stadium. It used to be difficult to get from one side of the stadium to the other and that is no longer a problem. The Gamecock Park was created several years ago on the land previously occupied by the State Farmers Market. This is the nicest tailgate area and is located across the street from the stadium. It also encompasses the Gamecock Walk so fans can cheer on the team as they walk from the buses into the lockerroom prior to kickoff. The legendary Cockabooses are still located behind the stadium and are premium tailgate area. A string of 22 connected cabooses, they are beautifully refurbished in Gamecock colors and decor. Overall, Williams-Brice Stadium is one of the top 15 stadiums in the country in terms of both amenities and atmosphere. Go Gamecocks!"
10450,Date of experience: August 2015,28-Jul-16,SEC,South Carolina,3,Only if you like football,Are you a University of South Carolina fan or fan of football? This would be the only reason to visit. The stadium is nice with no bad views but parking can be time consuming and frustrating. Plan out where you want to park before you go to make you life a bit easier.
10452,Date of experience: October 2015,30-May-16,SEC,South Carolina,5,Great Venue and Very Well Kept,"This is a very nice stadium with a great atmosphere.  There is a lot of tradition in South Carolina and football is definitely one of them.  The Gamecocks are sure to never disappoint and give a great game as well.  The food here is good, the environment is great, everything is definitely top class here at the University of South Carolina."
10453,Date of experience: September 2015,12-May-16,SEC,South Carolina,5,Home of the Gamecocks and a great college football game atmosphere,"We enjoyed the opportunity to visit Williams-Brice Stadium as our UCF Knights visited the University of South Carolina Gamecocks in late September 2015. This was a great SEC football stadium that is full of very passionate fans and lots of great game day traditions. This is a big time stadium - capacity is over 80,000. Being a fan for the visiting team, the continuous rooster crowing that is blared over the PA can get on your nerves very quickly - but that's what is great about college football. There were plenty of concession options and the staff and fans were friendly - which isn't always the case for a visiting fan at other NCAA stadiums. Game day here is the real deal and if you have the chance to root your team on against the Gamecocks or if you go just to take in a SC game, you'll enjoy visiting this fantastic football stadium."
10454,Date of experience: October 2015,4-May-16,SEC,South Carolina,4,One of the best college football venues.,"College football. Home of the South Carolina University Gamecocks. If you haven't been to a SEC Division football game, this stadium would be one of the better choices.Impressive structure and grounds worth a visit or at least a drive by. No problem parking and walking around the stadium and the surrounding grounds any day that a football is not being played."
10455,Date of experience: September 2015,26-Apr-16,SEC,South Carolina,5,TRADITION !!!,The William Brice Stadium is part of University of South Carolina and holds all of it's sports activities.  There is an excitement of just entering the gates.  It is an excellent stadium and is the home of the USC Gamecocks!!  The atmosphere is parallel to none even before you get inside this LARGE stadium !  AMAZING !!
10456,Date of experience: October 2015,5-Apr-16,SEC,South Carolina,5,Go Gamecocks!,"Home of South Carolina football. Great atmosphere. Study the stadium map before your first trip so finding your seat will be easier. Arrive 30 minutes early to see and hear 2001, the best entrance in College football."

10460,Date of experience: November 2015,29-Jan-16,SEC,South Carolina,5,Only the best,Have been a regular attendee at Gamecock football games for nearly 70 years and there is no place finer in the USA.
10461,Date of experience: November 2015,19-Jan-16,SEC,South Carolina,3,Not what I expected,As much $ as this school draws in with their football fans I was expecting the stadium to be much nicer.  The restrooms seemed like an afterthought since the walls didn't go up to the ceiling so I could hear everything going on in the mens restroom.  They were only separated by a wall of blocks and there was no one cleaning the restrooms so they were on the dirty side.  When we went to the canteen the workers took the tops/lids off and said that fans aren't allowed to have them because people throw them on the field.  Really?  That's the first stadium I've been to where fans behave that way.  I'm just trying to figure out where the hundreds of millions of dollars go because they certainly don't go for the upkeep of the stadium.  Oh and we had to park about a mile or two away and walk since there isn't much reasonable parking within a short distance.  Another first for a football stadium that I've visited.  Glad it was a daytime game and not night as I would have been terrified to walk in the area where we had to park if it were night...
10462,Date of experience: November 2015,14-Jan-16,SEC,South Carolina,5,Great Game Day Experience,Although Im a Gator both of my daughters are attending or grads from USC so it is a regular visit from Florida.  USC fans now how to do it.  Great Facilities and a great Stadium for family fun.  If your a College football fan this is a must.  Parking on the North side of the Stadium is the best but get there early.  Go Gators...

Needless to say, the locals TRULY love their Gamecocks!!! Come early to avoid heavy traffic and park away from the stadium to take advantage of better parking rates."
10464,Date of experience: November 2015,1-Dec-15,SEC,South Carolina,4,Great Atmosphere,"I always wonder when a collegiate stadium is going to decide to go 100% chairback like the NFL.......I enjoyed my time tailgating and watching the game. Concessions were on par with everyone else and maybe a little better than some. I mention seating because it is a little tight for anyone with long legs are maybe weighing over 130lbs. No knee room with upgraded cushion backs so I dont recommend them at all. other than that, its always good to catch a game here...."
10465,Date of experience: November 2015,1-Dec-15,SEC,South Carolina,5,Awesome stadium!,What a wonderful facility.  The area around the stadium has undergone a lot of work. It is very clean and nice accommodations.
10466,Date of experience: September 2015,26-Nov-15,SEC,South Carolina,5,amazing experience,"This was my first college football game, the stadium was so nice and clean and easy to navigate even for its size."
10467,Date of experience: November 2015,24-Nov-15,SEC,South Carolina,5,My favorite stadium,"It was already one of my favorite stadiums together with Maracana in Rio. Now, after the renovation it is even better. You arrive outside the stadium and you see the new entrance facilities, gardens, trees, the divisions of the areas are much bigger, lots of signs, way more open, and safe. The organization also added a nice Carolina gift shop and everybody can buy t-shirts, gifts or spend time inside the place when its cold or too hot. Its a ways better presentation and looks awesome. Go cocks, go Carolina!"
10468,Date of experience: November 2015,16-Nov-15,SEC,South Carolina,4,"Good stadium, aging infrastructure","Had a great time, good seating and stadium did not feel cramped.  People were very friendly.  My wife went down at halftime for food and after waiting in line for 45 minutes found they were out of food.  The food stations are staffed by volunteer groups who make money by staffing the stands.  I had gone down to find my wife as she had not returned.  We had to start walking the separate food stands and everyone was out of food.  They all claimed they had called for food resupply and management ""did not care"".  Finally found the last slice of pizza at one stand who affirmed what we had already heard from others, no food and no more on the way.  Nice stadium, but eat early and don't count on getting anything in the stadium."
10469,Date of experience: November 2015,15-Nov-15,SEC,South Carolina,4,very nice satdium,"This is a great stadium to see a game.  The traffic in and out can be a headache, but there are plenty of police to direct you.  Expect to pay for parking and have a moderate walk to the stadium.  The seating is nice, there are no obstructed views.  There is a huge scoreboard with a video screen that shows replays.  Tons of restrooms on every level, and all were clean and well-maintained.  Great place to see a game on a sunny, southern afternoon."
10470,Date of experience: September 2015,11-Nov-15,SEC,South Carolina,5,Gamecock football and more!,All the renovations and upgrades have just made the stadium an even better place to watch the amazing Gamecock football games - too bad every game can't be a home game!

10473,Date of experience: October 2014,24-Sep-15,SEC,South Carolina,5,This is how you're supposed to watch a football game,"Went to a football game and it was an amazing experience.  We walked about 1/2 mile from our daughter's town house so didn't experience the parking, but it looked VERY well organized. The stadium was clean and the vendors were all over the place. You will never have to wait long for one to come by.  This place jams with the huge crowd they can pack into this stadium and the half-time show was amazing.  It helps that USC has a great football team, making the experience all that much more enjoyable."
10474,Date of experience: September 2015,16-Sep-15,SEC,South Carolina,5,UK vs USC,Beautiful facility....ultra clean and very accessible. Jumbo-tron was first class. Seats were large enough to provide comfort to full sized adults. Rest rooms were ample and catering was outstanding. Great place for a football game.
10475,Date of experience: September 2015,16-Sep-15,SEC,South Carolina,5,One of the Best Football Stadiums,"One of the biggest football stadiums in the country also has one of the most electrifying atmospheres on game day.

10476,Date of experience: September 2015,15-Sep-15,SEC,South Carolina,4,USC Football Stadium is Loud and Proud!,"Williams-Brice Stadium is the home of the University of South Carolina Gamecocks football team in Columbia, SC. The stadium has recently undergone major renovations, and it is impressive.  The stadium features room for 85,000 football fans, several suites and a HUGE Jumbotron at the north end. It is loudest stadium I've ever visited - even louder than LSU's famed Death Valley. A night game is a unique college football experience. the plaza renovations are impressive as are the ""Caboose Tailgate Suites"" where big donors party before the game.The interior of the stadium is modern and clean, however, the underbelly where the old stadium sits is not so clean and features antiquated restroom facilities for the men (you've been forewarned). This includes sections 15-20. I sat in Section 17 with the visiting fans from Kentucky.Parking is willey-nilley. I advise using Parkwhiz to score a reserved spot for $22. We parked at State Media Publishing - a short distance from the stadium and a great space for tailgating. Don't be in a hurry to leave because traffic flow is horrible. We sat in the parking lot for more than an hour.The fans are cordial, the hospitality is Southern and the experience is awesome! It is definitely a bucket list candidate for any US college football fan. I'll definitely be back!"
10477,Date of experience: September 2015,15-Sep-15,SEC,South Carolina,5,An atmosphere like no other...,"If you have never been to an SEC school stadium, you need to put this one on your bucket list. Come for a big rival or game - the place is electric."
10479,Date of experience: September 2015,15-Sep-15,SEC,South Carolina,4,"Great seats, fun crowd.","Enjoyed opening game here versus Kentucky and sat 8 rows up near the 20 yard line. For $100 each per ticket we had great seats (with comfy chair cushions). Note they don't serve beer here as it is a college stadium. Just a reminder, we forgot about that rule!"
10480,Date of experience: September 2015,14-Sep-15,SEC,South Carolina,5,SEC Loss at Home,"Ok first time to Williams Brice Stadium was this past weekend when South Carolina hosted the University of Kentucky in SEC play for their home openner of the season. The Gamecocks lost the game but I still had a good time. Before the game they dedicated the new statue to a hiesman trophy legend and Gamecock Great. As expected before the game on the field was a good warm up with lots of bands and music to get the crowd pumped up. Stadium was laid out in a good manner where everything was easy to find. One problem I had was on the walk up to one of the upper levels they have a ladies rest room on one floor and the mens on another which is kind of annoying. Also the seats are really tight and clse together , so if they were crowded like they were your quit litterally on top on one another. Not use to a professional sporting event without alcohol sales but i guess it has to do with being on a college campus and a university sport so it kind of makes sense even though 70% of the crowd was getting drunk on alcohol they snuck into the stands anyway. Parking was annoying as all get up though. I went with my father in law who is old and can't really walk far but we still had to park about a mile away in some family's backyard for $10. Took 15 minutes to walk to the stadium and another to walk back to the car at night. Took another 45 minutes to get out of the area with all the roads down town closed and made one way traffic. Really horrible road clsures and parking job on everyside. You would think that places like this would have parking garages or atleast make parking more of a priority and have more handicap parking available. Instead we have to pay a family to park in their back yard which to me seems crazy, especially since when we walked up i had to have counted about 200 empty spots in side the stadium barking area where people were playing horseshoes or just standing around. I get tailgating is part of the game but parking needs to be more important. Pissed me off to see people getting drunk in handicap parking spots in the stadium area just because they were tailgating. Wasted space."
10481,Date of experience: November 2014,10-Sep-15,SEC,South Carolina,4,A Little Bit of Winter Down South,"Typical large SEC stadium with good sight lines.  We sat in the upper deck at froze due to temps in the 40's and chilling winds.  Half the crowd was gone by half time.  Southerns aren't used to these conditions.  Great game, UT won in overtime 45-42, but not many fans around at the end to see it."
10482,Date of experience: October 2014,10-Sep-15,SEC,South Carolina,5,Home of the Gamecocks,As an alumni this place is amazing. I look forward to coming here every year. I love what they have done to make this place better and more exciting. I am so ready to go to the new MyCarolina alumni center. Nothing like sandstormin' it out and getting the bleachers to sway. :)
10483,Date of experience: November 2014,31-Aug-15,SEC,South Carolina,1,OK for some,"This is a huge beautiful stadium but it messes up traffic all over Columbia and the selfish people at USC are forcing businesses to move so they can get more parking space.

The electricity in the stadium on game day is incredible. Parking can be difficult if you don't have a reserved spot, but you will find one. Their could always be more bathrooms but that's the case in any stadium. The seating size is better than most stadiums and that's a big plus."

10492,Date of experience: October 2014,6-Jul-15,SEC,South Carolina,2,Don't understand the fuss,"This stadium is a concrete eyesore in the middle of a warehouse district. We paid $20 to park and tailgate next to railroad tracks, loading docks, and barbed wire fencing. There are some very sketchy people hanging around these general pay-parking lots at night games. The atmosphere is great if you're a USC fan, I guess. I don't get the Cocky in a Cage thing? Wasn't impressed, but then again I'm not a USC fan. I feel that it would have been better closer to campus. I have seen some improvements going on since I work in Columbia. The Gamecock Park (I think that is what its called) green space is a nice improvement for this facility."

The stadium was impressive, we enjoyed the seat that we ended up with from a season ticket holder. The game was intense just like last year. I do find it odd that the stadium is so far from campus. I wanted to explore the campus but because it's not located there, we didn't get a chance to see it, which is unfortunate. However, I will likely go to a game here again in the future.

It was hot in those stands, but I had a great time. The stadium's bathrooms were cleaner than I thought they'd be and the variety of foods to eat was pretty good. By the way, we won!"
10506,Date of experience: September 2014,5-Oct-14,SEC,South Carolina,3,A Unique Experience,"I was there for the USC parents weekend football game. I am from the North, and that being said it was like nothing I have ever seen before. The energy was electrifying, as white towels were swirled when the song ""Sandstorm "" was played. What brought my review and my experience down were the police. They were downright nasty, and seemed to enjoy intimidating both the students and the adults."

10508,Date of experience: September 2014,30-Sep-14,SEC,South Carolina,3,Great football game,"It was a lot of fun seeing such a large stadium college football game.  my only complaint, and I feel a big one, is that it is not handicapped or limited mobility friendly.  Which makes all the difference in the world. They could, and should do better."

10510,Date of experience: September 2014,28-Sep-14,SEC,South Carolina,5,Great time,We had a wonderful time at football game. There was enough security to feel safe and plenty of staff for help.
10511,Date of experience: October 2013,25-Sep-14,SEC,South Carolina,5,Awesome sporting experience!,"Williams-Brice is one of the most underrated stadiums in college football. It can be hot for an afternoon game, but still a great place for a game. The atmosphere is amplified beyond belief for a night game. I would recommend a game for anyone."
10512,Date of experience: September 2014,21-Sep-14,SEC,South Carolina,3,"Concessions weak, decent venue for viewing",We visited the stadium for a recent SEC football clash and found the stadium to be lacking in several particulars. The seating is set up without enough room for people to pass by to their seats without crushing toes or standing. The concessions are poorly spaced and open area lacking. The seating allows reasonable viewing but overall compared with other stadiums we have visited it was lacking greatly. Perhaps some remodeling and attention to this details would improve the gameday experience.
10513,Date of experience: September 2014,20-Sep-14,SEC,South Carolina,5,Wedding rehersal dinner,"Unbelievable atmosphere for this function, catered by Blue Marlin Catering (excellent food and service).

The gamecocks were very pleasant ... however I got tickets in sec 19 A3.. you cant see the players or the game ..you are literally on the field.. So I watched the whole game on the giant TV .. ..."
10516,Date of experience: September 2014,14-Sep-14,SEC,South Carolina,5,Unbelievable,Wonderful experience! Clean restrooms! Cannot get that experience from watching football on TV! Food staff and Event staff were very friendly despite having to wait on thousands of people!
10517,Date of experience: August 2014,11-Sep-14,SEC,South Carolina,3,Aggies Fan,"We went to the game on 8/28/2014. The Gamecock students tried to ruin the Aggie's traditional Yell Practice, thankfully their own police escorted them away. Once the Aggies won they changed their tune and many of the same students who showed up to try and ruin our night before offered congratulations on the game."
10518,Date of experience: August 2014,5-Sep-14,SEC,South Carolina,4,Great Football Venue,"Just attended my first football game at William Brice Stadium. The stadium is beautiful with lots of excitement going on.  S.C  Fans were not very friendly.  all other SEc schools have gone out of their way to welcome the opposing team, not so much here.  But the stadium is great, the vendors and the security were all helpful and extremely nice.  The biggest problem is with the traffic flow when leaving the fairgrounds.  It took us about two hours to go very few miles."
10519,Date of experience: August 2014,2-Sep-14,SEC,South Carolina,5,"""Home of the Gamecocks""","One of my favorite football stadiums, featuring the South Carolina Gamecocks and some of the greatest football fans in the country. Easy access, fantastic tailgating opportunities, and as always Southern charm and hospitality."
10520,Date of experience: August 2014,31-Aug-14,SEC,South Carolina,3,Excellant Venue but Poor Exit Strategy for Traffic,"We were in town for the Texas A&M vs South Carolina game on 28 August, 2014.  The stadium and fairgrounds are actually very nice as were the people working in the stadium and fairgrounds.  The food at the stadium was overpriced and needs updating, pasty nacho cheese and stale chips with $5 water, yummy.Entering and exiting the stadium and surrounding area is horrific.  We arrived at the fairgrounds for an alumni tailgate and had a great time prior to the game in the 95 degree heat.  The bathrooms on the fairground were clean both before and after the game.  Good organization there.  Trying to get from the fairgrounds into Williams Brice is made difficult with a street that bisects the area between the two locations.  Most other college stadiums and professional venues close off those streets an hour or two prior to game time to allow easier accessibility to either area....just seemed silly when it could be solved rather quickly just by blocking the road.  People will adapt to the route being closed and people attending the game won't be subjected to almost being run over entering and or leaving the game.The gameday environment was excellent and the fans were fun to chat with.....there was the usual number of unruly drunk fans and this is always expected even from the best football fans with a game late in the day.After the game.......just wow.  I have never seen a more disorganized exit strategy for a football game from the fairgrounds back out to the roads.  Whoever came up with how you get the traffic out of the area should go to a class on how to do it, because, that was the WORST."
10521,Date of experience: August 2014,30-Aug-14,SEC,South Carolina,4,Exiting is a joke!,Made it to our car minutes after the game only to sit in park for 1.5 hours while cops block the road to let busses fill up over and over and let people out. I went on the university website before the game and printed out their instructions for parking and best way to exit the stadium. Didn't matter. Nice stadium but please take the shuttle and only the shuttle. All our friends that did beat us to the bar post game by an hour and a half and we left our seats at the same time.
10522,Date of experience: August 2014,29-Aug-14,SEC,South Carolina,4,Season opening visit,"Visited Williams-Brice in August for season opener Gamecocks game. I purchased my ticket through my school's athletic foundation, so our seats were not fantastic, but the view was very good. Being on the upper deck, I appreciated the 4 wide ramps up the the upper level. It was also nice that the seats on the east side upper deck were not at too extreme an angle. We could still see fine, but we didn't feel like we were standing on the folks in front of us shoulders like some stadiums. The aluminum bleachers have backs which is also not found in all college facilities. A few negatives from my vantage point. . . it was in August and so quite hot (95+ at kickoff), yet the concessions near my section began running out of 1 liter bottles of water in the first quarter. They still carried the other, smaller bottles, but I would have expected them to be better prepared. It's a lot easier to carry fewer bottles to get more water than a lot of the smaller bottles. I sat in section 508, yet my ticket read to enter at Gate 18. Gate 18 was on the north side of the east side, but section 508 is on the south of the east side. So we walked what seemed like a very long distance just to walk back the way we'd come. Not sure if that was traffic flow or what, but it seemed like a long way out of the way for us. Another example of extra walking came when we asked an usher for assistance. When we first arrived, we walked up to the vomitory and showed our tickets to the attendant. We had seats 1 and 2, and asked where we should go up. He sent us up the steps (around 40 rows), but when we arrived we were on the wrong end of the row. This meant we had to ask many people to stand up to let us pass. It was the first game, so I'll say it's not that big of a deal; however, the ushers main function should be to guide people with questions like ours. This shouldn't be that difficult. The other criticism is the men's bathrooms in our area had the large trough-style urinals. I was sort of surprise by this because the rest of the stadium seems much more modern than ones where I expect to find that level of accommodation. On the other hand, the lines at the men's rooms were fine, so the trade-off is probably worth it. We only had water, hot dogs and boiled peanuts. Those were fine but nothing special. Only one vendor came up to our section and that was at the end of the fourth quarter. He had one drink with him. No complaint about that as we were high up in the visitor's sections, but thought it worth noting for others. The atmosphere was quite good as one would expect at an SEC venue. The USC fans engaged in some minor smack-talk but were basically polite and simply pulling for their team. Our interaction with them, both before and after the game was positive. I would have no problem bringing young children to a game here. If your team is playing here, I highly recommend planning on attending."
10523,Date of experience: August 2014,29-Aug-14,SEC,South Carolina,3,Plan on two hours to get out,"We chose to take a cab to the Texas A&M game, after hearing that parking was difficult.  Getting there in the cab was easy.  The tailgating was really fun and the college football atmosphere in the stadium was electric.  Leaving the game was terrible.  We had no idea that there would be absolutely no way to catch a cab on the way out.  When we called the cab company after the game, they essentially laughed at us.  The stadium is in an industrial area with no businesses or restaurants.  We waked over three miles to finally get to an intersection where traffic was moving and we could get a cab.  Lesson: DRIVE to this stadium!"
10525,Date of experience: November 2013,1-Aug-14,SEC,South Carolina,4,Good venue with updates,"The stadium has been updated, but could still use some improvements.  Sure this is not the NFL, but it is the home stadium to a high-caliber SEC football team.  Improving the restrooms would go a long way to create a better fan experience."
10526,Date of experience: September 2013,1-Aug-14,SEC,South Carolina,1,"Rude people, hot stadium","The fans were RUDE. We had on our visiting team colors UNC but were not loud or obnoxious. While we were walking from our car, people yelled obscenities, even though we had small children in the group.We followed our band into the stadium, just to watch USC fans throw cans at the band!   Once inside, we were abused the entire game.For a team with such a terrible football history, I guess their fans have not yet learned how to gracefully accept a little success."
10527,Date of experience: October 2013,3-Jul-14,SEC,South Carolina,5,Game day is AWSUME,"The Gamecock experience is outstanding. One of the top football settings in the country.

10533,Date of experience: November 2013,4-Feb-14,SEC,South Carolina,3,The place was rocking,"I went to the USC-Florida game was impressed with the rocking crowd.  When the crowd gets going the stadium literally shakes, it is quite the experience.  You definitely feel a part of the action.  I was not a fan of either team, but the experience of game was definitely worth it. With that being said the actual facility and management need some attention.  I know this is a college stadium, but the kid behind us threw up most of the first half.  The staff actually showed up and clean up around him, threw down some moisture absorbent and air freshener and left him in the seats barely unable to sit up.  Thank goodness it was not a hot day.  The time it took to get to our seats was ridiculous and the lines were long and time consuming. Even with some the issues faced, the trip was worth it."
10534,Date of experience: September 2013,29-Jan-14,SEC,South Carolina,1,WILL NEVER GO BACK!,"I visited this place to see my Tar Heels play the Gamecocks in the season opener on a Thursday night in September.  I travel to see my Heels play all the time, so have visited many college football stadiums the past few years.  I have to say that this place is the absolute worst I've ever been.  As another reviewer said, these fans are the rudest I've ever encountered.  We had a Rams Club tailgate prior to the game, held just down the street at a venue, which we PAID to rent out and have our tailgate, but we were not allowed to park there even if we paid.  They said it was reserved for season ticket holders.  Ok, so we continued to drive further down the road and find additional parking; we finally found a grassy lot and paid.  While we were hiking from our car to our tailgate, people yelled obscenities and threw items, so much so that we had to cross the road to get away from them and at times even walking in the middle of the road. We followed our band from our tailgate space to the stadium, at which time USC fans threw trash in our direction, yelled at us, and spit their tobacco at us.  I have never seen such behavior!  Once inside, we were in our seats in OUR section.  Somehow USC fans were seated at the end of our row also.  They chose to come ALL the way down to our side to exit the row despite them being closer to the aisle on their side.  One girl even shoved me from behind when she was exiting.  Later on in the game, liquid and cups were thrown down to us from who knows where.  USC fans should be ashamed of themselves.  The majority of them are just locals who have never even attended USC, are uncivilized, and poorly represent the school by the behaviors exhibited during game days.  I would NEVER visit this place ever again.  There's only ONE Carolina and we are far more welcoming of visiting teams than any of these people raised in barns."
10535,Date of experience: November 2013,11-Jan-14,SEC,South Carolina,5,Love watching USC Football Games there,Watched Arkansas and USC play in November.  The stadium is awesome and you will have a great time there!
10536,Date of experience: November 2013,7-Dec-13,SEC,South Carolina,1,"Rude people, even the staff!","As a visitor to Williams-Brice stadium be prepared for the worst experience you'll ever encounter at a football stadium. On the walk into the stadium people threw trash, bottles, and cans at our group of 7 and yelled obscenities. Once inside, more bottles and trash were thrown into the visitor's section, mini bottles were hurled at our cheerleaders, and our players were spit on and had various liquids from puke to bourbon thrown down on them as the entered and left the field. After the game the staff (gate tenders) harassed us on the way out, sticking their hands in our faces. Once outside, more trash and liquids were hurled at us, and numerous people deliberately bumped into us trying to knock us down. While waiting for our players to board the bus, their fans gathered around taunt them and fans from the balconies above spit down on us and our players. We literally feared for our lives as we walked back to our cars. I watched two guys run up behind an elderly couple, scream at them, and one hit the old man in the back as hard as he could then ran off calling them names. Every single visitor we talked with that night and the next day said they would NEVER go to another game there again. If the gamecock fans are trying to intimidate people it worked! I've been to a lot of college games over the last 30 years and I have never experienced anything like this!!!"
10537,Date of experience: November 2013,4-Dec-13,SEC,South Carolina,3,Great if you are a USC fan - terrible if you are not.,"This is a loud loud loud stadium.  The new jumbotron sound system could ruin you hearing if you stayed in there too long.  The majority of the fans have spirit, but it is mean spirit if you are a visiting team. We were not even allowed to park our vehicle in the USC lot adjacent to the stadium unless we removed our team flags and decals from our vehicle.   The workers, especially the food service people in the box areas are very helpful and nice.  We will NEVER return to place."

When the Gamecocks do well, it is deafening!  The fans are the 12th player.  The updates that have been done to this facility only add to the festive air!  The jumbo tron is great for replays.  Nothing is better than hearing Sandstorm starting and 85,000 Gamecock fans jumping to their feet, waving the towels and dancing!  Go Cocks!"

Gamecocks and garnet and black everywhere. Some of the tailgates actually serve food (!) to their guests and the smell of barbeque is is available to all. I am a Gamecock parent and the southern hospitality and tight-knit enthusiasm for their team is contagious."
10562,Date of experience: October 2012,20-Jan-13,SEC,South Carolina,5,SEC Football at its Best,Very pretty and well maintained stadium. Sit on the West side if it is a day game because the sun will be at your back.The tailgating area that was built on the former grounds of the South Carolina Flea Market is AWESOME and makes the game a full day event.
10563,Date of experience: September 2012,18-Jan-13,SEC,South Carolina,3,"Very average, but large college stadium.","It is a big stadium and Gamecock fans will pack it out, so they have to get credit for that. However, it isn't close to campus, and the tailgating spots are average at best. Some of the tailgating spots are downright depressing as you are forced to tailgate in an industrial district.Having been to dozens of college football stadiums, this one isn't really special in any way. It is, however, an SEC stadium so it will host some pretty solid match ups."

However, once you venture out to get a drink or snack beware the long lines, the narrow corridors and the slow paced concession staff.  I was disappointed at the number of the food kiosks that were out of food at halftime.  In addition, the regular concession stands were seemingly located in the narrow sections of the stadium creating a log jam between the people waiting in line for food and the people looking to walk past in order to get to their seats.  In addition, the staff working the concession stands were either undermanned or incredibly slow.  Thus the log jam!"

We have been to stadiums all around the eastern half of the country. This is the most exciting place we have been to to watch a college football game.
10577,Date of experience: October 2012,15-Oct-12,SEC,South Carolina,5,It's Saturday in South Carolina,"Welcome to Williams-Brice.85,000 of your closest friends cheering for the Gamecocks! Not a bad seat in the house..it gets crazy when Sandstorm begins."
10578,Date of experience: October 2012,9-Oct-12,SEC,South Carolina,5,"85,000+","The stadium was a packed house with 100,000 people in and around the stadium for the Georgia game. SC fans take their football and tailgating traditions very seriously. The recently renovated farmers market makes a great tailgating station."
10579,Date of experience: October 2012,8-Oct-12,SEC,South Carolina,5,Beautiful,Truly enjoyed the festivities.   Beautiful field and love the new video board.  Fans are great.  The new farmers market is out of this world.
10581,Date of experience: September 2012,26-Sep-12,SEC,South Carolina,4,EXPENSIVE PARKING,Friendly and gracious 'event staff.'  The restrooms weren't super clean even before the game started.  The $40 charge to park seems a bit over the top.
10582,Date of experience: September 2012,24-Sep-12,SEC,South Carolina,4,Improvements to Williams-Brice Stadium,A brand new video board installed in the north end of the stadium is spectacular. Not only can you see replays of events the board also displays a live broadcast of the game. Most all seating offers good views of the game aside from the seats along the sidelines behind the players. Parking has been revised. Spots in the Old Farmer's Market go from $280 to $500. All spots in Farmer's Market require a parking pass. Generally speaking getting out of the stadium and back on the road is far easier than in other stadiums.
10584,Date of experience: October 2011,13-Sep-12,SEC,South Carolina,4,First NCAA Game,"I was lucky enough to make the drive from Myrtle Beach to the stadium early in the season, without tickets, and got a pair from a scalper.What an amazing atmosphere! The crowd was defining, the pre-game done my the school's marching band was really cool, the student section was amazing to watch and, there was a significant section set apart for the visiting team's fans.No beer was sold on site, which didn't bother me, but I found it a little strange. The whole town shuts down, very much like going to an NFL game in Buffalo. But in this case even the roads shut down. Very cool atmosphere, I loved every second of it."
10585,Date of experience: September 2012,13-Sep-12,SEC,South Carolina,5,Great Updates!,"With the additional seating, I expected to have more trouble getting in and out of the stadium.  The new parking areas actually made it much easier to get in and out.  The new Jumbotron is really fantastic!"
10586,Date of experience: September 2012,12-Sep-12,SEC,South Carolina,5,What can you say?  Terrific and USC wins again!,"Visiting on Saturday September 8th for the USC versus ECU game, it was a 12:15 game and HOT in the stands.  But the Gamecocks were HOT too and almost handed ECU a shutout; but ECU did add some points much later in the game.  USC was terrific, the first game of the year and everyone was pumped.  USC played well; hope they continue.  Although the stands were very hot, it was a fun day.  We opted to leave at half time and go to an air conditioned spot to finish watching the game due to the heat on us and our feeling the effects of the sun.  Overall a wonderful experience though!  GO COCKS!"
10587,Date of experience: September 2011,27-Aug-12,SEC,South Carolina,5,GAMEDAY FUN!,This venue is only fun for 8 or 9 days out of the year.  That is because the University of South Carolina only has 7 home games and 1 big scrimmage a year. (known as the Garnet and Black game aka the Spring Game)  They also have concerts here from time to time.  Williams-Brice on Gameday is a great experience. Whether you are not into football or you are a college football fan you gotta come to Columbia to see a game.  USC has just redone most of the area around the stadium and it is beautiful.  Tailgating is a lot of fun so make sure you show up well in advance.  Tickets range from around 30-60 bucks a ticket.  GO GAMECOCKS!
10588,Date of experience: September 2011,5-Jul-12,SEC,South Carolina,3,Non-partisan view,"I have been to 2 football games at South Carolina and the game experience itself, while not the greatest in all of college football, is certainly on par with most other top flight SEC schools.  The measure of a stadium to me though is a combination of game day experiences, the aesthetics of the building and the surrounding area.  That is where Williams Brice gets a knock.  It's certainly an impressive structure but the entire fairgrounds where it is located are just dumpy and unappealing.  The stadium is essentially an enormous concrete structure in a wasteland.  It is not necessarily the University's fault but outside of the game experience, it's hard to view the stadium as a destination unto itself."
10589,Date of experience: November 2011,11-Jun-12,SEC,South Carolina,5,BEST FOOTBALL EXPERIENCE IN THE NATION!,"As an avid Gamecock fan, I am telling you.... This is the place to be on football Saturday's in SC."
10591,Date of experience: September 2022,18-Sep-22,SEC,Tennessee,2,VERY Disappointed,"With all the hoopla and bragging by friends we expected much better. My first visit and LAST! Entry was a living nightmare, insane LONG lines with fans cutting in front of you everywhere.22 min. in line to buy $13 popcorn and an over priced bottle of water! WHY? Other fans around us spent longer trying to purchase food etc. missing nearly a full quarter of play. It??s unbelievable they haven??t figured out how to serve guests faster! Something, anything is better than this archaic boondoggle!Seats were OK but the stadium audio system is SOOO bad, you can??t understand a word said by the referees for example.Echoing, reverberation and in general awful!Yes, UT is a great team this year and won handily, but paying this much money for disgusting customer service is despicable!!WAKE UP!!!!"
10592,Date of experience: October 2021,25-Oct-21,SEC,Tennessee,5,SEC football at its best,"A group of friends and I take a yearly Sports Trip consisting of  a College football game, NFL and baseball game. This year we went to watch the Tennessee vs. Ole Miss game (10/16/20)... This has been to date  the best College Football game and atmosphere that I have been to...and I have been to Notre Dame, Georgia, LSU, Clemson, Texas A&M, USC, UCLA. The crowd was awesome, until you are in a stadium with 102455 fans screaming you have not experienced college football at its best! The fans are nice, unless you are Lane Kiffern but he deserves everything they gave him. I would recommend getting there early enough to watch the Vol walk, and absolutely get a parking pass ahead of time. The G10 parking structure is worth paying for it is literally right next to the stadium."
10593,Date of experience: September 2021,20-Sep-21,SEC,Tennessee,2,"Just ""No"" for college football","Went for a college football game.Pro:  A lot of fans show up for football games.Cons: Neyland Stadium is old, decrepit and a risk management nightmare.  While going up to our seats in section 41, we walked by piles of rock, probably covered by mold, surrounded by barbed wire.  You know the kind they have on top of prison fencing. The concourses are narrow, dark, and there is no seating.  I saw a woman who was not feeling well slumped on the ground on the dirty cement.  The women's restrooms had half a door on the stalls (the kind you had in grade school).   You could see each woman in her stall.  Since the entrances and exit doors are open, everyone coming down the concourse can look at you.   People were allowed to vape in their seats which was annoying.  The rows are very narrow - your knees will hit the back of the person in front of you of while the person behind you knees your back.  There are a number of seats in each row in the stadium so you are up and down all game as people go in and out.  We could not hear the announcer - bring your own radio.  The biggest issue is that the stairs have no handrails.  I witnessed an older woman go down the stairs twice during the game, however, she could not make it back up the stairs with her popcorn and drinks in her hand.  Luckily, twice a fan got up and helped her back to her seat.  This is a huge risk management issue for the Vols and I'm shocked nothing has been done to date.  If the stairs are not wide enough to meet code to put up railings, they should consider providing student escorts for people who have mobility or balance issues.  This place is a dump!"
10594,Date of experience: September 2021,8-Sep-21,SEC,Tennessee,5,This is what big-time college football is all about,"The first time I visited Neyland Stadium in Knoxville, Tennessee, the home of the University of Tennessee's football team, I cajoled a security guard into unlocking the gate and letting me walk onto the field. This time, I was among 84,000 people who attended the Tennessee/Bowling Green game. Quite a difference. But I could only imagine what the experience would be like in front of a capacity crowd of 102,455. Located at 1235 Phillip Fulmer Avenue, on the University of Tennessee campus, overlooking the Tennessee River, Neyland Stadium has been described as the No. 1 college football stadium in the country, the fifth largest stadium in the United States, the second largest in the football-happy Southeastern Conference. Named after General Robert Neyland, who coached Tennessee's football team from 1926 to 1952 and is credited with making the Volunteers a national football power, it was built in 1921 and has undergone three major renovations and 14 expansions since then. How big is college football in the SEC? In 2004, Tennessee implemented the Neyland Stadium Master Plan, a long-term strategy for expanding, renovating and maintaining the stadium.  The plan's five phases are nearly completed at at estimated cost of over $200 million, funded entirely by private donations and revenue generated from priority and club seats. One of the spiffy additions was the Peyton Manning Locker Complex. Another was the Hank Lauricella Center for Letter Winners. Both named for former Tennessee All-Americans. Don't forget the statue of General Neyland at the west entrance.  One of the unique features of the football field is the orange-and-white checkerboard end zones. Oh, Neyland Stadium and adjacent Thompson-Boling Arena have their own underground parking facility. But it's not nearly big enough to hold all of the cars for 104,455 football fans. Arrive early and plan to stay late."

10597,Date of experience: October 2019,27-Jan-20,SEC,Tennessee,4,A Good Time - One Small Flawed Detail,"This is an exciting Stadium with fans that drive, wear, scream, and bleed orange in the most loyal tail gating sort of way and all their traditions that go way way back. They even plan their weddings around the games in this stadium in order to have guests come for their special day.  Use to be you could not by a beer in the stadium but that is now being offered along with some new snack and food choices.  The acoustics are good in the stadium for watching the band at half time.  Season tickets can be difficult to obtain.  The flaw is in the very top rows of the stadium where you must place one foot in front of the other and my 5'6"" frame found my knees in the back of the person in front of me...the architect on this addition must have been mad ""packing them in"" like that.  Expect parking to be challenging and long lines leaving the stadium."

Although the game was delayed by weather twice we loved it! Such an awesome stadium and great fans. We had a great time and although driving back to Nashville in a driving rain storm was difficult at times, we will be back. Watching and experiencing 100,000 plus fans singing Rocky Top was amazing.

10601,Date of experience: November 2019,18-Nov-19,SEC,Tennessee,3,"Holds lots of people, but facilities dated.","First time for me at Neyland Stadium.  Located next to a river on the southside means that parking sucked.  Over 84,000 people attended/descended on the stadium .  Unfortunately, this meant lots of congestion in narrow walkways with food vendors, souvenier vendors and restrooms. Couple this with emergency medical carts trying to zoom people to help and it became barely managed chaos.  When concert let out the chaos resumed.   Lack of police helping to move heavy traffic out of downtown and even support persons to help crowds move efficiently meant long waits either on the streets or post  game parking lots.  Clemson does much better at managing traffic.   Clearly if you want to see a game or concert and this is the venue you will need to go, but plan ahead and don't be in a hurry...pack a snack in your car."
10603,Date of experience: November 2019,17-Nov-19,SEC,Tennessee,5,Garth Brooks Concert of the year,Wow. What can we say. This place is enormous and well designed with only one flaw. It has these really small breeze ways that clog up when there is over 1000 people trying to get a beer or to their seats.
10606,Date of experience: September 2019,13-Nov-19,SEC,Tennessee,2,No handrails on the stairways,"We attended a University of Tennessee game here in September 2019.  Even though there was a huge crowd, getting in to the stadium was pretty easy, and there was plenty of parking a few blocks out that was reasonably priced.  My big complaint is that our seats were 14 rows below the level where you walk out of the tunnel on the upper level.  They are narrow cement steps and there are no handrails.  For someone with knees that are less than stable, it was terrifying trying to go down the steps with nothing to hang on to.  I was sure my knee would give and I would fall to the bottom. On the upside, I could sue Neyland Stadium for a lot of money, right?  I think it is inexcusable for them not to have hand railings from a safety perspective.  We attended college football games at 3 other stadiums this year, and ALL of them had railings.  Get with the program UT!"
10607,Date of experience: November 2019,11-Nov-19,SEC,Tennessee,5,Awesome Experience,Had a great time at the game and the Vols won. The fans were great! We couldn't have asked for a better SEC experience.

10609,Date of experience: November 2019,3-Nov-19,SEC,Tennessee,4,Visiting Team Parking,"Attended the homecoming game.  After reading other reviews about where to park, we chose to park downtown and walk.  We arrived at the parking garage on Locust Street at 6:00 for a 7:00 game and paid $20.  We followed the crowd across the pedestrian bridge @ Locust & Clinch to 11th Street, turned left straight to the stadium. We picked up our visiting player tickets at gate 22. We were in our seats at 6:20.We saw some parking lots closer to the stadium for $40."

This was the first game with my husband and the last time I was here, I was with my stepmom who passed away in 2016. The atmosphere was just electric. Seats for the game weren't too bad, Section R, row 20. The VOL Shop was extremely busy but what would I expect on gameday, lol!?! The BBQ place wasn't too bad. We bought the combos to give us the souvenir cups. The only complaint that my husband had was the beer lines took about 15-25 minutes."

This is the first season they sell beer!!"
10613,Date of experience: October 2019,11-Oct-19,SEC,Tennessee,5,The Vols Shop,"If you are searching for anything Vols related, check out the Vols Shop.  If you can't find what you are looking for in this shop, you will never find it."
10614,Date of experience: October 2019,11-Oct-19,SEC,Tennessee,5,Still Home Sweet Home to Me!,"I have been going to games at this stadium since I was 4. There really is not a bad seat in Neyland unless you are afraid of heights. If that is the case, the upper deck might not be for you. Steps are very steep up there and you are high up in the night sky. Neyland has been thru many iterations over the years including the full enclosure of the upper deck, the second sky box, large jumbotron and now the addition of beer sales!! Yes, I  wish we were winning more, but there is nothing like going to a game here. Some tips worth knowing:- give yourself enough time to go thru security to enter the stadium - they check everyone- NFL bag rules apply here so ladies, leave your big Louies at home. Clear bags or small bags only.- If you want to see the team run thru the T up close and personal, you need to sit near Y8. That is the end where the team runs out of the tunnel. - Sections Z thru L face the sun and when you are sitting in it, you better wear sunscreen because it is due West.- Calhouns on the River is directly across from Neyland and a great place to grab a cocktail and watch the Volunteer Navy pull in but if you want a table, you better get there early.- You must have a parking pass to park in the lots. Knoxville PD does not play around with this. - Bookstore is within walking distance of Neyland and anyone can tell  you where it is.- The beer stand takes cash and credit cards.- The beer line is LONG so just deal with it. You are getting beer in Neyland. It is worth it.- Yes, Neyland used to have dorm rooms in it. My father lived in the stadium when he was there many years ago. Last I heard, those rooms are now offices. - Part of section E and F are the student section. They don't sit the entire game so if you don't want part of that, then don't sit there. - Section H is where the band sits. I personally love the song Rocky Top but if you don't want a tuba blowing that in your face every 5 seconds, you might want to sit in a different section. - Section A and a little bit of Z are the sections where the visitors  sit the most. - There are ATMs in the stadium.Neyland is a great old stadium and named for an amazing man and countryman, General Neyland who coached at Tennessee, left to go to WW1, came back and coached, left again to go to WW2, came back and coached. He won national championships at TN and never lost a game to Bear Bryant. If you go, enjoy the time. Another great stadium in the SEC."
10615,Date of experience: September 2019,9-Oct-19,SEC,Tennessee,5,We love to watch the VOLS play win or lose,Tons of seats ... not much room between seats ... food is great . Security is great ... VOL WALK AND BAND IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE

10617,Date of experience: September 2019,20-Sep-19,SEC,Tennessee,5,SO MUCH ENERGY!,"A Vols game is a must-do. The BYU game was our first. The pre-game band march gave me goose bumps. Everyone was singing ""Rocky Top"" as the band marched by. They stopped and played in the street for a bit before heading to the stadium. So steeped in tradition. Very loud, so ear plugs are a must if it's sold out."
10618,Date of experience: September 2019,10-Sep-19,SEC,Tennessee,5,Orange Crush,"Nice fans, very passionate!   We went to see two teams we had never seen before and were not thinking when we wore blue shirts-BYU blue.    Got a lot of good natured kidding from the Vol fans.   A bit less good natured after their Vols were beaten by BYU.    Still a very nice game but the stadium is getting old."
10619,Date of experience: August 2019,3-Sep-19,SEC,Tennessee,5,GSU upset the Vols!,The most important part of our experience at Neyland were the people. We travel to a lot of away games and Neyland is by far our friendliest college football experience. The people are friendly and helpful. Many walked up and told us how pleased they were we came and that they hoped we would enjoy the game. We did.
10620,Date of experience: October 2018,30-Jul-19,SEC,Tennessee,1,Tired old throwback to when your grandparents were in school,"Great gameday atmosphere, but as for the venue itself- maybe the worst I've ever experienced. 100K+ people crammed into a stadium that should realistically hold about 80K. Pretty much three levels all the way around, which gets you a little closer to the field, but also means an extra set of (steep and narrow) stairs, and steep viewing angles up top. Surrounding area is very hilly, and the walkways are pretty random as they carry you through loading docks, service alleys, and other scenic vistas- basically jump in the flow, start walking, and figure out where you are later. Concession and bathroom areas still retain all of their WW2 era charm, very dark,  dingy, and cramped, sort of like being in a giant dirty gerbil cage. Vols need to do like the Aggies- just take this one down and start with a clean slate."
10621,Date of experience: November 2018,22-Jul-19,SEC,Tennessee,4,"Great experience, but tight seating",Have visited for 2 football games.  Overall experience was good and tradition is enviable!  One note that made it not as enjoyable the first visit was seats in upper deck were very tight....2 girls in our row could not sit due to not enough space.  our 2nd visit our seats were in the lower bowl and was a great experience.

10625,Date of experience: September 2018,7-May-19,SEC,Tennessee,5,So exciting on gameday!  Unbelievable spirit.,Everyone should experience Neyland Stadium at least once. I've been going since I was a young girl.  You don't want to miss the Pride of the Southland marching band's halftime show.
10626,Date of experience: October 2018,7-May-19,SEC,Tennessee,4,A Must,"If you are ever in Knoxville in the Fall, then catching a UT game is a must.  Like any other University town, the activity and excitement in the stadium is electric.  Fans in Knoxville are friendly and welcoming,  If you weren't before, you just must leave as a fan of the Volunteers!"
10629,Date of experience: September 2018,20-Mar-19,SEC,Tennessee,4,great venue to watch a big football game,"At it's best when the crowd is 'into' the game; Even the upper deck seats have their charm, with their excellent visibility of everything that's going on......but bring your binoculars if you want to see close action. For afternoon games, the west side is full sun, so beware of sun burn. Great traditions at UT. Two downsides are the concessions; not much variety, unimaginative selections, overpriced and only medium quality. The second are the rest rooms; rather primitive, not enough of them and long lines anywhere near halftime. Even considering the downsides, it's a memorable event!"

That is when I learned Neyland Stadium is unique. As far as size and atmosphere, you won??t beat it; it is pretty amazing.

GO VOLS!!As for the stadium, it offers a range of options. The North and East sides have been recently renovated and are excellent venues.

It is an awesome game day experience, but just visiting when its empty there is a certain reverence you feel.  Its massive but feels intimate when packed with 110, 000 people!  Noisy and raucous all while being incredibly polite - the fans are passionate without being vitriolic .  If you get the chance this is a must experience for sports fans."

10648,Date of experience: October 2018,21-Oct-18,SEC,Tennessee,1,A real unbiased HELPFUL review!,"It??s been my son??s dream to attend a football game here so my husband and I paid the $700+ for 4 tickets for our family. We drove the 2.5 (one way) hour trip. I spent days and hours online trying to find any pertinent gameday advice. I needed a real review and it could??ve helped me. So technically we were ??visitors?? and this is our very real review:Let me start with the pros:??Nice employees/parking attendants??Extremely nice shuttle drivers(The female African-American parking attendant lot #66, female white petite ADA shuttle bus driver, and male African-American with a gold earring were especially lovely and helpful!!)??Mostly nice Vols/home fans??A free shuttle and parking for the disabled(Ag Campus. Arrive hours early, only 150 spaces)??Nice, kept, clean fieldHere??s the cons:??The campus is huge with minimal parking nearby which is reserved for season/local ticket holders. There is NO parking by 3 hours prior to the game. If you??re lucky enough to find parking, which would be 40-65 dollars and 3+ miles of walking. Or you could pay an additional $10 per person to ride a bus. ??Traffic is a nightmare! Forget about following directions or GPS because the cops have most side roads closed. It??s also crazy because they??re directing traffic and lanes are merging periodically...madness. ??I had my handicap placard displayed and we circled several times looking for ADA parking at the Ag. Campus, lot #66. There??s no signs and no directions. ??Luckily we had a nice shuttle but the ride to the stadium is 20+ minutes of riding as the driver tried to maneuver through the traffic. Also on the trip back, the directing cops were of no assistance and allowed our bus to sit at a left turn for at least 12-15 minutes and didn??t even turn and acknowledge a HANDICAP bus behind them. ??Once at the stadium campus we hiked up a dozen flights of stairs to our gate #22. Lines moved very quickly and we entered and began our ascension to our seats. ?? ??SEATS?? is not even a correct word. There are 32 people on each row of metal and cement bleachers which MAY BE a foot wide to sit on. *we had 4 tickets and 2 people were in our seats. We couldn??t even squish our way in. A Vol fan on the end refused to slide down to allow us in. I was EXTREMELY disappointed that the seat ??attendant?? would not take initiative and make that fan move. The others squeezed together and we sat down. It was horrible. Each row should ideally hold no more than 20-22 people. Shame on the design and greediness of this arena. If you??re over 5??6, 135 lbs then you??re going to be miserable sitting on these ??seats??. *Seats also have no leg room so there are knees in your back and your knees in some else??s back. I??m assuming this is why you can no longer bring stadium seats with arms. There??s no room for human arms, much less chair arms. (My husband and youngest son had to leave before half time and stand inside due to leg cramps and back pain) ??Restrooms look less updated than National Park restrooms. They??re old and smelly. ??The prices are INSANE.   Examples: Large Fountain drink $7.00,  Soft pretzel $5.00. About 2 ounces of   Cheese for the pretzel is $2.00!   Bottled water and soft drinks $4.00*In general the sidewalks and grounds of this campus was unkempt. ??It??s a smoke free campus which is not enforced by anyone! If you decide to attend a game PLEASE splurge for seats with a back. Fans are mixed in all over the arena so don??t worry about who??s ??side?? it is. I will never be back.Very disappointed!"

This is a wonderful place to watch a college game.  Has plenty of traditions but is also trying to keep pace with modernizations.  If you go to a day game, better to sit on the west side to decrease your sun exposure.  Club level seats are awesome, like having your own recliner at the game.  East Club has beautiful views of the river while West Club you can watch the Vol Walk."

They have lots of security.  The park before you get to the Stadium is very nice just to walk around in.   We sat in section JJ in the top right below the score board the tickets were free, we could see everything, but would prefer to site closer.  Didn't eat any food so can't comment about the concessions.  Didn't use the bathroom either other than in a portable potty.  It was very crowded going into the game & coming out of the game when it was over.  Tennessee football has one of the best fan bases around. If you have never been u should go at least once to experience it."

10665,Date of experience: October 2017,20-Jul-18,SEC,Tennessee,5,Fall fix,"I want to preface this review by saying, TENNESSEE is not my team, even though I live only 20 miles from the stadium, that being said, this is an amazing venue and has a wonderful college football town, especially in the fall. This place is huge and all the seats are pretty great, I wouldn't reccommend the bleacher ones though, they tend to get a little hard and cramped over a 4 hour game. The food is pretty basic for the most part, like any other stadium, and the prices are as you guessed it, high. A couple of things, they wouldn't serve me a coke without ice, it's not hard to figure out why and watch out for fake tickets. Now, neither one of these are a deal breaker, unless you get a fake, but the local police and campus security do a great job discouraging this behavior. This is a great family atmosphere also and you will make some great memories, so pick up a couple of tickets, decent seats for around 40 or 50 bucks,  and have a blast with the rest of the 100,002 thousand, give or take a few. Be sure to come early and attend the vol walk right outside the stadium, it's a great interactive experience for all. Have fun, use common sence and Go Wolverines."

10669,Date of experience: November 2017,9-Jul-18,SEC,Tennessee,5,Visited for Tenn vs LSU game,Wonderful seats especially when the torrential rain came during half time and 3rd quarter.  We were sitting under the overhang.  Always a great stadium for a college game.
10670,Date of experience: November 2017,1-Apr-18,SEC,Tennessee,4,Tough to rate such an epic and iconic place,"This is an iconic and epic cornerstone of college football. History reeks from the concrete and brick. General Neyland's statue alone is worth a visit. If the University would truly take measures to keep alcohol and intoxicated patrons out of the stadium it would be a 5 star rated place, no hesitation, but the odds are if you attend a game here you will encounter several drunk fans and witness conflicts both verbal and physical as fans curse and act like the drunken fools they are. I have attended over 200 games here since the 60's and I have witnessed the growth of the stadium and the quality of the facility both inside and out as it inversely reflected the decline of the experience due to lack of control of the alcohol and drunks being tolerated in attendance. If there has ever been a disappointment which was also easily preventable it is that of a UT fan watching this phenomenon happen over a 50 year period of time. Sad until someone steps up and makes the changes needed to guarantee that every fan's experience here is equally as wonderful and motivating as it should be."
10671,Date of experience: October 2017,5-Mar-18,SEC,Tennessee,5,"Great experience, pricey food","Always an amazing experience.  Seating is tight.  Food/beverage prices a little pricey.  Food is delicious.  Can be loud, but it is a stadium for college football after all."

Fortunately, I have gone many times. Love those Vols and my Alma Mater. I feel quite sure the shaking inside the stadium registers on the Richter scale when the team runs through the T. Nothing compares!"
10674,Date of experience: October 2017,31-Jan-18,SEC,Tennessee,5,Home Vols football game,Great stadium. Not a bad seat in the house. Food is pricy inside as is any event venue. If you are afraid of heights be sure your seats are on one of the lower levels. Some sections very high up.
10675,Date of experience: November 2017,22-Jan-18,SEC,Tennessee,5,Best college stadium in America.,"On sold-out inter-conference games, there is no better environment in college football. Lot's of pre-game festivities and excellent tailgaiting."
10676,Date of experience: September 2017,22-Jan-18,SEC,Tennessee,5,Best place to be on a football Saturday.,Love the excitement and the crowds.  Love cheering on the Vols in a good or bad season. Nothing like Neyland on a football Saturday.
10677,Date of experience: September 2017,22-Jan-18,SEC,Tennessee,3,It's big. Really big.,"It is fun to experience an event at Neyland Stadium, but honestly, the seats are quite narrow and knee room minimal. It was uncomfortable for me to sit there for 3+ hours to get through a football game. I think the halftime show is the best part. Except for the fact that the halftime show is never presented on TV, the most comfortable seat to watch the UT Vols play is in my living room. I do have 1 memorable experience at Neyland Stadium. It was about 1969 or 1970 when Billy Graham had a crusade there. It was an honor to be able to hear him preach in person. I have respect for those dedicated Vol fans for whom comfort is not important. but for me, I'll cheer the team while sitting in front of a TV."
10678,Date of experience: October 2017,19-Jan-18,SEC,Tennessee,5,Neyland Stadium is a must visit and experience place,"Neyland Stadium is one of the greatest sports venues in the world. The feeling you get from being there, both pre game and game time, is beyond words. The Band pregame sets the stage for one of the most exciting experiences in all of sports. The Stadium, the setting on the Tennessee River, the Vol Navy, and the great people that fill the grounds outside for pregame and sit in the seats inside are without question, the best in all of sports. An experience you will have to see to believe."

10683,Date of experience: November 2017,22-Nov-17,SEC,Tennessee,5,2017 Vol N Tears ... but wait 'til next year !!!,"One of the TOP places in the country to play college football. Going to see the VOLS play in Neyland Stadium is one of the best venues you'll ever experience.  With over 101,000 of your closest friends (most wearing Orange and White), this is a can't miss experience if you're a college fan.

10690,Date of experience: September 2017,23-Oct-17,SEC,Tennessee,5,Awesome,"We went to the University of Tennessee Vols football game. It's a fantastic stadium & there's not a bad place to sit where you can't see the game & the seating is comfortable and roomy. I recommend anyone to go to a University of Tennessee football game whether they are winning or losing, it's an experience you would really enjoy."
10691,Date of experience: October 2017,17-Oct-17,SEC,Tennessee,2,"Uncomfortable, old and poor parking","I have been to many stadiums and I would rank this as one of the worse,  we have been to the university for other sports events and have seen the stadium but this was our first time going to a game.  Parking is terrible.  The only way you can park near the stadium on campus is if you are a season ticket holder or something close to that.  We had to park downtown and walk about 20 minutes.  I will say it was a nice walk since the area around the stadium is nice.Entry wasn't terrible.  Lines moved pretty quickly.  All seats except for a few areas was bleacher seating.  The seat numbers are very close together so we were packed in though it was not a sell out.  The seats were obvouisly uncomfortable.  The stadium had an old look and feel, no character.  The sound system was good and we liked the announcer.  The bathrooms were small but did not present to much of a problem.I really have no desire to go back."
10692,Date of experience: October 2017,17-Oct-17,SEC,Tennessee,5,Georgia Tennessee game,Great place to watch a college football game. I am a huge Georgia Bulldogs fan and this is my favorite place to come for a UGA road game. The stadium is huge and not a bad set in the house. The atmosphere and fans are great for college football. This is defiantly one of college footballs great cathedrals and it is right in the heart of SEC country. This is a most see if you are a true college football fan.
10693,Date of experience: October 2017,15-Oct-17,SEC,Tennessee,5,Great place to watch a game,Our first college football game.  Very good experience.  The stadium is in the middle of the campus.  Parking is limited to season pass holders.  All the staff was very helpful.  We parked at the Farragut High School 15 minutes south of campus and rode the shuttle.  GREAT bargain!  Our seats were is bleacher-type seats in section AA.  AMAZING location for view of the field.  Noon kickoff.  If it had been later in the day it might have been hotter.  Next time we will try to find a location that has specific seats as the bleachers were TOO packed.

10697,Date of experience: September 2017,2-Oct-17,SEC,Tennessee,3,About as uncomfortable a place to watch a football game as exists.....,"Trying to find your way around/into the stadium is difficult due to lack of signage and walkways are confusing and make no sense as some simply end at a post or cross beam.  Concourses are tight, crowded, and what little space exists is filled w/ vending.  The lower level concourses are almost depressing as they are so dark and dank.  Seating is extremely tight (you can see where they renumbered the seats in order to fit more spectators into the place) and the upper deck is seriously slanted so it is difficult to get up and down the steps and if you have vertigo be prepared.  Since a refurbishment a few years ago it does not look as much like a mangled erector set as it did but aesthetics are one thing as it is still downright depressing inside."
10698,Date of experience: September 2017,1-Oct-17,SEC,Tennessee,3,Overrated. Rusty and uncomfortable seating.,"A big stadium that says they seat over 100,00. Seats are tiny. A normal sized person cannot sit in the designated space without turning at an angle! Upper deck is very, very steep...dangerously so. Speaker system need work, and it was not clear at all. Outside of the stadium is rusty, with peeling paint. Buildings right beside stadium look like they need to be condemned...also with rust and peeling paint. Handicapped seating  on the concourse level is terrible. Tiny, folding chairs, and had to stand up to see the field, because people in regular seats were blocking the view. (Which defeats the purpose of having a handicapped seat for those who have a hard time getting up and down.) Not enough bathrooms...long walk from our seats to them. Crowd event staff were very friendly, but not very knowledgeable."
10699,Date of experience: September 2017,27-Sep-17,SEC,Tennessee,3,Very old school stadium,"They say it seats 100,000, but it really seats about 80,000, most of the seats metal benches no backs and you spot is very small width and no leg room.  Little room around sidelines so you are close to the field.  Normal sport event prices on food, you can only carry in a CLEAR see through bag, you can carry in water in a closed plastic bottle.  Upper deck is old school on an extreme angle so if you have trouble going up and down stairs don't even try the upper deck seats."

I spent over twenty years in the armed forces listening to football games sometimes three weeks later but I could picture myself there with the voice of John Ward carrying me home. Now that I am back I try to not miss a single game because the roar of the crowd carries on hours after the game. I do bleed orange but have siblings that are from other football faiths but it doesn't dampen our collective enthusiasm for attending games in Neyland Stadium regardless who plays. I always w=root for Tennessee to win but I am behind our team regardless of the  outcome, they get in your heart and you don't change that with a score."
10713,Date of experience: August 2016,11-Jul-17,SEC,Tennessee,5,Beautiful Stadium,A Tennessee Vols game at Neyland Stadium is the best experience to see what being a Tennessean is all about.  This is a gorgeous stadium in the heart of Knoxville.
10717,Date of experience: October 2016,2-Jul-17,SEC,Tennessee,5,Loved It!,"I loved going to Neyland Stadium although we did not win the game. The view of the field was awesome, and noisy. When we went, the noise level was at 121 decibels. The music is loud also."
10718,Date of experience: September 2016,1-Jul-17,SEC,Tennessee,4,Good memories,"The stadium construction allows for a good view of the field from most of the seats, and even in the upper levels it is enjoyable.  I have seen the Vols lose to Florida several times, UCLA, Alabama (several times) and Georgia and even MS. State once during the Dooley era.  It's hard to describe the emotion you feel watching the faces of the fans as they suffer another loss and talk about ""Next year"".  it is well worth the cheap tickets you can get towards the end of the season as they realize they will not play for the SEC title yet again.  And if you can be there when they get beat by Kentucky or Vanderbilt, it is pure euphoria.  If you enjoy SEC football, it is definitely worth a visit."
10719,Date of experience: October 2016,11-Jun-17,SEC,Tennessee,1,Just a big man-made stadium,"What is the big deal? Football in the fall? Actually, more people attend cultural events in Knoxville than UT football games."
10720,Date of experience: September 2016,24-May-17,SEC,Tennessee,4,"Not the newest, nut definately awesome","So this isn't the most high-tech and newest Stadium that you will ever visit, but it is full of so much Tennessee spirit you cannot help but have a great time. There are generally always vendors present as well, selling some of the best dogs around. Seating can become quite difficult to obtain or a totally limited unless you get your tickets early. So, come on out & enjoy. Bring your sunscreen & root for the vols!"

10726,Date of experience: October 2016,20-Apr-17,SEC,Tennessee,2,Take some ear plugs. Wear orange ear plugs.,"If you like loud, you will like the experience. For some reason, the people in charge think that loud music blaring in your face is fun. It is like we all have ADD and have to be constantly stimulated. Any time there is a break in play, they play music. A few years ago, they changed the seat width to crowd more people in a row. If you like a tight fit and knees in your back, you will enjoy it. Bring orange foam ear plugs because the noise level is over 85 decibels. Seriously. Be prepared to be searched, groped, and patted down by security on entering."
10727,Date of experience: September 2016,10-Apr-17,SEC,Tennessee,5,Ultimate college football stadium,"You haven't lived until you've seen the Volunteers play at Neyland stadium.  Even if you are not a Vols fan...or even a football fan for that matter, it's an experience that should be on everyone's bucket list.  The tradition, the pageantry of the Pride of the Southland band, the roar of the 100K + crowd...on a fall afternoon....hard to top the experience.   Well....coming by boat as part of the Vol Navy certainly enhances the adventure.  Truly experience of a lifetime everyone should try once....you'll be hooked!"
10728,Date of experience: November 2016,10-Apr-17,SEC,Tennessee,5,Best place to see a football ?? game,"Clean, lots of security great employees. Great place to see a game. Lots of food. No alcohol. Great atmosphere"
10729,Date of experience: September 2016,24-Mar-17,SEC,Tennessee,5,Don't forget to tailgate at Calhoun's on the River,"A Saturday afternoon at the University of Tennessee's Neyland Stadum in Knoxville is what college football is all about. Volunteer fans arrive by boat on the Tennessee River, enjoy a pre-game meal of BBQ baby back ribs at Calhoun's on the River, then walk up the hill to the giant 102,455-seat Neyland Stadium with the orange checker-board end zones and sounds of Rocky Top, the Vols' signature fight song. Neyland (pronounced Nee-land) Stadium was constructed in 1921 and originally called Shields-Watkins Field with a capacity of 3,200. Since then, the stadium has undergone 16 expansion projects. At one time, its capacity was 104,079. In 1962, it was renamed in honor of General Robert Neyland, who coached Tennessee from 1926 to 1952 and turned the Vols into a national football power. It is the fifth largest stadium in the United States, the sixth largest in the world and the second largest in the Southeastern Conference. In 2004, Sports Illustrated rated Neyland Stadium, the University of Tennessee campus and the surrounding Knoxville area as the best college football weekend experience. By any standard, Neyland Stadium is enormous. The largest crowd was 109,061 on September 18, 2004, when Tennessee defeated Florida 30-28. If you can't beg or borrow a ticket for a game, you can arrange for a guided tour of the stadium. Then you'll have an opportunity to visit two complexes named in honor of former Tennessee All-Americans Peyton Manning and Hank Lauricella. Afterward, stop by Calhoun's on the River for another slab of ribs."
10730,Date of experience: October 2016,22-Mar-17,SEC,Tennessee,5,A weekend experience,"whether winning or losing (hopefully winning), a weekend on the river and experiencing the game is always eventful."
10732,Date of experience: September 2016,13-Mar-17,SEC,Tennessee,5,Love Neyland Stadium,"Neyland Stadium is a very special place in the SEC. If you have never been to a UT football game, go! It will be something to remember!"
10733,Date of experience: November 2016,10-Mar-17,SEC,Tennessee,4,GAME DAY AT UT!,"Even if your blood doesn't run orange, Neyland Stadium at a home football game is an experience that will stay with you for a lifetime. The atmosphere is overwhelming. The #'s of people are staggering. Be prepared for crowds, lines, expensive concessions and prossible bathroom waits. But it is ALL worth it!"
10734,Date of experience: September 2016,10-Mar-17,SEC,Tennessee,5,I wish that I was on Old Rocky Top,"I cannot describe the Neyland Stadium experience without using words like cathedral to football immortals,  Born and raised in blue country, the liberal Northeast, my many journeys down to Tennessee have shown what real America looks and feels like.  The excitement of UT fans cheering on big orange during Saturdays in autumn remains an unparalleled phenomenon in my humble opinion.  Season ticket holders, UT students, and devoted Vols fans help make every trip to Neyland Stadium a memorable experience.  The devotion toward achievement on the gridiron by last season's Music City Bowl champions should be the top selling point for next season's individual game tickets.  I cannot think of a more moving experience than to sing Rocky Top with 102,000 other Vols fans after the big orange have taken out another worthy opponent between the checkerboards.  I invite all American football fans to share in the Neyland experience at least once in their lifetimes.  ""Good old Rocky Top, Rocky Top Tennessee....."""
10735,Date of experience: November 2016,22-Feb-17,SEC,Tennessee,5,Football Game,"Loudest stadium in the SEC with 102,455 crazy Vol fans cheering the big orange onto another victory.  Go there to be entertained or just join n the fun of screaming and singing Rocky Top"
10736,Date of experience: November 2016,13-Feb-17,SEC,Tennessee,5,GREAT PLACE TO ATTEND A COLLEGE FOOTBALL GAME,"Whether your a fan of The Big Orange or just looking to watch a College Football game, Neyland Stadium is a great venue.  Can get pretty loud with 102,000+ screaming fans.  Great atmosphere.  The band is always a treat as well."
10737,Date of experience: November 2016,3-Feb-17,SEC,Tennessee,5,It takes all day to do Neyland Stadium the right way,"If you want to get the most out of your Neyland Stadium experience, plan the whole day. Get there at least 4 hours before kickoff, preferably earlier. Start your tailgating or go roaming around the top of G10 garage, the Fraternity Row grounds, the Torch Bearer Circle, Thompson-Boling Parking Lots and all the tailgating locations, and say hello to everyone. All the tailgaters are friendly and would love to say hello to you. Drink and eat. Then watch the Vol Walk, a great tradition. Then drink some more. Then go see the Marching Band. Then take a quick 20 minute nap before its time to go to the game. College football in the South is awesome and Neyland Stadium is a great, safe, fun, happy place to enjoy this bit of Americana."
10738,Date of experience: October 2016,1-Feb-17,SEC,Tennessee,5,Great Venue,"A tremendous place to watch a college football game, especially with the recent renovations and upgrades.  As is the case with all outdoor stadiums  those considering game day individual  ticket purchases should understand the directional layout for it  can make a real difference in seat choices.  Neyland is laid out on a north south grid (south side is towards the river).   Here are a couple things to think about in this regard.  If it is a late afternoon game you don't want to sit in the upper deck on the east side of the stadium unless you have brought along a billed hat and some super good sunglasses because the sun will be shining directly in your face for an extended period of time.  However, the same seats can be choice seats if its a cold early afternoon start for you will gwt the added benefit of the radiant warmth of direct sunlight."
10739,Date of experience: October 2016,18-Jan-17,SEC,Tennessee,5,Weekend Game with Wife,"We always enjoy the excitement & electricity associated with UT football! We tailgate, walk along the river admiring the Vol Navy, enjoy meeting fans for both teams, enjoy the ""Vol Walk"" & the overall atmosphere. The stadium has great views from just about every seat & the food is pretty good too! Even if you don't like football, go at least once to witness the enthusiasm & energy felt throughout!!"
10740,Date of experience: September 2016,17-Jan-17,SEC,Tennessee,5,My very first UT Football game,"I went to my first football game here in Knoxville last fall.  I had such a great time!  The fans are awesome, and the feeling of just being a part of such a great tradition was amazing!"

If you pick the right game you will not be disappointed.  The fans are very intense with lots of energy.  Tennessee fans are the real deal.  Go early and visit all the tailgaters.  You won't be disappointed.
10744,Date of experience: October 2016,14-Dec-16,SEC,Tennessee,5,Great atmosphere for a football game,"This is a great stadium to watch football. Fans are into the games and make sure to see the "" Vol Walk""  prior to the game. Parking is a bit of a challenge, but garages are close within walking distance. I park in G10 and it is an easy walk. Wear your orange and you will fit right in!"
10745,Date of experience: December 2016,13-Dec-16,SEC,Tennessee,5,Its great to be a Tennessee VOL!,Everyone should experience Neyland Stadium at least once! The big orange fever is contagious. So FUN!

We are die hard fans and we wanted to take our younger son for his 16th bday. Well, went we arrived everything was crazy, but fun crazy. We caught the shuttle to the stadium, and l was unaware that you couldn't bring in bags, or small purses that didn't fit their bag measurements. Well my crossbody was slightly larger that the measurements so l had to put my stuff in a plastic bag that was given to me by the security personnel. That was a real disappointment, but now l know l can bring a clear tote bag for the next time. My only Serious issue was l'm handicap and l was on a walker and they was so busy worry about my small bag that they didn't even show any Compassion for l had to walk half way of the walk ramp until a volunteer helper saw me and was in disbelieve that me and my family wasn't pointed toward the elevator entrance. The Security Team needs to be more consider of the disable or maybe they just didn't like my appearance. Other than that me and my family really enjoy our visit and will be back again, and l will know my rights and what is expected of them when you clearly seeing a person in need.Go Vols!!"
10747,Date of experience: September 2016,1-Dec-16,SEC,Tennessee,5,Great College Football Experience,We have been to this stadium several times over the years and have kids that attended UT.  The whole experience and number of fans makes for a great college football experience.  Go Vols!!!
10748,Date of experience: October 2016,23-Nov-16,SEC,Tennessee,5,There is nothing like experiencing a UT home game!,"Love the whole scene! The campus, the pre-game parties, the giveaways, and don't miss the players' walk 90 minutes before kickoff when they walk down road high-fiving the fans as they enter the stadium. Be prepared for security, though. Nothing larger than a wallet purse will be allowed into stadium including any UT items you buy at the gift/bookstore! Either wait until after the game to do your shopping or give yourself enough time to walk back to your car to leave your bags.  Security is tight, no exceptions."
10749,Date of experience: September 2016,20-Nov-16,SEC,Tennessee,5,Football,"What a fantastic time. Great atmosphere for football fans. Sears around 105K people. It's a bad house. But beware most seating is bench seating. Staff was friendly and food concessions were reasonable. Please be advised parking is a nightmare. Get there early, like I said 105K people."
10750,Date of experience: September 2016,20-Nov-16,SEC,Tennessee,5,"Highlight the trip, visit a football game","When the stands are full, and the team runs through the T onto the filed, it send chills down your spine. Wow, what an unbelievable experience that was. It helped that Tennessee won the game, but I just had a fantastic time. If you ever have the chance to visit a game, do it. You-ll enjoy it. Make it a day out, watch the team walk Paton Mannings drive, walk around the tail gate, watch the band march in, hear the anthem being sung, watch the band play, and then enjoy the game. If you drive in, forget about parking close by, impossible. The best thing to do is park in one of the carparks near market square (you may have to be early and enjoy a coffee) then take the $6 bus that leaves for hte stadium from the corner of Clinch Ave and Market St. Enjoy!"
10751,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Nov-16,SEC,Tennessee,5,Big ORANGE,"What can one say. I've been coming since the mid '80s as a season ticket holder. I bleed orange. Across the country, football is a sport. Not in Tennessee. It's a religion here and elsewhere in the south. Especially when you've got over 102,000 screaming fans dressed in orange watching our VOLS play and win. To the Vol walk to the Pride of the Southland band to the game itself, its great to be a Tennessee VOL."
10752,Date of experience: November 2016,14-Nov-16,SEC,Tennessee,4,Always an Exciting Place for a Ballgame,Went to the UT/UK ballgame Saturday. They do things up right at the arena. We watched the Vol walk and the band come down the hill before the game. Had seats on the UK side on the 50 yard line; great view of the field. Speakers close to our seat kept the music and cheering going for all of the game to keep the crowd noise up. Bathrooms are very old and could use updating but you don't have to spend much time there. Plenty of food venues but if you are gluten free or vegetarian most of the food is high fat. We really wanted a veggie Petro but they did not have those at the game and we settled for a cheese pizza. Security was fine going in and they moved us through quickly. Great weather and a great ballgame. Go Vols!
10753,Date of experience: September 2016,2-Nov-16,SEC,Tennessee,5,First game of season.,Nothing to complain about...Vols finally won the game and the stadium and everything about it was awesome!
10754,Date of experience: October 2016,31-Oct-16,SEC,Tennessee,4,A win would have been nice,What can I say? Feels like home every time I visit.  It's huge and clean and fun.  I would like to see a second Jumbo screen though for easy watching replays without having to get a sore neck.
10755,Date of experience: October 2016,26-Oct-16,SEC,Tennessee,5,Must visit of college stadiums,Been several times to Neyland. It's a must weather you are a vols fan or not. Can't wait to see stadium after the renovations. The bathrooms need it badly.

10757,Date of experience: October 2016,18-Oct-16,SEC,Tennessee,5,Felt like an NFL game.,Was an wonderful experience.  Went to the UT and AL game and although UT lost the experience was wonderful.
10758,Date of experience: October 2016,17-Oct-16,SEC,Tennessee,4,"Cramped and Uncomfortable, but STILL a Great Experience",We came to Knoxville for the Tennessee vs Alabama football game and although the game wasn't that great...the experience at Neyland Stadium was great.  The bench seating is always uncomfortable at any stadium - cramped and always getting kneed in the back - but they do a very good job with the games and the Pride of the Southland Marching Band was phenomenal!
10759,Date of experience: October 2016,16-Oct-16,SEC,Tennessee,5,"If you've never been, put watching a game in Neyland Stadium on your bucket list","If you love college football, there's no better place to enjoy a game with over 100,000 football fanatics than Neyland Stadium.  Running through the ""T"", singing Rocky Top, the checkerboard end zones, the Pride of the Southland"" Marching Band circle drill and winning football are just a few of the traditions that make this place special."
10761,Date of experience: September 2016,13-Oct-16,SEC,Tennessee,5,"Big, loud, and beautiful!","Neyland Stadium is amazing. It embodies everything that football, especially college football is all about. Big, loud, and beautiful stadium that represents a school and state  with so much tradition, history, and pride. There is nothing like SEC football, and Neyland may very well be the premier venue in the entire country. To say the least , this place is so unique that NO other stadium, professional or collegiate will offer a better experience. Part of the stadium has been modernized, but much of it is outdated still. However, this is almost appealing to many, because it adds to the traditional sports venue experience. With a campus and facility like this, why would anyone be a fan of another college team?"
10762,Date of experience: October 2016,12-Oct-16,SEC,Tennessee,5,Big Football Fan,"This stadium has been remodeled in many places and very nice.  Most of the bathrooms (women) are large, yet there are those that are still small.  Lots of places to eat, but anyplace has a great view and great to be part of the crowd.  The surrounding area is full of tailgaters."
10763,Date of experience: September 2016,3-Oct-16,SEC,Tennessee,5,Ohio vs UT,My son got me a ticket to the Ohio vs. UT game for family weekend. I had not been to Neyland Stadium in 24 years. It was just as I remembered it. The atmosphere is electric. The crowd can get loud! This is one of the best college football venues in the country and I am not a UT fan.
10764,Date of experience: September 2016,1-Oct-16,SEC,Tennessee,1,Old smelly stadium,UT squeezes so many people into the seats that you are practically sitting in each other's laps.  The facility is so old that the restrooms are way out of date.I would not recommend attending a game there.
10765,Date of experience: September 2016,29-Sep-16,SEC,Tennessee,5,Vols vs. Gators Game,A great rivalry game to watch. From the vol walk to the game. Any true big orange fan would love.  The seats in the upper bowl is not comfortable and very close together but who cares when tennessee beats florida for the first time in 11 years!!! One of the best sporting atmospheres I've ever been in. A MUST FOR every tennessee vols fan...
10766,Date of experience: September 2016,27-Sep-16,SEC,Tennessee,2,Very Disappointing,"We thought seeing at football game at Neyland Stadium was be fun, but some of the unpleasantries ruined our trip.  The walking paths to the various gates of entry are not planned well for the number of people attending the games, so it was terrible having everyone pushing each other in different directions.  The stadium ran out of water prior to half time, and yet it was tremendously hot that day.  The majority of fans yelled cheers using the ""F"" word constantly.  And the majority of the fans booed when the opposing team's hurt players were eventually able to get up and walk off the field.  I have never experienced this sort of behavior in any stadium, even though one always expects a few obnoxious fans everywhere."
10767,Date of experience: September 2016,26-Sep-16,SEC,Tennessee,5,AWESOME AWESOME,"Our 1st visit was for the TN vs FL game, GO BIG ORANGE!!! We LOVED everything about Neyland!!! The only thing I can think to complain about is the price of food and drinks!"

If it's a day event, be sure to  do your best to stay cool; it can get really hot! You have to try the hotdogs at the game. They and the bun are steamed in a foil pouch to keep warm and they are delicious.The best hotdog I've ever had."

10775,Date of experience: September 2016,5-Sep-16,SEC,Tennessee,5,So awesome!,"I went to a Vols game a few years ago and it was pretty good.  I happened to be in Knoxville recently and went to another one.  I actually like being higher up here.  If you're a bigger sized person, get two seats, you'll be glad you did.  The atmosphere for a game at Neyland is awesome!"
10776,Date of experience: September 2016,4-Sep-16,SEC,Tennessee,5,Great All American Experience,We love the ambiance of watching a football game here. People are friendly. Even to fans of the opposition!
10778,Date of experience: September 2016,4-Sep-16,SEC,Tennessee,5,It's football time on Tennessee,Neyland stadium is top notch facility that lends to having a great game time experience.  There is plenty of food options. The Jumbotron is clear as a bell.  There is not a bad seat in the place.
10779,Date of experience: September 2016,2-Sep-16,SEC,Tennessee,3,App/TN game,The stadium is big but is old and run down. I really don't get the hype.And getting into your gate is a nightmare. Tons of drunks sweating and cramming into a tiny gate. Overall the fans were great though.

It's an EXPERIENCE and Addictive!  Our Blood Runs Orange!  We LOVE the UT Volunteer Football Team!  We sing Rocky TOP!  When you leave the stadium, you will NOT have a voice...Our tailgating parties are awesome and then the traffic is so busy, you walk down to Cumberland Avenue to Copper Cellar eat or walk over to the River to Calhoun's on the River!  This was something I did ALL the time until I aspirated."

10784,Date of experience: October 2015,23-Aug-16,SEC,Tennessee,5,Go Big Orange!!!,"If you've never experienced SEC football, this is the best way to start, dive in headfirst! Once that 'sea of orange' enters this stadium, you can honestly say, you've never seen anything like it.  You can see from anywhere, and for those plays that need a review, there's always the big screen in the end zone to let you have a good look, too. And when the Vols score? Did I mention fireworks? Yeah, there's that too! If you're not a Volunteer fan when you come, you will be when you leave! Every college football fan should come here at least once in their life. No football experience like it!"

10786,Date of experience: August 2016,21-Aug-16,SEC,Tennessee,4,VFL,"Every season I look forward to coming to every home game with my husband. Neyland stadium is an experience that can hardly be described. Any Tennessee fan needs to visit Neyland and see a game in person. It's not really a place for small children. I wish the seats were just a little bit spacious. I'm only 5'10"" and my knees are always in the back of the person in front of me. And The hot dogs are awesome if you're hungry!!!"
10787,Date of experience: August 2016,18-Aug-16,SEC,Tennessee,5,Neyland Stadium,This is the place where lifetime memories are made. A special place to all Tennesseans.  A place to watch a Nationally ranked football team make its quest to be Champions.????
10788,Date of experience: October 2015,8-Aug-16,SEC,Tennessee,5,A great place for football!,Everyone should come here to experience The Vols at least once.  The excitement on game day is not to be believed until you're here.  This is one of the largest stadiums in the country and it is well maintained.

The seat size is small and therefore you are jammed together even after two to three renovations. People are drinking alcohol and some getting drunk without any oversight until it gets out of hand. Some of the bathrooms for men are troughs and dirty. The hallways are dark, dank and uninviting unless you are in the newly renovated area. A questionnaire was sent out with the sole purpose of raising more money and how much would you be willing to pay for upgrades such as seats that are comfortable and box seats Etc."

The problem is the ""seats"" are so close together that the fat guy's belly behind me was touching my back. Also, there is only one jumbo-tron screen in the whole place, so if you're sitting anywhere close to it, you can't see replays etc. Food was okay for a large venue."

The band is amazing as are most of the fans.  Lots of fun before the game around campus with lots of activities and tailgating. The South end of the stadium has been renovated so far so lots more food options at that end of the stadium.  Bring cash for food.  Not all vendors are set up for credit cards yet.

As you walk to the stadium, you'll get to see the beautiful campus of The University of Tennessee. On your way to the stadium, tailgates and crowds of people will be spread out everywhere. Locals call this, ""the sea of orange."" Soon, you will get to hear The Pride of the Southland Marching Band. Their standard is excellent and you will only ever hear the best out of them. My favorite tradition that they have, is that during pregame they play the visiting opponent's fight song. Right after this they blast Rocky Top. Neyland Stadium isn't just a stadium, it's an experience. One that will lee you coming back for a lifetime."

If you like football at all, you owe it to yourself to take in the loudest stadium in the NCAAs. Get there early for the Vol Walk and the Pride of the Southland's tribute to The Hill ... after that a short walk to the river to see the Vol Navy and its 100s of boats, but be sure to be in your seat before the Volunteers take the field running through the T ... even if you hate the Vols, its a sight to be seen.

10827,Date of experience: September 2015,8-Feb-16,SEC,Tennessee,5,On a sports fan bucket list,"I am biased because I am a TN Volunteer fan and have been a season ticket holder for decades.  However, I do travel to a lot of other sporting events and venues and I believe Neyland Stadium is a must for the diehard college football fan.  I've been told by many people that had no allegiance to TN that it was one of the best game day experiences they had ever seen.  I have been in pro stadiums like Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis that were certainly far grander than Neyland, but Neyland continues to get facelifts and upgrades to keep it ranked high on the list for nice facilities.  But what makes Neyland Stadium great is the game day atmosphere.  102,000+ screaming fans, the colors, the checkerboard end zones, the flotilla of boats (Vol Navy) on the TN River beside the stadium, the Vol Walk before the game, Volunteer Village with all of its pre-game activities, all the tailgating, etc.... Word really can't describe it....you just have to experience it."

Love the band too!","I love going to Neyland Stadium.One year the DJ was playing so much music drowning out the band (which is what makes the game worthwhile to me).  Thankfully this year in 2015 this has stopped and I heard the band without an issue.  The atmosphere is great, everyone is so respectful: band, team, fans alike.  this all has me going back every year now."

Having grown up all my life in SE TN Neyland Stadium is a must for any game day tradition. Go early so you can visit the Hall Of Fame and listen to the pregame show.

We bought our tickets with the university so we were sat with all of our fans which is awesome. Despite the loss, everyone said that Tennessee fans were the nicest that we have experienced. Glad to say that we didn't have pee thrown on us or spat at this time. It took us forever to find Gate 10, realizing it was actually behind us. We decided to get a cabin in Pigeon Forge which just made our experience that much better. I will definitely be back at Neyland. Thank you for the amazing hospitality! Go Cocks!"

Great to see the colours. Still American sports can't generate the kind of atmospheres you experience in European stadiums. Maybe reduce the number of breaks in the game and just play the bloody game. Damn you American TV with your constant need for commercials!"

10847,Date of experience: November 2014,17-Oct-15,SEC,Tennessee,3,Expect students having too much fun.,"We went to a football game there.  Huge crowds of students and people were everywhere!  Crowds were fairly well behaved.  Were treated to the Vol Band escorting the players into the stadium  Got to our reserved seats and were a tad perplexed by some seats that had backs on them and some that did not.  Helped ourselves to the backed seats and were told that the seat owners had paid extra for them.  Please vacate. Seemed logical, so we moved.  A pair of  well oiled students had seats in the row directly in front of us.  Were loud and having a great time. Lots of leaning back against our knees and leaning dangerously in various directions.. It was a little awkward because they were louder than the stadium sound system. Obviously not interested in the game because they were talking about everything other than the game.  We learned a great deal about our new neighbors, TMI!!  Then 4 of their equally drunk friends  showed up.  No problem!  They just sat on the laps of their two friends and the two strangers who had bought the seats next to the two students.  I guess it's a good way to meet new people?  Crazy day in a beautiful and huge stadium.  Tickets were expensive.  We were glad the fun-loving students didn't want to sit on our laps."

I've taken several people for their first UT game and everyone comments about the excitement and feeling in the stadium with the number of people there.  It is a great experience, even for those who are not necessarily big football fans.  The people, lights, band, jumbotron, and crowd make it well worth your time to catch a game."

My wife and I met while in grad school at UT in the early 1980s, and our first official date was to the UT-Ole Miss game in November 1983.  We have very fond memories of Neyland Stadium.But I'm also an objective person who has attended college football games at more than 30 different stadiums across the country,  and almost all of the SEC schools.  You must go to Neyland one time in your life.  There is not a bad seat in the place, and even the nosebleed seats in the upper levels have a good view of the entire field.  Be forewarned that it can be very, very loud,  but what would you expect from 102,455 fans.....Access to Neyland can be quite difficult, but if you have a boat and can make the trip up to the docks along with the others in the Big Orange Navy it would be an amazing experience for a first-timer."
10855,Date of experience: September 2015,10-Oct-15,SEC,Tennessee,4,Great stadium,really nice place for a college football game. The white and orange checkered seats and end zones really identity the place... and of course the playing of Rockey top

SEC football is an experience in itself, but when you have a stadium that holds over 100,000 people it really gets exciting.  From the Vol Walk or watching the team come down the street, to the band, to all the tailgating and then the excitement inside...this is the place for football.  Now if the Vols team could just get on track and win games like they used to."

10860,Date of experience: September 2015,29-Sep-15,SEC,Tennessee,3,Not a nice scene walking in toilet water.,"Old and decrepit. It looks fine from the seats, but in our section during the Oklahoma game (Oklahoma side, 40 yd line, 25 rows up)  the mens room toilets were over flowing, 2 inches of water or whatever on the floor and flowing out into the walkway even into the nearest concession stand were we had bought some food earlier. Enough said!! Renovation of bathrooms and concession stands would be a major upgrade just to get even with some of the college stadiums in this country. I have been to some Division 2 and 3  stadiums that were nicer. And to get a hot dog in the third quarter, non existent, several concession stands had nothing but drinks. I talked to a few Oklahoma people after the game who were sitting in front of us and they said it was the worse stadium they had ever been to. I cannot give the exact quote. Come on Tennessee, fix up the place for all the people!"

And we were in the upper level and needed to enter in Gate 10, which was a mess. Took 40 minutes to get in. And when we were finally in, it was packed and hard to move around. What do you expect in an old stadium that seats 102,000+? Not much available for concessions, food or merchandise. But the experience was electrifying and we had a great time."

The entire college football experience at UT is one of the best. I have been to Notre Dame, Georgia, Ole Miss and others and this ranks right up there with the best. The pre-game Vol Walk, where the coaches and players walk into the stadium, followed by UT Band, The Pride of the Southland Marching Band doing the ""March to the Stadium"" and playing ""Salute to the Hill. Inside the stadium, the concessions and bathrooms are good. The lines move fast and the food selections are great. The experience of being with 100,000+ Volunteer fans at the game is out of this world!"

We were not disappointed.  It was a fabulous experience.  And thank you Tennessee for being gracious to us after an Oklahoma win.  The Big Orange showed out well."

It had great food and the staff there manages to keep it clean a running smooth, even with over 102,000 people running around! It was really something to experience attending a game here and I really enjoyed myself.

Every person we encountered during our visit was so friendly and welcoming.  We had great conversations and everyone was so ready to help us if needed.  Their enthusiasm made such a statement to us, even though our team was behind for the better part of the game.Only made one visit to the concession stand which was during the second half.  Luckily, we were able to get the last two hot dogs.  It did seem like the seats were very, very close together.  I didn't realize until after the game that there was actually an empty seat in our area which gave us a little more wiggle room, but we were very close together.  Additionally, the rows are close together.  Everyone was getting bumped in their backs by knees on the row behind them.    But, if you are a true football fan, the seating issues are not that big of a problem. Parking could have been better.  We arrived hours early to scout out parking and had to walk quite a distance.Tennessee River is by the stadium and offers good restaurants."
10869,Date of experience: September 2015,15-Sep-15,SEC,Tennessee,3,"Big stadium, but a third tier in facilities","For all the fan worship of Neyland it is a dump. Inadequate bathrooms, concourses where you cannot even move and rusty beams supporting the stands. I had a great view, but if there was in-climate weather or some even like a bomb lots of people would suffer, time for it to be modernized."
10870,Date of experience: September 2015,15-Sep-15,SEC,Tennessee,2,Came to Rocky Top and the Sooners took victory. Stadium needs repair.,"This is an old stadium and the visitors end zone was terrible. 3 bathrooms were totally stopped up. The stairs are straight up and pretty dangerous coming down. The concession area is tiny with small aisles.  Bad design.  Leaving was a nightmare. The whole end zone empties into one ramp.  If there was an emergency, this would be very dangerous.  Hope they have a renovation planned."
10871,Date of experience: September 2015,15-Sep-15,SEC,Tennessee,2,"Fabled site, but wholly inadequate in meaningful ways","This is one of those college football stadia that people want to visit because of its storied history and large size. However, we found it significantly lacking. Concessions were inadequate, as were bathroom facilities. Seating was deplorable. The bench seats throughout the biggest part of the stadium are clearly planned to fit as many people as possible, and the seats are simply too close together. We had to sit sideways to make room for our shoulders. I suspect there are provisions for the disabled, but they are not obvious and climbing to the top rows is a real chore. Exiting the stadium is a nightmare. I am sure that Vol fans love this venue, but I have been to many of the most fabled college football stadia and found this one severely lacking."
10872,Date of experience: September 2015,13-Sep-15,SEC,Tennessee,4,"Go for the Vols, not the best stadium experience","The home of the University of Tennessee football team.  Assuming you are a UT fan (I am) it is a great place to watch football.  But...None of the seat other than the upper deck on the north end have backs.  All the non seat back seats are really close together so you will be in really close quarters.The concessions here are weird.  Certain places have popcorn, other have peanuts, etc.  so that means you typically have to go to a couple places to get what you want.  This is annoying.  When you are under the upper deck (last 10-15 rows of the lower level) you cant see the jumbotron at all."
10873,Date of experience: November 2014,13-Sep-15,SEC,Tennessee,5,Football,Went here for the homecoming game and it is awesome to see. They shut the streets down and the band comes down playing Rocky Top all the way to the stadium. The game wasn't what I wanted. Tennessee lost the game. But this is a experience I will always remember.
10874,Date of experience: September 2015,13-Sep-15,SEC,Tennessee,5,OU @ UT game,"Had a great time!  Some of the stadium is older and from the upper deck you have a great view, but do not get in a rush to leave.  But once you get to the parking deck the route gets you out & off campus quickly.  The UT fans were friendly & welcoming.  We tailgated so did not eat anything but a hotdog; by the fourth quarter, folks around us said there wasn't much left to purchase for eating & we had two overtimes after that.  UT fans broke a loudness level record while we were there, up to 114, so you know the fan spirit was at fever pitch!  Lots of opportunities to sing Rocky Top!  If you love college football, do not miss an opportunity to visit Neyland Stadium in Knoxville!"
10875,Date of experience: November 2014,9-Sep-15,SEC,Tennessee,5,The VOLS play here!!!,"I have been lucky enough to attend 2 football games at Neyland, and the experience is beyond all expectations. The game day atmosphere is one that can't be beat.  It's such a special place that I have went and just sat in the parking lot across the street and looked and remembered it.  This was one of the things on my bucket list, and if none of the others get accomplished, I will still die very happy.  I still sit and think about the times and get teary eyes at all of it."
10876,Date of experience: September 2015,8-Sep-15,SEC,Tennessee,3,Could Use a Refresh,"This was our 35th FBS stadium we have visited in the past 8 years, but unfortunately will have to rank near the bottom.  We scored it a better than poor, because we weren't there for a game.  Had we been, we felt the atmosphere would have outweighed the old run down feel this stadium had."
10877,Date of experience: August 2015,20-Aug-15,SEC,Tennessee,5,Football time!!!,"The vols had a practice session where they let the fans come and watch for free. Not all teams do that.  We are HUGE vols fans and so we drove 5 1/2 hours just to see our favorite team. We had so much fun and really enjoyed the whole thing. After they were done and before they left the field, they went around the bottom of the field and high fived the fans on the bottom row. We were lucky enough to have been on the bottom row. #56 told us thank you and that they appreciated us coming out to support them. Can't wait for season to start!! #GBO"
10880,Date of experience: September 2019,4-Mar-20,SEC,Texas,5,exciting open air college football stadium,Very fun! It feels old school and you can feel the electricity within the fans! One of the stadiums that still serves beer on site.
10881,Date of experience: October 2019,25-Feb-20,SEC,Texas,5,Fabulous stadium!,"It was my first time attending a TX game at the stadium and it was fantastic! Loved everything about it...food vendors, the traditions, location of our seats (we were in the upper section, but it wasn't too high; not a bad view in the whole place), easy of finding our seats, the staff we encountered...it was everything I imagined. I hope to return soon."
10882,Date of experience: December 2018,26-Nov-19,SEC,Texas,5,Great football staduim,I love this football stadium. I have been here multiple times to watch the longhorns play and my high school has played here before. The staff is very friendly and helpful.
10883,Date of experience: November 2019,16-Nov-19,SEC,Texas,5,Terrific stadium,"We like to go the the UT Club for drinks, happy hours, or meals like lunch or dinner. The football games are major experiences with Matthew McConnaughy  (ms?) showing up at many games.It is an experience to not miss."
10884,Date of experience: September 2019,5-Nov-19,SEC,Texas,5,DKR Stadium,The stadium boasts a new (August 2019) Hall of Fame that is a sports museum deluxe.  It is located in the north end of the stadium and is open daily.
10885,Date of experience: October 2019,22-Oct-19,SEC,Texas,5,Go to the Hall of Honor,Nobody appreciates their history quite like Texans.  This is doubly true for sports history.  The Texas Athletic program has done a wonderful job with their hall of honor showcasing their program's athletes.  Their olympic display was particularly impressive.  They were smart and brought in their Heisman Trophy winner statues as well.  Overall good use of an hour if you're a Texas Fan!  Hook em' Horns!
10886,Date of experience: October 2019,20-Oct-19,SEC,Texas,4,First class experience,"Walked from our hotel to the Texas KU game and had a great time.  Lots of activities around the stadium to enjoy.  The food, games and other vendors were very fan friendly.  Entering the stadium was EASY.  There was a large crowd of people but is was very organized.  Our seats were benches but we had plenty of room to stretch out.  The passion of the Texas fans was wonderful.  Several nervous moments before a final 50 to 48 victory.  Really enjoyed the pre-game rituals.  Concession stand lines were long but moved quickly.   Most people were happy on the way out.  Most fans were polite to the KU fans."
10887,Date of experience: October 2019,13-Oct-19,SEC,Texas,5,Texas Athletics Nutrition Center (TANC) is First Class,"Great opportunity to experience a first class nutrition center for athletes, see the expansion of the stadium and meet the athletic director! And, enjoy excellent food!"
10888,Date of experience: September 2019,9-Oct-19,SEC,Texas,5,2019 Texas VS OK ST Game,"I am from NC and have gone to many Duke Football Games but been wanting to go to a Texas Football Game for a long time. I finally went on 9/21/19 when they played OK ST. It was a completely Different Atmosphere  then what I thought it was going to be. They had a few midway games there, food trucks and lot of little side stands. It was like a festival to celebrate the game. I loved it and Loved that they beat OK ST. I hope in the future I can do it again I enjoyed it so much. Also for it to be such a big stadium you can get out of there quick, I thought we would be in traffic for hours just to get out, that wasn't the case."
10889,Date of experience: September 2019,22-Sep-19,SEC,Texas,4,Very Good Football Venue,"This is a really big stadium, yet it is fairly easy to negotiate the crowds on entry and exit, and while at the stadium. Long, slow moving lines at times for food and beverages. Easy in and out of the men??s room. Food is okay, typical stadium stuff, but beer is served; and a food court area downstairs outside the north end zone has a variety of name brand fast food, coffee, and some local/less large franchise offerings. Parking close without a parking pass isn??t possible, but lots of parking 1/2 mile or so from the entrance for approx $20. I prefer to Uber to the stadium (about 1/8 mile from entrance on East side, and then walk to Buenos Aires Restaurant (north of stadium approx 1/2 mile) for an Uber home. Lots of tickets available from scalpers outside the stadium, and usually easy to get 1-2 tickets for $50/each (and sometimes much less) from nice fans that have extra tickets. East side is the sunny side for day games. Come prepared for sun or you will really burn. Importantly, no obstructed views. Sit at or above row 30 in the lower level. Large, high quality screen in the south end zone adds to the game experience. Hook ?? em!"
10890,Date of experience: September 2019,10-Sep-19,SEC,Texas,4,very nice facility and atmosphere,"this was a very good football facility; clean restrooms, nice concourses, great atmosphere, good acoustics for PA.  The only thing that is to have more Tiger fans and less Horn fans."
10891,Date of experience: September 2019,3-Sep-19,SEC,Texas,4,Longhorns game was quite the event,"I??ve never been to an American football game before this one, it did not disappoint. Stadium was huge, the energy was sky-High throughout the game. The half-time show with the band was really cool. It was damn hot though and I??m pregnant so I couldn??t drink alcohol, it was still really cool to see. We didn??t stay the whole game, I was getting uncomfortable on the bleachers. It was Definitely worth doing"

10893,Date of experience: November 2018,26-Aug-19,SEC,Texas,5,Big Time College Football,"If you want to experience big time college football, this is the place. It doesn't get much more boiserous than a Saturday Texas Longhorn game. Have a drink, get into the spirit and enjoy. Hook 'em Horns."
10894,Date of experience: August 2018,11-Jul-19,SEC,Texas,4,Decent Facility,"Nice football facility. It is the third best in the state behind Kyle Field & AT&T Stadium. It seats 100,000+, but never has that many attend games."
10897,Date of experience: December 2018,31-Mar-19,SEC,Texas,3,Not a comfortable stadium,I have been to many games and other events  at this stadium. It is not a very good place to view an event. And parking is not good either.
10898,Date of experience: November 2018,27-Feb-19,SEC,Texas,5,Longhorns Football season 2018,Great seats - good variety of food choices. New beer selection is available at different locations across the entire stadium and the beer guys serve beer in cans at your seat. Longhorn games are more exciting with Coach Herman.
10899,Date of experience: September 2018,20-Feb-19,SEC,Texas,5,UT Football,Great venue to watch the awesome Texas Longhorns football team!  The stadium has lots of food options and provides a great atmosphere to cheer on the Horns!
10900,Date of experience: November 2018,26-Nov-18,SEC,Texas,5,Exciting Game Day,"My first game. This stadium is huge, easy find concessions and gifts. A little walk if you take the bus, but beats trying to park."
10901,Date of experience: November 2018,12-Nov-18,SEC,Texas,4,WVU vs UT football game,Enjoyed my first trip to the stadium. Being a WVU fan it was very enjoyable since we won the game. Thought the stadium was very nice and clean with a lot of food options. Only complaint would be the way they have section 25 and 26 laid out. It's one section that they split into two even though there is no line of demarcation. So the number can get confusing for people.
10902,Date of experience: November 2018,12-Nov-18,SEC,Texas,5,Football at DKR-Texas Memorial Stadium,"We attend all the home football games at UT and got there regularly. Great venue for football. Food is OK, with quite a few choices."
10903,Date of experience: November 2018,4-Nov-18,SEC,Texas,5,Great Football Atmosphere,"This is great place to attend a football game.  The history of the stadium, the traditions, and football makes this a great place.  No matter if you are a first timer or a veteran.  Every experience is remarkable."
10904,Date of experience: November 2018,4-Nov-18,SEC,Texas,5,Fantastic football experience,"We drove in from Dallas for the day, 3 hour drive and it was completely worth it. Great stadium, views, concessions, everything was a great. Highly recommend for a college football experience."
10905,Date of experience: October 2018,18-Oct-18,SEC,Texas,5,Great football experience!,"The atmosphere is super fun with Bevo Blvd., the Longhorn Band and exciting football.  Can't be beat!!"
10906,Date of experience: October 2018,14-Oct-18,SEC,Texas,5,Home of the longhorns!,My very first football game and I loved it. The atmosphere was just amazing - the passion and the energy around the stadium was electric. The home team Texas Longhorns won the match and it was the icing on the cake. Though the opponents were not a strong team but the match was close. Definitely going for another match when possible.
10907,Date of experience: September 2018,2-Oct-18,SEC,Texas,5,Bevo Blvd is new and a fun place to tailgate before watching the Longhorns game,"New addition the the gameday experience at DKR Texas Memorial Stadium is the street party on San Jacinto west of the stadium. Live Music, Food trucks, cold beverages which starts 5 hours before kickoff.Watch the Longhorn Band march down the street with Bevo to follow and the Texas Longhorn football team in the countdown to the big game.Lots of family friendly activities for the Longhorn faithful and their guests.Come Early and watch the pregame shows.It is free admission to the public and no ticket required."
10909,Date of experience: September 2018,22-Sep-18,SEC,Texas,5,Better experience,"If you live in Austin, or you are a UT alumn, or only like football, do not miss the new football experience at Darrel K Royal Stadium. Try not to miss the tailgate on Bevo Blvd, and the new ACL on campus on the LBJ lawn. fully recommendt. Lots of fun, food and drinks, and of course, Texas Football"
10910,Date of experience: September 2018,20-Sep-18,SEC,Texas,2,Supersize High School Stadium,"If you are planning on attending an function at the DKRT Stadium, be warned, you will be sitting on High School-style bleachers. And it's almost worse because the seating is SO tight and cramped. Oh and when you're ready to leave, there are no more cushy escalators to get you back down to the ground, which were broken by the way and had NO AC. You are stuck walking down this extremely dodgy back ramp that makes you feel like a bull in a cattle corral. This ramp is filled with cockroach-looking crickets and smoke-filled pockets! Oh and if you have any peanut allergies, stay away or you will end up hospitalized. EVERYONE eats peanuts the entire time and no one cares about your ""allergy,"" not even the staff. I expressed the allergy concern in my party to the staff and they all shrugged their shoulders and let us know we could certainly leave. Thanks for the hospitality Texas!"
10911,Date of experience: September 2018,19-Sep-18,SEC,Texas,5,Hook 'Em,Great place to watch a football game.  Seats have armrests and chair backs.  Good sight lines even from the goal line area.  Expanded concessions are more than normal stadium fare.  Great college atmosphere.
10912,Date of experience: September 2018,18-Sep-18,SEC,Texas,5,Texas Longhorns Football.,"Nothing better than watching Texas Longhorns at DKR STADIUM ON A COOL FALL NIGHT. The bands, the action and the fans."
10913,Date of experience: September 2018,17-Sep-18,SEC,Texas,5,Had a great night out.,We went to watch the Texas Longhorns. The football itself was hard to see - so far away - but it was a really great night out.
10914,Date of experience: September 2018,16-Sep-18,SEC,Texas,3,Still Bench Seating,"The stadium has undergone many renovations over the years but 90% of the seats are still bench seating which makes for the old fashioned crowded stadium seating, although you can rent stadium cushions for $10 each to at least cushion it a little.  Bathrooms clean, and oddly, there were longer lines for the mens room!  Good and friendly security provided the stadium. Standard stadium food: hotdogs, popcorn etc, but get it before you sit down because there are no vendors coming through the isle.  They sell beer which unfortunately makes for some debatable teenage behavior as the day wears on.   Scoreboard very slow, maybe that was just this one event, but it was annoying how long it took to update, and there is only one scoreboard and it is on the south.  If you don't have a seat that faces south, I hope you can see the field because the scoreboard is pretty useless,so just keep that in mind when you buy tickets.  The sound system was good, although the music that was played was so heavy with bass you had to wonder what kind of event you were attending!  There is a shared ride lot that is about 15-20 min walk from the stadium (Lot 40).  There are a couple of motels that are within a 30 min walk from the stadium and it is a safe walk.  Clear bag policy and NO UMBRELLAS.  On the way out we saw a table that had a lot of umbrellas that people had to leave behind.  All in all it wasn't too bad, just a little behind the times in todays football  stadium world but we understand it is not too easy to remodel when you are locked into that spot on campus."
10915,Date of experience: August 2018,18-Aug-18,SEC,Texas,5,"Dinner in stadium at The University of Texas Club.  Steak and Lobster, EXCELLENT!","Food was fabulous.  Two couples.  Three of us had the surf and turf, which was excellent, and came with garlic mashers, and variety of miniature vegeggies.  The fourth person had short ribs, which were a bit dry.  The salad was also excellent.  For dessert, 2 had chocolate cake, and I had super peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream."
10916,Date of experience: November 2017,6-Aug-18,SEC,Texas,5,scalp the scalpers,"If you are a big UT fan, this a must. The HUGE stadium is mind boggling..lately, with the football team being less than stellar, if you wait til kick off you can buy tickets from scalpers..in a sense, you can scalp the scalpers..with games running well over three hours, waiting five minutes til after kick off is a smart buy...print off a map of the seating arrangement inside, and pick the best ticket for the best price..hmmm that was deep, but you will have a choice, unless Texas has returned to top ten territory, then you might have to get a second mortgage to buy a ticket...but I digress..  Its an amazing experience, the score board, the pageantry...check it out!!"
10922,Date of experience: November 2017,4-Apr-18,SEC,Texas,3,Age is showing,"They ran out of food at most concessions at the half.  It's still a great stadium to hold 100K people, but the age is showing and the winding and weaving to get to each concession is difficult for seniors or those with walking issues.  But tough to complain overall when it's historic and home of the Horns!"
10924,Date of experience: November 2017,4-Feb-18,SEC,Texas,3,Football Mecca,If College Football is your religion then a visit to Memorial Stadium is mandatory. Make sure the Longhorns are playing a game for full effect.
10925,Date of experience: October 2017,21-Jan-18,SEC,Texas,5,World Class Football Stadium,"If you are in Austin during the fall on a weekend when the Longhorns are playing at home, do not miss this. Since the stadium seats 100,000, there are always reasonably priced tickets available before the game on the street."
10926,Date of experience: October 2017,7-Jan-18,SEC,Texas,5,more wins please,The facility is now world class. The addition of beer has made the deal complete.Now could we never LOSE again here!
10927,Date of experience: November 2017,14-Dec-17,SEC,Texas,5,GO EARLY,"I've been going to Texas football games for the last 44 years.  This is an iconic stadium with pretty great views wherever you choose to sit.  Parking in Austin continues to be a major problem and especially on game day. I would avoid doing anything on I-35 and or coming in from the downtown area.  I've found the best route to the stadium is coming in from N. Lamar BLVD and heading onto W. Guadalupe and then right into the Adams Park area. If you get lucky sometimes you can find a side street parking spot. The 8th graders at Kirby Hall School (off of W 29th street) will allow you to park for 20 dollars (it used to be 10 until halfway through this year) but it goes to a good cause, or so I'm told. It's about a 15 min walk to the stadium.  Make sure you go to the right gate as stated on your ticket....the walk around the stadium can be difficult but if you go to your gate you should be fine. While I don't drink at the games, plenty of people do. U Texas fans consumed the most alcohol of any stadium (but it could be the play of the team as of late) but vendors get out to the people and stop serving at the start of the 4th quarter.  If you want to see the band they still gather at the fountain (no longer working) and play before they march into the stadium. Halftime is always worth watching as the ShowBand of the Southwest has been the best attraction as of late.  Been to many college stadiums throughout the country and I would describe the experience as quite family friendly and people are mostly polite and helpful.  If you have not been on the UT campus it's worth walking around The Drag and getting a sense of the 40 Acres. Perhaps you might get lucky and even see a good game. Hook'Em."
10928,Date of experience: November 2017,9-Dec-17,SEC,Texas,5,Outstanding Stadium and event!,I was fortunate to attend the Veterans Day game against Kansas.  The stadium is already a showpiece with the number of veteran memorials throughout the stadium but to be there on Veterans Day was epic!  The staff and fans were amazing.  Like all stadiums the food and beer was overpriced but the food was good!
10929,Date of experience: September 2017,9-Dec-17,SEC,Texas,4,Earl still hurting,"Remember when Notre Dame made Heisman Trophy Winner, Earl Campbell cry?  I sure do.  That was awesome!"
10930,Date of experience: November 2017,26-Nov-17,SEC,Texas,5,a great place to watch football,"A real nice venue to watch a college football game. Not only is the stadium large, but there is also a large screen tv above the field to watch plays. Unless you are a BIG booster be prepared to park several blocks to a mile away. But that is par with any university on game day. Beer and wine now for sale. Better to go to a night game over a day game as it does get warm sitting in the stands. Good experience."
10931,Date of experience: November 2017,25-Nov-17,SEC,Texas,5,Great football venue,"We visited the DKR Stadium for a UT/Texas Tech game this year.  The stadium is large but the large screen makes it seem smaller. We had seats in the end zone and it was still a fine spot to watch the game.  If you go, parking is a challenge.  Be prepared to pay $25 to park- cheaper parking may be available 5-6 blocks away but you have to look.  Maybe use a parking app to find the best deals."
10932,Date of experience: November 2017,15-Nov-17,SEC,Texas,5,One of the better large capacity college stadiums,"My wife and I attended the UT-Kansas game on November 11, 2017. It's been awhile since we went to a game, but we planned ahead and got good seats at a reasonable price (Section 3, Row 60, 20 yd line, lower deck west side section). The view was great and you could see the game in real-time and then turn to the jumbotron for the replay. I would definitely try and get lower level seating, but the lower rows of the upper deck are also nice. We parked at the Dell Medical Center parking garage on 16th and Trinity for $25, so we only had about a five block walk to the game through the heart of the tailgaters. Beer and wine are now for sale in the stadium and the restrooms were not overly crowded and fairly convenient. Seats are comfortable and you can upgrade with cushions provided by DKR or bring your own. This was an evening game, so the sun was not issue. If you're going to an afternoon game early in the season, be aware that it gets HOT in the stadium and the lower deck west side higher rows offer shade as the day progresses. All in all, we had a nice time and UT got a win!"
10933,Date of experience: November 2017,13-Nov-17,SEC,Texas,4,Great stadium!,Been here a few times and there are no bad sight lines for the game. The giant screen above Joe Jamal Field provide a good replay and live play vantage point. The free water stations were a major plus. The negative is the long walk concourse to the 3rd level seating. There are no easy ways to get all the way up and down and after knee surgery it was a trek. Decent prices but a great atmosphere.
10934,Date of experience: November 2017,12-Nov-17,SEC,Texas,5,Great football venue,Attended multiple football games over the years. The stadium can be loud at times. The concessions have multiple food and beer options. The seats can be a little tight in places. Parking is ok if you have a parking pass.
10935,Date of experience: November 2017,12-Nov-17,SEC,Texas,5,Always a show at DKR- Memorial Stadium.,"Though it??s always more fun when the Texas Longhorns win, the athletic department always makes sure that there is a show for the fans. For this Veteran??s Day, the Golden Eagles parachuted into the stadium, there was a flyover by four F-15??s, the band played Sousa marches with all sorts of flying banners and finally the most incredible fireworks display I??ve ever seen. This was all on top of the normal Fight songs, cheerleader efforts, t-shirt canon shots, etc. that go on at every game. It was really fun."
10936,Date of experience: October 2017,7-Nov-17,SEC,Texas,4,"It's Texas, It's Got To Be Big","Attended the 2017 Texas v Oklahoma State football game in Austin with 92,505 of my closest friends. Was immediately impressed by the shear size of Darrell Royal Stadium. Although we were seated in the upper deck, the view was good and the weather was outstanding for late October. It's a challenge walking up the endless ramps to the upper deck, however, we found out after the fact that there are public elevators that access the top levels. In that the stadium is located in the downtown Austin area, parking is an issue. instead of hunting down a spot we took an UBER from our hotel to the game. Worked out great. All in all, it was an enjoyable experience."
10937,Date of experience: September 2017,18-Oct-17,SEC,Texas,4,Great fan-friendly place to see a game,"Over the years the stadium and it's offerings have only improved.  Logistically, it's much easier to get around than it used to.  The food and drink changes have been revolutionary vs. traditional standard fare.  The only negative is the PA used to actually call a game while now it's used for WAY to loud commercials!"
10938,Date of experience: October 2017,11-Oct-17,SEC,Texas,5,The largest football stadium I have ever been to,Well maintained and located in the heart of University of Texas.  Lots of fun shops and a quick walk from the LBJ Library.
10939,Date of experience: September 2017,2-Oct-17,SEC,Texas,5,The Center of University of Texas Life,"This is where the foot ball games happen in fall, but anyone can jog around the track during lunch.  Don't miss."
10940,Date of experience: September 2017,6-Sep-17,SEC,Texas,4,Go Longhorns!,"We have season football tickets so are familiar with it. Food okay, Drinks costly, Free cups of water now. Very crowded on game day, but still fairly clean in bathrooms and concession area."

For perspective, this stadium can hold 30,000 more people than the Houston Texans stadium - just incredible.  Pro Tip: bring plenty of sunscreen - there is no shade and you will be sitting in the open sun for hours."

10952,Date of experience: November 2016,13-Nov-16,SEC,Texas,3,Decent stadium,Here for a West Virginia game. All the normal amenities including alcohol. Pricing was high as expected at most stadiums. The bathrooms were clean. Biggest issue was the lack of shading pretty much with all seating. Couldn't imagine what it would be like early in the season.
10953,Date of experience: October 2016,9-Nov-16,SEC,Texas,5,Great atmosphere,What can I say but wow what a stadium huge band playing two sets of cheerleaders and Cowboys with Old smoky cannon letting it off at every score and even got to see the tower light up after the game as The Longhorns won brilliant

But what's always consistent is the pageantry of the game day experience. From Ol' Smokey blasting off after each score to Big Bertha counting off the number of points scored to the Cheerleaders dancing to the Wabash Cannonball, excitement is built up in the stadium. The star attraction, of course, is the Showband of the Southwest. Their precision marching along with their wonderful sound is unsurpassed by any other band in the nation. The stadium fills early to watch them enter and fans stay in their seats at halftime to see them perform. Something new is always being added. Now fireworks go off during the National Anthem and after each score. More local vendors are selling their wares and beer is available. See you at the next game and Hook 'em."

DKR is a fabulous place to see a college football game, even if you're not a football fan. The whole experience is something like a theme park??getting to the stadium, the sea of burnt orange, the cannon fire, the marching band, the fireworks... it was just so much fun. And there's not a bad seat in the house!If I had a complaint, I'd be that there needs to be better/more handicapped access to the upper decks. We had someone with us who was having a hard time towards the end of the game and she didn't quite know what to do to get to the bottom of the ramp. Other than that, it was fantastic!"

It's design is eye catching, magnificent, functional, spacious and convenient.  All concession areas are brick and mortar.  They are located everywhere on all levels.  Each concession area has unique food.  One may have BBQ while another may have pizzas and yet another may have sandwiches.   Some serve Italian food while others serve burgers.  There some with vegetarian food while others serve brats.  The list goes on and on.  Many years ago Starbucks settled in one are and have been there ever since. There is a food court the size of two football fields in the north concourse.  There are foods, drinks, souvenir vendors along with activities for fans including kids.  Still, there is plenty of open space in the concourse for kids to play indoor football....yes it's that BIG!They even serve beer and wine for adults. All this while you're watching The University of Texas Longhorn football team play.  The Show Band of the Southwest the Longhorn Band also puts on a fantastic show before every game and at halftime.

Also, food is not great at subway so don't even bother."
10974,Date of experience: September 2016,5-Sep-16,SEC,Texas,5,Great game!!!,"So much fun for a game.  If you are a favor college football - this is a bucket list item!  Go early and be sure to head north of the stadium to watch the band line up and march through campus (about 45 min before the game starts).  In the north end of the stadium there are great food choices including lots of local choices.  It's worth a visit to the north end for food since it's not your typical stadium food. They offer free water areas.  Look for the very large blue water jugs with free cups. Seat hint - sections 1-7 and 101-107 are on the shady side for late afternoon early evening games.  It can be hot so it's worth trying to sit there. Another hint - save so money and get the upper deck in the first 17 rows.  Section 101-107 offers all folding seat backs. Very nice and no ""seat encroachment"" from neighbors."

The result was a magnificent stadium with modern infrastructure and facilities.  No, this was not 2 years ago.  No, not 5 years ago when many schools were planning to upgrade.  The answer is over 10 years ago UT finished a renovation project that set the standard for other schools to follow. Giant food court....check.  Enormous indoor seating with sofas and chairs....check.

There was a time when it was collegiate, relaxed, wholesome and fun. Today, the grounds around the stadium are strewn with clusters of obnoxious drunks ""tailgating"". This activity is primitive and unseemly. On top of that the UT alums run everything. They expanded the stadium to accommodate their need for club boxes as if the venue was their personal possession. By blocking in the northern part of the stadium the breeze is gone. That means any game over 80 degrees will seem much hotter when 90000 fans are in the stands. To cap off all of this ""progress"" the geniuses at UT decided to sell alcohol in the stadium. If you don't get enough of drunks outside you can sit next to them during the game. The students and band have been relegated to the south end zone as if they don't matter, just so the alums can have more seats. Really sad??.sad??.sad"

""Fight!"", to the choices of food.  They were literally overwhelmed and struggled to put their ""feelings"" into words.  Their experience was also consistent with another guest of ours who was from France.  She had never seen a U.S. football game before.  20-minutes inside of DKR and she said, ""I get what all the excitement is about!""  If you want a truly great football experience make the time and effort to attend a game in DKR!"

I have never been in a stadium this big for a college football game.  I attended the California/Texas game and was amazed by the sheer size of the stadium.  This is a great place to view a football game, the many promotions and sideline events will have you thinking you are in attendance at a professional sporting event.  The sound system is pretty horrible, for a stadium that holds over 100,000 people, it has a tinny sound system that only broadcasts from one end zone.  The day before the game I visited the stadium and the museum of the Texas greats is pretty impressive too!"
11004,Date of experience: September 2015,6-Oct-15,SEC,Texas,4,Its big...not better,"Its big, and a bit confusing for a first time visitor.  The different levels make it hard to get oriented.  Despite the  large capacity, it didn't seem as loud as some other stadiums we've been in (maybe the play of the team had something to do with that).  Many features are a bit dated nowadays - smallish video board, cramped seats.  Food choices were typical stadium fare.  Did not care for the fact that beer vendors were everywhere, and there seemed to be few controls on consumption.  The band was excellent, however."

This stadium is named after one of the most successful coaches in UT history, Darrel K. Royal and has bronze statues of some of the key players in the football program over the years as well as Royal.

From the outside structure you can tell nothing cheap was put into this stadium. Even if you are not a Longhorn fan but are in the area I think you should take some time to check out how beautiful this stadium really is.

This monster stadium and improvements were made over 10 years ago and before most other schools decided to,upgrade their facility twice (sorry Aggies).

It is worth waiting to watch. The jumbo screen is really large and entertaining. I found myself watching many of the plays on it instead of the field. Be prepared for it to be VERY loud at times (we were in Sec. 116).  I had been advised to bring ear plugs and I wore them. The benches were too narrow with insufficient leg room. That was a real disappointment. Be advised to bring a pad or stadium seat-back.  Also, at least near my seats, concessions were limited. They were selling Australian meat pies, Subway pre-made 6"" sandwiches and there was a Starbucks store...no hot dogs, burgers, etc.  Also there is no alcohol served.On a very positive note, the UT fans were all cordial and friendly to we visitors...true Texas hospitality."
11029,Date of experience: September 2013,29-Aug-14,SEC,Texas,5,ENJOY THIS FOOTBALL VENUE MORE THAN ANY OTHER!,"I have been to other college football games in the Southeast/South Atlantic and the Rocky Mountain Region as well as NFL games at Mile High, Jerry??s World and even the Metrodome in Minneapolis but a Longhorn game at Darrell Royal ?? Texas Memorial Stadium at the University of Texas is the best football experience I have enjoyed. A very large and great  football stadium, good views of the field, greatest fans on earth, tradition, impressive pre-game/ half time/post-game activities and traditions, perfect late September Austin evening, beautiful sunset to the west, and to top it off: a Texas victory over Kansas State. I only lived down in Texas for four years but this venue really stirs up my Texas loyalty. HOOK EM HORNS!!"
11030,Date of experience: November 2013,18-Nov-13,SEC,Texas,4,UT History Inside!,"Memorabilia and UT history can be found inside at the UT Club entrance. UT Club is a private, members only club and is located inside the stadium. Enter from the Robert Dedman side entrance - there is an awning that says ""UT Club"" and take a walk down memory lane! Located on first floor and free admission."
11032,Date of experience: September 2013,21-Sep-13,SEC,Texas,4,great facility,"beautiful stadium, impressed by its size its huge!  ramps and stairs are easy to find, but LOTS of walking.  we were in section 7 row 62, and the steps up nearly killed this outa shape lady lol.  Great view, megatron is HD and very easy to see.  I found myself watching plays on that.  Bathrooms are very outdated, was surprised.  Overall, great stadium."
11033,Date of experience: August 2013,13-Sep-13,SEC,Texas,5,So much fun!,We went to the Texas Longhorn's opening game. We sat in section 1 and had great seats. We were close to the band and huge screen!
11034,Date of experience: September 2013,1-Sep-13,SEC,Texas,4,Football Junkies Must Visit,"Simply put, forget the football game if you are not a Texas Fan.. The pageantry and tradition of being in that place is one of lifes great experiences. The passion that the fans have rivals that of any football town in America. Do yourself a favor and go check out a game!"
11036,Date of experience: November 2012,9-Dec-12,SEC,Texas,5,Love Football!,"This is one of the biggest stadiums in the country -- all the rage of Football and its only College!   Football is a religion in this state and seeing the stadium is great if you can be a part of the action. Even if just visiting, the history of Bevo the mascot is great. Even if you are not a fan, sometimes you just can't help buying a little longhorn to go with you."
11038,Date of experience: September 2012,1-Oct-12,SEC,Texas,5,Just excellent.,"One of the best gameday experiences in the nation. Texas fan party right, and treat opposing fans in a very cordial manner. Most people who visit can't wait to come back."
11039,Date of experience: September 2012,18-Sep-12,SEC,Texas,5,Nice rennovations!,"Longhorn football!!  Just be wary of going during early morning games or on very hot days.  The majority of the stadium faces east, which makes it nice for late afternoon and evening games.  Added lots of new box seats and options in the north end zone."
11040,Date of experience: October 2011,18-Aug-12,SEC,Texas,1,Football,"Fans were arrogant and actually obnoxious.  If you are the visiting team, wear a neutral shirt or be prepared to have drinks poured on you.  Worst fans I've ever been around."
11043,Date of experience: November 2011,6-May-12,SEC,Texas,5,Home of the Longhorns!  Great stadium,"Always great games, friendly tailgating and the best fans ever.  If you are into college football, you need to attend a Longhorn game.  This is your mecca!"
11055,Date of experience: October 2011,15-Jan-12,SEC,Texas,5,Watch a game at DKR,"Great traditions. Texas band is best in college football (in my personal opinion) and Texas has its own cannon they shoot off at the games. Stadium holds over 100,000 people and there's nothing like the godzillatron. Definitely catch a game here if you can!"
11056,Date of experience: October 2011,2-Jan-12,SEC,Texas,5,Worth the Visit- Although Texas Lost to UCLA 34-12,We went here for Texas' 4th game of the season back in 2010. Its a pretty cool stadium. It has all you want in it and the food is good. The bad part is that you can't go in when a game's not being played.
11058,Date of experience: November 2011,28-Nov-11,SEC,Texas,5,Texas Longhorn Football,"On home football game days the area around the stadium is turned into a huge party!  Tailgaters of every size, a sea of burnt orange, the smell of smoking BBQ and the cheers of the crowd as Texas scores!  Getting a ticket can be pretty easy if you don't mind parting with some $$$ hang out in front of Sholtz Garten and you'll see tickets for sale.On non game days there is a tour of the stadium where I believe you get to see the locker room and go up into a suite.  There are also two stores, Longhorn LTD, one on each side of the stadium to visit and buy all things Longhorns.The stadium also has, what was once the largest video scoreboard in the world.  A great place to spend a Saturday with 101,000 of your closest Longhorn friends!"
11059,Date of experience: September 2011,12-Sep-11,SEC,Texas,4,Big Stadium.  Avoid South Corner.,"The stadium was great.  The big screen at west end-zone is super.  We were visiting fans and sat in South-east corner and the sun sizzled us pretty good for about 1.5 hours.  The other parts of the stadium had shade much earlier.  Best seating is on north side - to the right of the big screen.Big hot dog had been pre-cooked (semi) and stuck to the bun.  Yuck.  Drinks were good.  Lots of Texas gear.  Also if you are on upper-upper deck, be prepared for a long and tall hike.  10 levels high.  That is a lot of switch backs.  There is even a medical tent up there and you would feel bad for the old folks here, even though I'm sure there is an elevator around somewhere."
11065,Date of experience: November 2022,27-Nov-22,SEC,Texas,5,Great football venue,Largest capacity stadium in the SEC. Great additions and upgrades since we were last here 12 years ago (thank SEC scheduling for that). Terrific game day experience - wish my school would play here more often.
11066,Date of experience: September 2022,18-Sep-22,SEC,Texas,3,Great stadium,"Fantastic first time experience of a college football  game. Wonderful experience and game as the Aggies won, sadly letdown by the PA system that was completely inaudible from our seats in section 317"
11067,Date of experience: October 2021,5-Sep-22,SEC,Texas,5,Awesome College football experience,"Pretty much all seats are great, even high ones and those in the corners.  Be sure to go to Midnight Yell Practice the night before the game!"
11068,Date of experience: September 2021,23-Aug-22,SEC,Texas,5,HOLY COW,"I have never been to any real sport games, but sitting in Kyle Field, during the game, was un-real! The energy in Kyle is something you can't really explain. Except HOLY COW"

11072,Date of experience: September 2021,22-Sep-21,SEC,Texas,5,A Gorgeous Stadium Full of Energy and School Spirit,"This stadium takes football to a whole new level. It's nicer than any professional stadium we've ever been to and holds over 100,000 spirited Aggie fans. We came to town for the weekend and enjoyed watching the Ags win 34-0. Loved sitting right behind the head Yell Leader as he led the crowd in coordinated yells. School spirit shines strong here, and it's loud and boisterous just like college football should be. Don't miss the flyover at the beginning of the game and the Aggie band performing at halftime. I've never seen anything so well coordinated and precise. They allow you to bring a bottle of water in with you; take advantage of that because it can get brutally hot inside the stadium. Don't forget sunglasses and sunscreen too. A clear bag policy is in place. Concessions are available inside and outside the stadium. Fans are extremely friendly. Highly recommend attending a game for anyone who loves football."
11074,Date of experience: November 2020,10-May-21,SEC,Texas,5,Whoop!,"Best college football stadium in the nation!  Opposing teams hate playing here because the Aggies are so loud on their coordinated yells.  And they are yells, not cheers.  Have to see it in person to understand it."
11076,Date of experience: September 2019,7-Mar-20,SEC,Texas,5,Best football stadium,I love watching Aggie football here. This is a great location. I love this stadium. This is a nice stadium.
11078,Date of experience: October 2019,2-Mar-20,SEC,Texas,5,Kyle Field is THE stadium to be for an exciting football experience!,"We have been attending Texas A&M football games at Kyle Field since 1987.  The stadium has grown a lot since then and offers a fantastic game day atmosphere and experience for all ages.  Kyle Field is now the largest football stadium in all of Texas.  Before each game, there are activities and food options outside the stadium.  Inside the stadium, a guest can relish the experience of over 102,000 fans cheering on their teams!   The Texas A&M Yell Leaders lead the students in unified yells and the Aggie War Hymn, and it is a sight to behold!"
11079,Date of experience: October 2019,11-Feb-20,SEC,Texas,5,Whoop It Up in Aggieland,We have been season ticket holders for eight years.  Kyle Field offers a memorable college game day experience.  There are great places to tailgate or food trucks outside the venue.  For kids there are bounce house and other activities. You can view other college games on game day from the Memorial Student Center or the Former Students Association building where there is food and beverage service and a giant screen television. The Slovacek??s sausage inside the stadium is our favorite. The whole game day experience is fantastic!
11080,Date of experience: October 2019,11-Dec-19,SEC,Texas,5,Amazing venue and even better environment,"What a stadium! Such a college football experience. Seats in alumni section gave us access to finer dining option which was outstanding. Honestly better than Cowboys stadium in Dallas. Students are so welcoming and thoughtful. Proximity to central campus, and northgate dining is extremely convenient."
11081,Date of experience: October 2019,26-Nov-19,SEC,Texas,5,Beat Stadium in Texas,Kyle Field is the best Stadium in Texas.  Great sight lines.  Huge screen to help see things closeup.  Food needs help.
11082,Date of experience: November 2019,25-Nov-19,SEC,Texas,5,Impressive,It is very large and easy to get to. Adequate parking and no way that you can miss seeing it if you are unfamiliar with the area.
11083,Date of experience: November 2019,17-Nov-19,SEC,Texas,5,AMAZING halftime show,"The facility is quite impressive. Well thought out, well laid out and easy to get in and out. The only downside was when the concessions ran out of food before halftime. Somewhat of a surprise, but it is what it is. The halftime show was world class. Absolutely amazing. The marching band was spot on and made some absolutely amazing maneuvers. Without missing a beat. You have to see it to believe it."
11084,Date of experience: November 2019,11-Nov-19,SEC,Texas,5,Kyle Field,The stadium is amazing but don't miss the hall of fame. The whole feeling of Kyle Field is an experience that I will not soon forget. Go there for a Texas A & M game and see the great pageantry and tradition that is a part of the University.  Gig 'em
11085,Date of experience: November 2019,4-Nov-19,SEC,Texas,5,Aggies vs UTSA,"Awesome experience and even better game! The Stadium is clean , friendly , and the people were friendly."
11086,Date of experience: November 2019,4-Nov-19,SEC,Texas,5,great fun!,First time attending a football game in ~20 years so first time seeing up close the rebuilt/larger Kyle Field.  Layout/staff/experience was all excellent!  Helpful notes:-concession lines are LONG so be prepared to wait (I think some more $$ could be made if they open up more lines/locations)!-bring stadium chairs otherwise you will be cold/hot/uncomfortable on the steel bleacher seats w/ concrete backrests-do not go wait in concession lines at halftime...make sure you see the Aggie band perform...always a highlight of the game!-during game appears bathrooms not maintained so by end of game bathroom near us out of hand towels so be prepared
11087,Date of experience: October 2019,25-Oct-19,SEC,Texas,5,Amazing experience,If you have never been to an Aggie game you need to go! I don??t care if you are a fan or not. The traditions and customs are generations deep and the atmosphere is like nowhere else.
11088,Date of experience: October 2019,21-Oct-19,SEC,Texas,5,NFL Quality at the College Level,"There are not enough positive words I can write to give this venu its due. I have been to many NFL newly built stadiums and Kyle field is on the same level. Starting with the ease to access the entry process, wide-open concourses, plenty of ramp space and even an escalator to reach upper levels. There is numerous bathrooms and concessions. Clean and well-lit plenty of space. This is 5 star."
11089,Date of experience: September 2019,14-Oct-19,SEC,Texas,5,Great venue and amazing traditions,"Kyle Field is one of the premier US college football stadiums and when packed full of rabid Aggies it creates an unforgettable game day experience.  Each game begins with the 68 Cadet Corps units marching into and around the stadium in full dress gear.  The four male Yell Leaders (A&M does not have cheerleaders!) lead the crowd in a variety of 'yells' throughout the game, each of which is signalled through a series of arm motions.  The most impressive is the Aggie War Hymn (really an anti Texas Longhorns song) which is sung full throated by the crowd and includes the famous 'saw off' (US Today claims the Way Hymn the top college fight song in America).  Be sure to watch the Cadet Corps Band at halftime as they perform incredible formations on the field while playing a variety of musical pieces.  The stadium is easy to get into and out of (the large ramps at each end are your best bets) and there are cooling rooms on each level - essential on hot September game days!  Outside the stadium you'll find a number of interesting statues as well as the Reveille graveyard - the resting place for the Texas A&M dog mascot.  It includes a mini-scoreboard so the dogs can keep an eye on each game."
11090,Date of experience: September 2019,5-Oct-19,SEC,Texas,5,Great Stadium,I love Kyle Field it is such a pretty football stadium. I love the Aggie band and revile. I would highly recommend to anyone that likes Texas A&m.
11091,Date of experience: September 2019,2-Oct-19,SEC,Texas,5,Aggies vs Cardinals,I hadn??t been here in 7 years and was really impressed with the Stadium upgrades. The campus does a good job of spreading parking out and providing shuttles to get to the field. It was an electric atmosphere even though they were playing an FCS opponent and the Aggie Band does a great job along with the Yell Leaders. A one of kind experience no matter who your cheering for
11092,Date of experience: September 2019,29-Sep-19,SEC,Texas,4,Family friendly atmosphere,"We've gone to three games this year and from that -Pros: The tailgating area is very lively, friendly and entertaining.  I went to UT and still felt welcomed. The yell practice and march in is something every Aggie should see first hand.The staff, including their security were very friendly and accommodating The Zone is a nice, comfortable area. The food offerings were good even for a vegetarian. Plug ins for charging are around the side and the restrooms were clean with no wait. There are several Artic Cool Zones around the stadium with a varied food offerings different from the corridor vendors. Those were nice at the beginning of the game but by the middle, the same temp as the rest of the stadium due to people leaving the doors open.Cons: The stadium is confusing to navigate and elevators are few and far between if you can't take the stairs. There is an ADA elevator but the wait is really long to get from A to B.The staff didn't seem to know their way around the stadium or to the rideshare area."
11093,Date of experience: September 2019,26-Sep-19,SEC,Texas,5,Great stadium: be sure to take the escalator,"When you enter the stadium to get your ticket checked, be sure to get in the entrance line that puts on into the escalators queque because you're sure not gonna wanna climb the steps to either 300 or 400.  There are two entrance queues (lines) and one is for folks climbing the stairs and the other is for folks wanting the escalator route.   The stadium was sold out and it was our first ever game.  Kyle Field is something to behold!  Recently renovated...truly there are no bad seats here.  Bring binoculars unless you are down pretty low...but the JumboTron is good too.  Everything was just great, a wonderful fan experience!"
11094,Date of experience: September 2019,23-Sep-19,SEC,Texas,5,Excellent,A group of us went to the Texas A&M football game it was awesome. The atmosphere at this stadium is unreal. we loved it.
11095,Date of experience: September 2019,15-Sep-19,SEC,Texas,5,Great stadium!,This is a great stadium!  We could see the game well even from nose-bleed seats.  Restrooms were clean and fully stocked throughout the game. Take stadium seats! Lines for concessions were not long.  Great views of the Campus!  We had a great experience!
11096,Date of experience: August 2019,4-Sep-19,SEC,Texas,5,Take the Shuttle to Football Games,"In my opinion, there is only one way to attend a Texas A&M football game, the Get To The Grid Shuttle.  The shuttle leaves from the Momentum Bank Plaza on East University and drops you off about 3 blocks from the stadium.The shuttle runs from 3 hours before kickoff until 2 hours after the game, and is FREE!"
11097,Date of experience: August 2019,3-Sep-19,SEC,Texas,5,Football game,"Great venue, friendly fans in a cozy 100000+ seat stadium. Well done on the end zone renovation. The atmosphere is electric."
11099,Date of experience: September 2018,6-Aug-19,SEC,Texas,5,Great atmosphere,"Visited from Alabama, and it is a great atmosphere, and great people. Aggies couldn't have been nicer, and not a single exception to that statement. Even though they lost in a close one, we received only old-fashioned good sportsmanship type comments afterwards- unique in the SEC in that regard. Highly recommend making the trip if you are a CFB fan at any level."
11100,Date of experience: November 2018,10-Jul-19,SEC,Texas,5,The Greatest Stadium in America,"Been to Michigan, Tennessee, LSU, Florida, Florida State, Texas, the Rose Bowl... there is no place like Kyle Field on a Saturday in the fall!"
11101,Date of experience: November 2018,10-Jun-19,SEC,Texas,5,Incredible Game Day Experience!,Wonderful stadium.  Picture is outdated and needs to be updated.  Have to go for a gameday experience....best ever.
11102,Date of experience: October 2018,7-May-19,SEC,Texas,5,Kentucky vs A&M,"This was a great venue for someone who was cheering for the visiting team.  As a Kentucky fan, we were welcomed with open arms.  There was plenty of banter, but it was all in fun.  We felt like we were wanted there.  We sat in a section with all the Alumni football players.  We had a good time with them, they teased us and we gave it back with fun.  I would highly recommend getting there early to watch the cadets marching."
11103,Date of experience: September 2018,7-May-19,SEC,Texas,5,Electric Atmosphere,"Top facility. There were well over 100,000 fans when A&M hosted Clemson in football. The noise was incredible throughout the entire game, which wasn??t determined until the closing seconds. I would not want to be a visiting team for a night game. Was also very loud in the 7 overtimes when LSU visited A&M, and it was decided on the last play. Great comforts and views throughout the facility. Giant video board. Great halftime performances by the Aggie Band. Some waxing/waning in quality of food in the last few years. This would be a great place to take a young person to their first tradition-filled college football game."
11104,Date of experience: October 2018,31-Mar-19,SEC,Texas,5,Aggie Traditions,"The traditions at A&M are impressive. To some it may not seem like much, but ithey all help bring the Aggie family together. ??The Twelth Man ?? is actually based on a true event. You can feel the Aggie pride among the students. Other universities are sadly lacking anything close to this spirit. Kyle Field is an amazing place."
11105,Date of experience: October 2018,19-Mar-19,SEC,Texas,4,Retired.,"Kyle Field is an excellent Football Field, home of the Texas Aggies of Texas A&M, in College Station Texas.  Other events are held at Kyle Field from time to time, and it has a very large capacity for a home huge sports fan crowd.  Being a large school has the drawback that it takes time to get there, Park, go through security, and then exit.  Handicapped individuals will have difficulty.  But it is great for the sturdy individuals."
11106,Date of experience: November 2018,17-Mar-19,SEC,Texas,5,The place of the 12th Man,This is where the Texas Aggies play football and has been completely remodeled so it is very  nice and if you are a football fan you should make one of their games there.

11108,Date of experience: November 2018,22-Jan-19,SEC,Texas,5,Awesome experience,"You have never been to a football game until you attend a Texas Aggie game in Kyle Field. The atmosphere cannot be explained. It has to be experienced. The crowd is massive, friendly yet electrifying. It is almost a spiritual experience. The sound of the crowd and especially the Corp of Cadets marching in Kyle Field getting to your core."
11109,Date of experience: November 2018,15-Jan-19,SEC,Texas,5,Kyle Field,If you have not been to a Texas A&M football game put it on your bucket list. The atmosphere is electric. The Cadets are awesome to see marching in the stadium before each game. The band will make you appreciate what the core is all about.
11110,Date of experience: January 2019,15-Jan-19,SEC,Texas,5,Awe Inspiring Kyle Field,"Kyle Field is one of the largest stadiums in the USA. It is not only large, but full of history and interesting things to see. To start with, there are statues all around the stadium itself. A particular favorite is the War Hymn Statue, where 12 Aggie students hold hands as they sing the college hymn. There are multiple displays inside with the history of Texas A&M, and of course the field itself is magnificent with around 90,000 seats!"
11111,Date of experience: November 2018,15-Jan-19,SEC,Texas,5,Spirit of Aggieland,"Kyle Field is the heart of the Aggie Football experience. Tailgating, attending the game, kick-off and Midnight Yell Practice - you wouldn't believe how many people ask ""What time does Midnight Yell start"" They just aren't from around here. As with any college football game, the stadium gets crowded. Relax, don't be in a hurry and enjoy your time. Also note, the current students (and some former students seated with current students) all stand for the entire game. The exception is half-time. It's Aggie tradition to always be prepared to help out on the field. IF you do not want to stand, sit in the Former Student section.  This stadium is ADA compliant. And remember: clear bags only. You are not allowed to carry in a purse or backpack that is not see-through. Enjoy your visit to Aggieland!"
11112,Date of experience: November 2018,15-Dec-18,SEC,Texas,5,A must see for sports fans,"The general atmosphere is something that is amazing.  Viewing the game on the big screen makes any seat in the stadium that seats over 100,000 people an okay place to watch and listen to the fans as they are cheering on their team like no other fans do."
11113,Date of experience: November 2018,20-Nov-18,SEC,Texas,5,Great Fun!,"We had blast while attending the 2018 UAB game!  The stadium was packed and the fans are a lot of fun for A&M.  The stadium holds over !00,000 and it was near capacity when we were there.  I strongly recommend going to a game and watching the band, the corp of cadets and the game."
11114,Date of experience: November 2018,20-Nov-18,SEC,Texas,5,Great venue,Good stadium with many super fans. People treated us well and had a great time   And this from a visitor's team fan.  Enjoyed the experience.

11116,Date of experience: September 2018,15-Nov-18,SEC,Texas,5,Really Impressive,As a couple from GBR we didn't know what to expect from American College football only ever visited NFL stadiums. We were blown away. One of the fans gave us 2 free tickets at the box office which was a great start! Everyone was really welcoming and we were chanting along before the game even started. Great experience that was a highlight of our Texas road trip.
11117,Date of experience: November 2018,14-Nov-18,SEC,Texas,5,Best stadium in the world!!,My daughter attends Texas A&M and we love when we can catch a football here. Kyle Field is a work of Art. Any seat in the place is a great seat. The food is scrumptious and the excitement is contagious. You are transformed as soon as you walk into the stadium. So Gig em Aggies we will be back.

11120,Date of experience: September 2018,6-Nov-18,SEC,Texas,5,Awesome college football experience.,"New renovated Texas A&M Stadium is one of the highest rated stadiums in the SEC Conference. When the yell leaders get the student section fired up, every one is swaying back and forth chanting the Texas A&M yells. The crowd noise is unbelievable. If you are a college football fan, you must go to a Texas A&M home football game to experience this unique experience. You'll be surprised to find the student section and A&M alumni all stand the entire game. Oh, and don't forget to kiss your sweetheart when A&M scores a touchdown. It's a Texas A&M tradition. Go to a game, you'll love the entire experience. Not a bad seat in the stadium."
11121,Date of experience: October 2018,31-Oct-18,SEC,Texas,5,"The New KYLE Field, not the one pictured here.",The New Kyle Filed is a without a doubt one of the best football venues in the country. Great sight lines and no bad seats. The quality of the venue exceeds many NFL stadiums..
11122,Date of experience: September 2018,24-Oct-18,SEC,Texas,5,Texas A&M vs Clemson,"Five of us came down for the Clemson game and I can't say enough about the stadium, the A&M traditions and the fans.  Despite having one of the gates closed (someone said the staff was stuck in traffic somewhere?) we got into the stadium with no issues.  Staff was very helpful to us in finding out seats.  The traditions of A&M were awesome - from the cavalry before the game, to the student section.  And the fans - THE most gracious I've experienced in all the away games we've attended.  I would love to come back here and experience this again!"
11123,Date of experience: October 2018,14-Oct-18,SEC,Texas,5,The best there is,"If you haven't been to Kyle Field in College Station, Tx., you are in for an awesome.  The student body stands for the entire game to show support for the fooball team.  Yells are coordinated by the yell leaders in white, and are deafening.  The Aggie Band has no equal.  Their precision marching will give you chills.  The mega tv is unbelievable.  Replays are unreal.  Concession stand (if you leave the stands) have a greaat selection of food.  I graduated in '74, and Kyle field was great then.  It is awesome now.  The Aggie faithful are fantastic and exude Southern hospitality.  Don't forget to tour the campus, too!  Come see us!"
11124,Date of experience: September 2018,13-Oct-18,SEC,Texas,5,A&M vs. Clemson,"Fantastic facility for watching a football game.  The fan noise is LOUD --- totally understand the 12th man advantage.  Went to Midnight yell as well as football game.  Lots of fun.  For such a large stadium, the number of food and drink vendors seemed lacking -- we were in Section 126 and there weren't a lot of options.  Look forward to more games here."
11125,Date of experience: October 2018,8-Oct-18,SEC,Texas,5,Coolest Game Experience Ever!,"Wow! Loudest crowd I've ever experienced. 12th Man is NO JOKE!We had a blast, and everyone is awesome. My buddy was wearing opposition gear, and multiple people stopped us to thank him for being there.Uber is a great way to go TO the game, but a pretty rough way to leave, just FYI."
11126,Date of experience: October 2018,7-Oct-18,SEC,Texas,5,Huge,This stadium was immense... it??s well kept/clean w nice facilities /concessions and bathrooms. Good isn??t great but they have something. They also serve beer but only in sectioned off areas which means you won??t get a drink because you are watching a game. We were nosebleed seats way at the top and wow it was far up there and steep.. the tradition and ROTC and band and wellAll the fans..just an amazing amount of spirit and tailgating happening. Women have a cowboy boot  w a white Aggie towel hanging out of One and shirt skirt  uniform.. gents dress is jeans and nicer shirts and boots..it??s like nothing I have ever seen before Entire place was a sea of crimson. The campus is clean and beautiful..the student union and bookstore. Wow really nice. Bush library..also really nice. Glad we came to check out the college.. it was great
11127,Date of experience: September 2018,25-Sep-18,SEC,Texas,3,Since they enclosed the Horseshoe shaped stadium it looks more like a typical southern US university field.,The place has lost a lot of its soul by becoming like most other US collegiate sports venue. The pyrotechnics and loud rap music did not add to the ambience.
11128,Date of experience: September 2018,23-Sep-18,SEC,Texas,4,Texas/Clemson game,Traveled to Texas with my sister so she and my daughter could go to the game. we visited with my daughter and grandson
11129,Date of experience: September 2018,18-Sep-18,SEC,Texas,5,Kyle and College Station = SUPER,"Going to A&M for a football weekend, LUCKY,LUCKY You. Had a wonderful experience as Clemson played @ Kyle on 9/7/18. First: do Yell practice on Friday night...not sure their cadence but they know. Next, note that NO advertising around or in the the stadium, 12th man provides all the money needed. PLEADE NOTE: as a visitor your probably be way, way up in stands so, NEVER HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE, the visitors side line bench is half the width as the HOME sideline. Crazy, but true, ENJOY SUPER FANS AND A GREEEAAT EXPERIENCE.!!! Goooo Tigers!!!!"
11130,Date of experience: September 2018,17-Sep-18,SEC,Texas,5,Awesome Venue,Kyle Field is a bucket list location for a college football fan. The fans are friendly and the stadium has many food and beverage options for the average fan. It was also easily accessible.
11131,Date of experience: September 2018,17-Sep-18,SEC,Texas,5,Outstanding College Football Experience!,"Great venue.  All seats are good seats, and many seats are great seats!  The noise level is off the charts (which is good if you really like football), and the Texas A&M traditions you get to observe are entertaining and enjoyable.  The Texas A&M band too is outstanding.  I am a life long OU fan (Boomer Sooner) and I highly recommend a game at Kyle Field!!!"
11132,Date of experience: September 2018,16-Sep-18,SEC,Texas,5,Wonderful place to visit;,If you have never been to a football game here you need to add it to your bucket list! Best experience! Love Aggieland!
11133,Date of experience: September 2018,9-Sep-18,SEC,Texas,5,A Blast,I think we are all in agreement that the fans are terrific. Respectful beyond compare and I am a Tar Heel.Friendly students holding signs every 50 yds to assist you. Cooling zones. Informative and welcoming announcements. Clean. Every seat is a good one.

11134,Date of experience: August 2018,1-Sep-18,SEC,Texas,1,Gig'em,"Wow, impressive facility! Beautiful stadium which gets lively, racous with plenty room to enjoy the game."
11135,Date of experience: August 2018,22-Aug-18,SEC,Texas,5,not to be missed,"of course, its hard to miss it.  It has quite the presence.  Fly into to College Station sometime during an evening football game to get the full impact of the structure."
11136,Date of experience: October 2017,18-Aug-18,SEC,Texas,5,AMAZING,By far the best collegiate atmosphere in the United States. I MUST VISIT for any college football fan!!
11137,Date of experience: August 2018,16-Aug-18,SEC,Texas,5,Awesome Stadium,With a record crowd of about 110k this structure is emmence right in the middle of the University. No match when I went but still worth a look.
11138,Date of experience: August 2018,7-Aug-18,SEC,Texas,5,The best stadium in the land!,"This is a MUST when you are in College Station.  There is no place like Aggieland, and on game day Kyle Field will show you why.  Where else can you go with 115,000 of your closest friends?  And, the hospitality will not disappoint you.  People in Aggieland are some of the coolest ever.  When fans from other places come here they always talk about how well they were treated!  Check it out!"
11140,Date of experience: October 2017,7-Aug-18,SEC,Texas,5,Football Game,"There is nothing like an Aggie football game at Kyle Field. This is a must for everyone??s bucket list. To see the Corp march in , to hear the Aggie band play, and to cheer the team on with other Aggie fans is so much fun. There is nothing like it."
11141,Date of experience: August 2018,6-Aug-18,SEC,Texas,5,Highly impressive facility,"I was totally impressed with the size, appearance and professionally maintained condition of this wonderful facility.  It is an excellent venue to hold events.  The service personnel were excellent."
11142,Date of experience: November 2017,30-Jul-18,SEC,Texas,5,"Gig 'Em, Aggies!",Who DOESN'T love Kyle Field?!? What a wonderful football venue! The grounds are immaculately kept and there's plenty of paid parking within (short) walking distance of the field. They have great concessions and the stands are comfortable. Our favorite place to be during football season for games and tailgating. Looking forward to the start of the season!
11143,Date of experience: November 2017,22-Jul-18,SEC,Texas,5,Football experience at its best,"It doesn't get any better then this , great games, great viewing, crowds, spirit, wonderful facilities."
11144,Date of experience: August 2017,14-Jul-18,SEC,Texas,5,Impressive!!,"Whether the Aggies win or lose, this is an impressive field.  The last time I marched on this field was nearly 20 years ago and I cannot believe how this stadium has grown."
11148,Date of experience: September 2017,19-Jun-18,SEC,Texas,5,Awesome experience,"Texas A&M University, aka Aggies, have many traditions and none are more on display than at a football game. The student section moves as one unit through yells (not cheers), kiss at every score and the entire crowd joins together in the ""war hymn"" aka ""Saw Varsity Horns Off"". Win or lose the experience is worth a visit."
11150,Date of experience: September 2017,1-Jun-18,SEC,Texas,4,Football viewing,"Kyle field is home to the Texas A&M football team. We went to a game ith the kids in the fall. Inhave to say, I know it's TX, but dang was it hot. There is NO shade, so hot. Good views from all around.  Kids espeically like the Revielle grave yard out front."
11152,Date of experience: November 2017,11-May-18,SEC,Texas,5,Great Football Viewing,Was there to see a game with our grandson & see the Core march in & take part in the football game. A must!
11154,Date of experience: November 2017,9-Apr-18,SEC,Texas,1,Bad parking...way too loud...games too long,"Football at Kyle Field is a long undertaking.  Hard to go, park, go to game, come home without spending hours.  Games are okay, though Aggies are the Aggies...even with new coach and big upgrades, they still will be outclassed.  Better to stay home and watch on TV.  Food, parking overpriced...good seats hard to come by...overall more hype than reality...."
11158,Date of experience: November 2017,4-Feb-18,SEC,Texas,5,The excitement in Aggieland makes for a great experience,Great experience in a great facility. Good seats good refreshments. Highly recommend.Good for family or adults.
11159,Date of experience: October 2017,21-Jan-18,SEC,Texas,5,Aggie Football,"There??s nothing quite like the roar of 100,000+ fans in Kyle Field. Looking forward to being in Aggieland again. Gig??em."
11160,Date of experience: January 2018,9-Jan-18,SEC,Texas,5,Awesome,This place is unbelievable.I never thought it would be so big.A must see when visiting College Station.
11161,Date of experience: November 2017,8-Dec-17,SEC,Texas,5,THE MOST AMAZING PLACE EVER!!,"It doesn't matter who the Aggies play or whether they win or lose, game day at Kyle Field is the ultimate experience!  An awesome fan base, amazing traditions & plenty of energy!  It is clean, safe and well worth the visit!  Take the time to watch the Corps of Cadets march into Kyle Field (1-1/2 hours prior to any kick-off).  You WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!"
11162,Date of experience: November 2017,18-Nov-17,SEC,Texas,5,Great fun!,"So much tradition at TAM - experiencing a football game at TAM is a step above other SEC stadiums.  The facilities are clean, and security is ample.  Best of all, the traffic route leaving Kyle has been engineered for the most efficient mass exit we've  experienced yet."
11163,Date of experience: October 2017,17-Nov-17,SEC,Texas,5,Gorgeous Stadium!,I really enjoyed my trip to Kyle Field.  I was extremely impressed with the quality of the video screens.  Food is outstanding.  I highly recommend the pepperoni rolls. Wonderful staff.  Be prepared for some walking.  Uber is very good in College Station.
11165,Date of experience: November 2017,14-Nov-17,SEC,Texas,5,Built for spectator comfort,"When they rebuilt Kyle Field they built it for spectator comfort and convenience. Unlike most college stadiums I have visited. They made the seats wider and the rows farther apart.  People could walk between us and the row in front of us and we remained seated.   The only other stadium where I have experienced that was in Lexington,Ky. When I went to  buy lunch I could still watch the game while waiting in line. The restrooms were convenient. There were only two rows above where I was seating. I was able to go down use the restroom and get back to my seat during a timeout.  I would like to think other colleges would study Kyle Field when they rebuild.  By the way. I am not an Aggie fan I am an Auburn fan."
11166,Date of experience: November 2017,12-Nov-17,SEC,Texas,5,Still Getting Bigger and BETTER,"I lived in CS from 1993-95 & attended classes at A&M, but only made a few games and yell practices because I worked 2 full-time jobs. I've only been back 3 times since 95, but the most recent was an incredible experience as I took my daughter and her friend for a college visit. We saw Kyle Field as part of the A&M prospective student walking tour. We saw it again for Midnight Yell Practice, and of course on game day. This is the largest, most beautiful, and perhaps most storied stadium in the SEC (and third largest in the US). You MUST see Kyle Field...it is INCREDIBLE!"
11167,Date of experience: November 2017,11-Nov-17,SEC,Texas,5,Top 5 College Gameday Experience,"By far one of the best college football gameday experiences for fans of either the Aggies or their opponents. If your team has Texas A&M on there schedule and you've never been, you're missing out. Great tailgating. Friendly people."
11168,Date of experience: November 2017,10-Nov-17,SEC,Texas,5,Football weekend,Here for the first time since renovations were completed. Seating in the new stadium is much roomier than before. Sat in the south end zone with a good view of the playing field.  We were on level two with good choices for food and drinks.
11169,Date of experience: November 2017,10-Nov-17,SEC,Texas,5,Rally to the Guidons,"Rally to the Guidons - Former A&M cadets march in behind all the current cadets and the Fighting Texas Aggie Band into the new Kyle Field stadium that holds over 100,000.   What an exciting event for all in attendance."
11170,Date of experience: November 2017,8-Nov-17,SEC,Texas,5,"Nice people, great stadium","I have visited most SEC schools on football Saturday, but I had never been to Kyle field. I was pleasantly surprised with how nice the campus was and very happy with all the people we met. The Aggie faithful were very kind and accommodating answering all of our questions and thanking us for making the trip. I used to wonder why they were in the SEC, now I know they exude southern hospitality. Thanks for the visit and I enjoyed your very-large stadium."
11171,Date of experience: November 2017,5-Nov-17,SEC,Texas,5,Midnight Yell,"I went to Midnight Yell with my daughter, who is a student at Texas A&M.  It was really fun and got us ready for the game the next day.  And yes, it started at midnight!"
11172,Date of experience: October 2017,3-Nov-17,SEC,Texas,5,"Huge football stadium, amazing crowd","Aggie football games are like none other. Even if you are not an Aggie, it is fun seeing how involved the crowd gets in the game no matter the score."
11173,Date of experience: October 2017,30-Oct-17,SEC,Texas,4,Football Game,"Just returned from a Saturday evening football game at Kyle Field. Terrific facility, terrible food. We had premium seats and  paid $24 for a lukewarm hot dog and a odd  tasting sausage in a bun. Even a cookie costs 5 bucks. The staff as expected, is made up of students with little training. With all the advertising in the stadium, and the exorbitant cost of tickets, the management could do better by its  patrons."
11174,Date of experience: October 2017,30-Oct-17,SEC,Texas,5,One of the Best,"Kyle Field is one of the top places to attend a college football game in our great nation.  The atmosphere is electric, traditions surround you before, during and after the game and the actual stadium is amazing.  Walking outside the tailgaters are right across from the stadium in a park.  It was really cool watching everyone have a good time before the game.  Now the actual game was a bit disappointing as A&M didn't fair very well against Miss St but the experience can't be beat."
11175,Date of experience: October 2017,15-Oct-17,SEC,Texas,5,Always a great game experience!,"Love heading to Kyle Field for the game! After the renovations, lots of food choices, no line for the ladies' room, wish all the towers has escalators and not the old ramps, but oh well. All the improvements are so nice!"
11176,Date of experience: October 2017,15-Oct-17,SEC,Texas,5,TAMU,"Great experience, as always at Kyle Field!  Fans are great, and it a great family experience! Love the Aggies!"
11177,Date of experience: September 2017,12-Oct-17,SEC,Texas,5,Amazing place to see college football,"Attended the Texas A&M vs. University of Louisiana LaFayette game in September. Great pre-game atmosphere including the cadet corps parade into the field. The facilities are modern and comfortable, and the team plays exciting football. The team spirit and school traditions have to be seen to be believed. I would recommend this to any football fan."
11178,Date of experience: October 2017,11-Oct-17,SEC,Texas,4,Wow!  What a beautiful stadium!,"Enjoyed our visit for a TAMU game.  Seating was ample.  View was good.  Bathrooms were clean.  Concessions were plentiful.  Bring your walking shoes though.  Our seats were in the top level and I won??t lie, it was quite a walk.  Love how ample the ramp up was.  Great design."
11179,Date of experience: November 2016,11-Oct-17,SEC,Texas,5,Greatest stadium,The home of the 12th man has to be the best stadium in college football.  The air is electric and it is an amazing experience to see the Aggies play here!
11180,Date of experience: October 2017,11-Oct-17,SEC,Texas,5,Awesome facility and LOUD!,"Great facility. Parking nearby wasn't a problem (lots of garages). $25 for us at the North Garage, but worth it. Ramps in the stadium seem limited for leaving. Some exits were blocked, so it took a while."
11181,Date of experience: October 2017,9-Oct-17,SEC,Texas,5,Very cool,There is so much tradition at this school!! Had a great time at the game and the people were very nice
11182,Date of experience: October 2017,8-Oct-17,SEC,Texas,5,Gig'em!??????,Close friend is an Alumni and took us to a game. I have been to many stadiums and this is truly one of the loudest. The people were fantastic! A&M has a great gameday tradition and Kyle Field makes for a great gameday experience.
11183,Date of experience: October 2017,8-Oct-17,SEC,Texas,5,Aggie Stadium and fans among the BEST,I recently came to College Station for the annual Bama v TAM game.  This stadium is the best college football stadium that I have been to and I have been to many. The TAM fans are terrific sports fans and they are gracious hosts.  The sportsmanship is unsurpassed. The stadium is large and it gets very loud.  It is easy to get to your seat and all the seats have great views.
11184,Date of experience: September 2017,3-Oct-17,SEC,Texas,5,Gig Em!,Went to College Station last weekend to visit my son and decided to attend the game. Have been to numerous college football games. I even graduated from another SEC school. This is the best stadium. The atmosphere is incredible! Can't wait to attend another game.
11185,Date of experience: September 2017,3-Oct-17,SEC,Texas,5,Fantastic Venue for college football,"This stadium is awesome.  My son and I had the opportunity to attend our first Aggie game.  The stadium is beautiful and is easy to get in and out of with no delays or issues.  But the game experience is something I have never experienced; from the marching band to the student section, it was an incredible sporting event.  My 10 year old is ready to sign his letter of intent and commit to the Aggies."
11186,Date of experience: September 2017,3-Oct-17,SEC,Texas,5,Beautiful,Beautiful stadium... too bad we heard the bathrooms were out of order for everyone during the South Carolina game!
11187,Date of experience: October 2017,1-Oct-17,SEC,Texas,5,Whoop!!!!,"There is no better place in the country to watch a football game.  Awesome tailgating, great game day atmosphere, and more traditions than you can imagine.  The stadium has basically been rebuilt over the last 5 years and louder than any other college football venue in America.  You will enjoy everything from midnight yell, to a great football game, to the best military band around.  This is fun for the whole family."
11188,Date of experience: September 2017,22-Sep-17,SEC,Texas,5,Great stadium!,"Recently attended a Texas A&M football game at Kyle Field,  Had great seats, they won, and the field was awesome!"
11190,Date of experience: September 2017,20-Sep-17,SEC,Texas,5,Wow!,What an experience! The place is rockin'. The Aggie's know how to do football! Its all about the Aggie's!! Great gift shops and concessions!
11191,Date of experience: September 2017,19-Sep-17,SEC,Texas,5,Excellent Game at Kyle Field,Good time with all the Aggie Traditions included!  Everyone was very friendly and helpful. We were in the 3rd deck but could see really well. Be sure to wear sunscreen- very intense sun in the 3rd deck. Concessions were easily available with quick service. Bathroom was clean. The Aggie band was a highlight.
11192,Date of experience: September 2017,18-Sep-17,SEC,Texas,5,Amazing Football venue.,Amazing Football venue. Helpful and friendly staff !  Clean and well maintained bathrooms before and during the game !
11193,Date of experience: September 2017,17-Sep-17,SEC,Texas,5,Wow,Texans love this place cult like following and i was in awe when i walked into the stadium Saturday for the game against LA. Its well worth a visit. Was disappointed with paying 10.00 to park. Check the campus out it is the largest campus I've ever visited. Smell like money
11194,Date of experience: September 2017,16-Sep-17,SEC,Texas,5,A&M vs Louisiana Ragin Cajins,I've not been to an A&M game in 41 years and my husband has never been. The new Kyle Field is amazing. We were in the top section(350) but the view of the game was perfect. It was cloudy when the game started but that did not last long as it became very hot and humid. Typical Texas day. Great adventure and topped off with an Aggie win. We used the shuttle to and from Kyle Field and it was well organized. Overall perfect day.
11195,Date of experience: September 2017,13-Sep-17,SEC,Texas,5,Aggie Football Game,"An Aggie Football game is arguably one of the best College Football Experiences in the Nation.  Groups all over campus tailgating, and most are more than happy to share their beer and food with anyone that comes along.  The stadium is loud, but not over bearing.  Its neat to see how students and fans can affect a foodball game like Aggies do.  This is also one of the biggest stadiums in Sports, but almost every seat is a good one.  The Higher seats are great for watching the Aggie Band and lower seats almost make you feel like your on the field.  Seats are not cheap, but there are ways to save a little money.  If you feel like spending a little more, the Legacy Club can make for a great game day experience with food and beer available during the game."
11196,Date of experience: August 2017,6-Aug-17,SEC,Texas,5,Best atmosphere in college football,"If you ever want to take someone to a college football game, take them to a game at Kyle Field. It's incredibly loud, big, and an experience you'll never forget. Overall one of the best atmospheres in college football."
11197,Date of experience: August 2017,5-Aug-17,SEC,Texas,5,2017 Vacation,"Have visited this field since the early 60s. It's amazing how it has grown, but still has the amazing spirit and yet still feels like home!"
11199,Date of experience: September 2016,26-Jul-17,SEC,Texas,4,Belgian Student visiting Texas A&M University,"Overall very impressive stadium, our biggest stadium (in Belgium) is nothing in comparison to this one, the capacity of Kyle Field is twice the capacity of our biggest stadium !"
11207,Date of experience: September 2016,16-Jun-17,SEC,Texas,5,Best college stadium you'll ever find,"Large and loud with one of the greatest student sections in the nation. Be prepared for an experience if you're coming to a game. Be aware if you have tickets in the student section you will stand the whole time as it is a time honored tradition. If it's not game season still stop by and take a look of the outside and the statues. There is a parking garage across the street. The graveyard for all the Reveilles is on the outside with a score board for them to look over the game. If you're in town the night before a home game, the stadium opens up for a free midnight yell practice. This is a great time to see the spirit of Aggieland and to stand with the students and residents of the area practicing the cheers to be used for the next day. A&M is a place of tradition and you will see it everywhere you go on the campus including the stadium."
11208,Date of experience: October 2016,22-May-17,SEC,Texas,5,The Best,I had the privilege to attend a game last year with my wife's big shout out to St.Joesph Cancer Center thanks a lot. Back to the field it is simply the worlds best College Football Field period. Nothing but the best. It is a privilege to attend a game there.
11210,Date of experience: November 2016,17-Apr-17,SEC,Texas,5,Midnight Yell and a game,"Kyle field was packed even though it was midnight for their Yell tradition. As a former Red Raider (wreck 'em), it was neat to partake in this tradition with my Aggie daughter. A&M has many long-standing traditions and it is easy to enjoy. We also attended a game the next day at Kyle Field. Even though we were absolutely at the very top row of the stadium, surprisingly you can still see what is going on - on the field. Neat place!"
11211,Date of experience: November 2016,15-Apr-17,SEC,Texas,5,Best college football stadium in the country,Great place to watch college football. The spirit in the stadium is overwhelming. Aggies are friendly and love the competition. And of course there's the Fightin' Texas Aggie Band. World class!!
11212,Date of experience: August 2016,12-Apr-17,SEC,Texas,5,You'll roast in the hot summer sun standing in the student side...,"...but seats and shade abound in the other 3/4 of the stadium. Keep cash on hand for some of the concessions, like the awesome frozen lemonade. You can only bring in clear bags, unless they're very small (like a wallet). You *can* bring in any sized water container as long as it is still sealed, so absolutely take in a gallon on hot days (to avoid paying $$ for bottled aquafina during the 4 hour games)."
11213,Date of experience: October 2016,10-Apr-17,SEC,Texas,5,"Kyle Field, an experience you won't forget","Kyle Field is the Football Stadium on the campus of Texas A&M University. Located 90 miles from Austin, 90 miles from Houston, 90 miles from Waco, and 200 miles from Dallas, it is centrally located for millions of fans. The seating capacity of 102,733 makes the stadium the largest in the Southeastern Conference and the fourth largest stadium in the NCAA, fourth largest stadium in the United States, and the fifth largest non-racing stadium in the world. Within the state of Texas, Kyle Field has the largest regular seating capacity. Kyle Field's largest game attendance was 110,631 on October 11, 2014.[5] This was the largest football game attendance in the state of Texas and SEC history.But size isn't the only thing about Kyle Field. Until you have witnessed the ""12th Man"" in a football game, where over 30,000 students stand for the entire game, and the yells are coordinated to resonate in the stadium, you just haven't heard a game day crowd. As a bonus, attendees get to witness the ""Fightin' Texas Aggie Band"" at halftime. The Fightin?? Texas Aggie Band is nationally known for its precision military marching formations on the football gridiron and is the largest military marching band in the nation. This 400+ member, Corps of Cadets unit is the official marching band of Texas A&M University. Performing at all home football games and several away games, this organization is one of the most traveled collegiate marching bands in the nation. The Aggie Band operates under strict military guidelines as an integral part of the Corps of Cadets. The Aggie Band was presented the Sudler Trophy from the John Philip Sousa Foundation in 2001 in recognition of the long tradition of excellence established by the organization.Lastly, Texas Aggies are super friendly to visitors on the campus on game day. Wear your home school colors when you come to visit, and you will receive a traditional ""Howdy"" from the passing students and ""Old Aggie"" alumni."
11219,Date of experience: September 2016,13-Feb-17,SEC,Texas,5,Best Venue in collegiate Sports,Has to be experienced. It's a bucket list venue. Midnight yell on friday before a home game gives you a sampling of Aggie tradition. Not to be missed.
11220,Date of experience: December 2016,5-Feb-17,SEC,Texas,5,A MUST,"Kyle Field is an icon in our community and difficult to miss.  Even if you visit in a off season (football) you will find many people walking around Kyle Field.  You will be greeted by everyone you pass.  Have questions.....there surely will be someone there to direct and answer your inquiries (a passing student, etc)"
11221,Date of experience: January 2017,30-Jan-17,SEC,Texas,5,Incredible!,Highly recommend visiting the new Kyle Field when visiting College Station. It is just incredible. Well worth the time.
11222,Date of experience: November 2016,19-Jan-17,SEC,Texas,5,True Football Experience,"Kyle Field is absolutely incredible. With the Aggie Spirit, thousands of fans, huge stadium, and great concessions food, one can truly experience college football how it's supposed to be experienced!"
11225,Date of experience: December 2016,30-Dec-16,SEC,Texas,5,Home of the Aggies,"We were in town and decided to drive by Kyle Field for photo ops, and there were plenty of photo ops to be found. Pretty cool being there and seeing where the Aggies play!"
11226,Date of experience: October 2016,29-Dec-16,SEC,Texas,5,great,so they want me to post more details which is silly since  I have nothing to say that hasn't been said about kyle field. there is no place I would rather be on a Saturday.Aggie football rocks !
11227,Date of experience: November 2016,20-Dec-16,SEC,Texas,5,The atmosphere is electric,"As an Aggie I may be a little biased in my review but I will endeavor to remain objective:If you follow the SEC, you haven't really experienced a college football game until you've been to one at Kyle Field. I remember my buddies from UT Austin recommending catching a game here as a must-do for their families that were taking a trip to College Station -  and that says a LOT! The atmosphere is electric here at one of the biggest football stadiums in USA. It is even better after the renovation and extension in 2015."
11228,Date of experience: November 2016,2-Dec-16,SEC,Texas,5,Fantastic Football Stadium,"The reconstruction of Kyle Field is amazing! This has to be one of the best football stadiums in the country. If you are an Aggie, you already know this, but if you are a visitor supporting another team, you will love the friendlyness and respect the Aggies will show you.  Make arrangements early to park in one of the nearby garages. Arrive early enough to watch the Corp march in.  Be sure to stay during half-time to watch the Aggie Band perform. They are better than any other college band you will ever see."
11229,Date of experience: August 2016,2-Dec-16,SEC,Texas,4,Renovations are nice!,"It is a great stadium and gameday experience. I would rank it in my top 25 college football experiences, - but it isn't the top 10. The fans are wonderful and it's a fun time. If there is a game going on when you are in town - stop by.The facility is beautiful! If you can get a tour, try to do that as well!"
11230,Date of experience: November 2016,27-Nov-16,SEC,Texas,4,For the Sports Fan!,My son enjoyed being in a place that he normally only see on television.  He was very impressed with the stadium and knowing that teams he like to watch play on this field.
11231,Date of experience: November 2016,26-Nov-16,SEC,Texas,5,Aggie Football vs LSU,"This is without a doubt one of the finest stadiums in the south.  It's a great place to tailgate, stroll thru campus & see Aggie traditions and obviously watch some SEC Football!"
11232,Date of experience: November 2016,21-Nov-16,SEC,Texas,5,Midnight Yell is a must do event,Kyle field is huge. Great atmosphere. Going to the midnight yell the night before home game really shows the school spirit. The school band (Core of Cadets) is top notch.
11233,Date of experience: November 2016,17-Nov-16,SEC,Texas,5,Football,"The tailgating, friends, Texas A&M football, tradition. Kyle field has it all.  What a great time we had watching the Corp march in. The band at halftime...wow.  People are great."
11234,Date of experience: October 2016,16-Nov-16,SEC,Texas,5,Don't miss this!,"If you have an opportunity to see a game here, don't miss it! Second best SEC stadium experience. Also, the midnight yell the night before was pretty cool to see. Go Vols!"
11235,Date of experience: October 2016,14-Nov-16,SEC,Texas,5,NO place like it on Earth!  Home of the Fightin Texas Aggies!,"It's Kyle Field... Nicest  fans, Most Loyal fans! There truly is NO PLACE  like Aggieland!  Listening to the  Fightin Texas Aggie  Band during March in...makes your heart swell up!"
11236,Date of experience: November 2016,13-Nov-16,SEC,Texas,5,Electric atmosphere,"Incredible place to attend a ballgame. The A&M fans were very friendly and having almost 105,000 people in the stadium makes for a loud electric atmosphere. Great venue for an opposing fan away trip - which is what we were. Would definitely recommend a road trip to A&M for a football game if an SEC fan.We won the game which makes it a lot more enjoyable but as I said the A&M fans were extremely friendly."
11237,Date of experience: November 2016,12-Nov-16,SEC,Texas,5,One of a Kind!,"Few can argue that an experience at Kyle Field is unlike any other stadium. The lights, energy, amenities and if course RAVING FANS creates an environment for college football that rivals most NFL experiences."
11238,Date of experience: October 2016,9-Nov-16,SEC,Texas,2,Football game,Food is adequate at best and pricey.  Levy's is not a good contractor.  I am surprised we contracted them for more than 5 years.  Some of the vendors you cannot understand and they have a hard time giving change.
11239,Date of experience: November 2016,5-Nov-16,SEC,Texas,5,College Visit,"We were gifted tickets to the Homecoming game. Although parking was difficult to find & expensive ($30 in a parking lot if a business), we only had to walk 1 block after we had been driving around for at least 39 minutes. It wax easy to get into the stadium & walk up to our seats. We were there early & the concession areas were big & had lots of space for people to walk around. Lines were never too long. I have a fear of heights & was very worried that sitting in the front row on the third tier was going to be bad. It really wasn't bad at all. It didn't feel too steep like some venues. I also noticed how clean the grounds were. It was a great experience for my 1st A&M game."
11240,Date of experience: October 2016,3-Nov-16,SEC,Texas,4,Worth experiencing one game there,I can not mark off experiencing a Texas A&M football game. No matter where you sit you can see and fill the traditions of A&M. The marching band at halftime is also a must see.
11241,Date of experience: October 2016,1-Nov-16,SEC,Texas,5,Great venue to watch the Aggies!,Love to attend ballgames at Kyle Field - best football in the SEC!Rich in tradition and spirit - it cannot be beat for a fun weekend.
11242,Date of experience: September 2016,22-Oct-16,SEC,Texas,5,"Seating makes a difference, but great atmosphere",Becareful of seats in the North endzone if you go up the area there are several pinchpoints in the corner of the upper deck that no one could move for 10-20 minutes just before kick off.  30 to fourty people deep in all directions.  Not a good place to be in heat.
11243,Date of experience: September 2016,19-Oct-16,SEC,Texas,5,A Temple To The Football Gods,"Announcers and fans who have visited agree, Kyle Field should be on the bucket list of any college football fan.  As impressive as the building is, there are many things that made it special even before the rebuild:  top-notch SEC football; classy fans, collectively known as The 12th Man; a flyover before most games; the Aggie Band; students standing throughout the game; Yell Leaders; Midnight Yell Practice.  We like to watch the team walk in before the game, followed by the Corps."
11244,Date of experience: August 2016,17-Oct-16,SEC,Texas,5,Must-see!,This football stadium is a must-see! It is massive and filled with great sculptures of past football legends and of course the 12th Man...wow! My daughter is a freshman this year at A&M and visiting this football field was icing on the cake. Gig 'em!
11245,Date of experience: October 2016,15-Oct-16,SEC,Texas,5,Friendly Fans at its besr,Visited for the TN and A&M game - some of the nicest fans on the planet.  I have never been to a stadium where folks welcome you and thank you for coming.  All the traditions that go on a Kyle Field prior to an A&M game is worth the trip to experience.  Go to the midnight yell on Friday night before a home game.
11246,Date of experience: October 2016,13-Oct-16,SEC,Texas,4,Great away Game,"Being with the visiting team, the original UT, we had a great experience at Kyle Field great upper deck seats, loud, and lots of fun.  Everyone was very Friendly and gracious, even after the game,Great tailgate experience also"
11247,Date of experience: October 2016,12-Oct-16,SEC,Texas,5,Best Football in Texas,"Greatest football experience in Texas. A fantastic facility, Do yourself a favor and plan on watching the Fighting Texas Aggies in Kyle Field. And don't forget the Fighting Texas Aggie Band!"
11248,Date of experience: October 2016,12-Oct-16,SEC,Texas,5,Tennessee vs A&M game,"Very nice stadium and field. Travelled from Tennessee to watch football game. People of A&M were extra friendly. No heckling of any sort here. Good place to travel to an away game with your children. Not a bad seat in the house as we were in the upper deck behind goal post and saw the whole game very well. Very loud stadium, but we're used to that in Tennessee."
11249,Date of experience: October 2016,12-Oct-16,SEC,Texas,5,GAME TIME....,"if your and AGGIE you know this place is special.  If your not and AGGIE come visit and see for yourself this place is special.  With 100,000 plus aggies all chanting and swaying you have to believe the 12th man is real!  TIP watch out for FAKE TICKETS.  Better tip if you find yoru self in that bind with a fake ticket, DO go to the resolution window.  They will take care of you if they can they hold some seats back for just that reason!  WOOP!"
11250,Date of experience: October 2016,12-Oct-16,SEC,Texas,5,Amazing Stadium with Amazing People,"I and a few of my less than reputable friends enjoy a wild time following the Tennessee Volunteers. We were 5-0 this year and riding high into College Station. First thing, the stadium is big, I don't necessarily know if that is because its so flat around the stadium or not. Neyland is big as well, but the hills really limit the scale.  Everyone is super friendly in College Station. Like otherworldly. I had to heckle someone to be mean to me, they did and then immediately apologized.  Gracious hosts. Back to the stadium. I have reviewed stadiums before, go look at my Ben Hill Griffin review, and while I think about it: FLORIDA SUCKS. It takes an eternity to scale this monolith to where A&M seats visiting fans, that said its a nice stairway to heaven.  I never waited in line for the bathroom and the concessions were well laid out.  The video boards from the stratosphere were a bit hard to see, but the overall experience was magical. If you are on the fence about going to a game or not, you should.  As per usual Tennessee lost, but the stadium and fans more than made up for it. 10 out of 10 would do again."
11251,Date of experience: October 2016,12-Oct-16,SEC,Texas,5,Best College Gameday Experience,"Granted my review is biased, as I'm an Aggie.  But Kyle Field is a must see location when visiting College Station.  The new stadium is impressive.  Many gates allow for almost no lines when entering.  New bathrooms all around the stadium.  Remember ear muffs for the little ones, this place gets loud!"
11252,Date of experience: October 2016,11-Oct-16,SEC,Texas,5,We lost the game but had fun!,This is a beautiful stadium.  It was so clean and easy to navigate.  We had a great time even though we lost to A&M.  Parked very close to stadium as well and parking garage was well lit and clean.
11253,Date of experience: October 2016,10-Oct-16,SEC,Texas,5,A&M Tennessee football,"The new Kyle field is overwhelming! We were part of 106,000 spectators for a very exciting football game"
11254,Date of experience: October 2016,10-Oct-16,SEC,Texas,3,interesting,Entering was fairly easy. The ramps were long and little scary while leaving. They had plenty of bathrooms.
11255,Date of experience: October 2016,9-Oct-16,SEC,Texas,5,Whoop!!!,"Kyle Field is the home stadium for the Fightin' Texas Aggie Football Team.  It has been a place of both winnings and being outscored (sometimes) for decades.For the new to the area, some tips:1) Close in parking lots are for the disabled.  On game days, standard parking permits may not apply.  Parking passes are $20 per vehicle in most lots, so carpool to save money and save spaces.2) The crowds at Kyle Field have been so loud as to draw penalties from the refs, protests from the visiting coaches, and misplays by visiting teams.3) If you're lost ask ANYONE for help.  Students, staff, officers, anyone will be more than happy to assist you."
11256,Date of experience: September 2016,3-Oct-16,SEC,Texas,5,Are you ready for some football??!!,The new Kyle Field can easily accommodate the large crowds for football season.  They have added additional food services and areas to rest if the sun gets too hot.
11257,Date of experience: September 2016,25-Sep-16,SEC,Texas,5,Home of the Fighting Texas Aggie Football Team,"The new Kyle Field (not the one in the picture) is a first class college football stadium, seating over 104,000.  The lounge areas are second to none.  The seats are comfortable and the large scoreboard is second only to the giant screen at Jerry's World in Dallas."
11258,Date of experience: September 2016,23-Sep-16,SEC,Texas,4,Redone is very nice,"The redone Kyle Field is major upgrade to the previous set up and now making the entire stadium is tied together.  The crowd is very rowdy and make up the 12th man tradition.  I love the war Hymn and the entire stadium sways, as a visitor team supporter it will make you think the stadium is shaking.  Great experience."
11259,Date of experience: November 2015,21-Sep-16,SEC,Texas,5,Aggie pride,A real different experience in college football. All Aggies fans stand for the entire game. Only sit at halftime. Fantastic people. Great tail gaiters. Lots of fun.
11260,Date of experience: September 2016,13-Sep-16,SEC,Texas,5,Kyle Field is the absolute best college football stadium in the U.S of A!,Hands down the best college football stadium in the country!  The 12th Man is second to none fan base for any sport!
11261,Date of experience: September 2016,13-Sep-16,SEC,Texas,5,Awesome!,"If you want to experience Aggie Tradition, attend a football game! From the structured Aggie Yells to the cannon fired after each touchdown.  There's no bad seat in the stadium. Snacks and drinks are pricey, but what can you expect! It is best to catch a free shuttle bus to the game vs. trying to park close to the stadium.  Go and experience the Pride of Aggieland at Kyle Field."
11262,Date of experience: August 2016,12-Sep-16,SEC,Texas,5,I love the Aggies im a big fan,I loved that the hotel is so close to the field and u got Restaurtents all around and even a HEB close by and walking distance to the Salt Grass Steak House
11263,Date of experience: September 2016,12-Sep-16,SEC,Texas,5,Amazing Venue!,"This place was electrifying, Stadium is huge!, Full of rich Traditions and great people, Signs were easily readable so getting around was very simple, food was good lines were not long, and the the stadium is very well maintained"
11264,Date of experience: September 2016,8-Sep-16,SEC,Texas,5,Best college football stadium and crowd anywhere!,"Kyle Field is a must among your top 5 stadium visits, but for me it's Number 1.  Aggies, while feverishly passionate about their team, are generally friendly to visitors and sober.  The new stadium brings you closer to the action than any other 100,000 seat stadium and has something for everyone.  The west side Club Level is amazing!  Go see a game here even if you hate the Aggies.  You'll be glad you did!"
11265,Date of experience: September 2016,7-Sep-16,SEC,Texas,5,HUGE,The only thing that is better than Kyle field is Kyle Field when all the Aggies are there for a football game.
11266,Date of experience: September 2016,7-Sep-16,SEC,Texas,5,Aggie Stadium Class,I have been to a lot of college football games. But I have never seen the combination of great enthusiasm and courtesy that the Aggie fans demonstrate. They were classy and kind to the UCLA fans and were also in a frenzy for their Aggie football team. Kyle field is spacious and beautiful. The new stadium is fantastic. I love our US military so I got great big goosebumps when the Aggie band made up of the Corp of Cadets marched to and into the stadium. The fly over by 4 jets at the start of the game was fantastic. What a great place -- can't wait to go back again !!!!
11267,Date of experience: September 2016,7-Sep-16,SEC,Texas,5,Best people anywhere for Football,"Tailgating was amazing. Came from UCLA area and was invited by many for free beer and food if we wanted. So hospitable and nice alumni and students. What a delight to be in enemy territory and be welcomed like that, would never happen in LA. Kyle field was electrifying, over 100,000 fans screaming and dancing and singing. Great football venue for college games. Was very HOT but loved the experience and would recommend a college game there for sure"
11268,Date of experience: November 2015,7-Sep-16,SEC,Texas,5,great place to see,It is a great place to see and learn the history about the field and all that goes on at the field. It is fine to go to one of the games to see how the people stand and join together to show there joy to be at this college.
11269,Date of experience: September 2016,6-Sep-16,SEC,Texas,5,This place is special!,"I have been to over a dozen college football stadiums including the Big House in Ann Arbor and the Rose Bowl. Kyle Field beats them all. This is the loudest venue for college football and the rich traditions make it a very special place.   Best of all, the Aggie fans are welcoming and generous to visiting fans."
11270,Date of experience: September 2016,6-Sep-16,SEC,Texas,5,True Twelfth Man Experience,"What can I say? This stadium is awesome. As an Aggie fan, I got the true Twelfth Man experience. We went for the TAMU vs UCLA game. There were 100,443 in attendance with about 100k of those being Aggie fans. It was loud & proud. Our seats were in the nosebleed section but we didn't even care. We had a good view  of the field, the screens, the band, the plane flyover, the clouds (lol), the entire stadium of maroon. It was a magnificent day at Kyle field. I can't wait to go back!"
11271,Date of experience: September 2016,5-Sep-16,SEC,Texas,4,"$500,000,000.00 ""renovation"" and the worst food service in the world.","The facility is impressive, but the escalators only hold two abreast while other stadiums have escalators that hold 3-4 per riser.  Needs escalators on south end of west side, also.  But the worst part of the whole 500 million dollar deal is the wretchedly horrible food service system.  They run out of water early as well as drinks and food.  Water is not cold.  Service is abysmal.  Apparently the university gets a cut and is unwilling to get rid of this very, very poor provider.  This is a yearly recurring theme since the renovation with no positive response from the university.  Truly bad experience which detracts significantly from you ability to have a good time.  The folks who have pain good money--and a lot of it--deserve better, but no....great venue otherwise and they seem to have finally figured out the sound issues that have plagued the stadium the last year or two."
11272,Date of experience: September 2016,3-Sep-16,SEC,Texas,4,Family plan,"It was our first time in the stadium, it is spacious and easy to go around. It helps to use the Destination Aggieland app to find the best way to get the section of the tickets. The football experience is amazing with the fans tradition and an espectacular band."
11273,Date of experience: September 2016,3-Sep-16,SEC,Texas,4,Football Aggies,"I was there 2 days before the first game of the season with UCLA.  The grounds out front the the stadium were abuzz in preparation. Enjoyed the 12th Man and yell traditions.  With a 91,000 capacity stadium game day doubles the population of C-Station."
11274,Date of experience: October 2015,20-Aug-16,SEC,Texas,5,"Weather was awful, had a fantastic time anyway!!!","This is a fabulous facility, anywhere you sit you can see the game and the band well. The excitement is contagious and it's impossible not to get into the spirit of the Aggies!"
11275,Date of experience: October 2015,19-Aug-16,SEC,Texas,5,Football,Want to enjoy College football? Go see the Aggies play. We have season tickets. And a very Big WHOOP to Mr and Mrs Young. Welcome.
11277,Date of experience: October 2015,17-Aug-16,SEC,Texas,5,Is there a more exciting place on earth?,"The only complaint I could have about such an amazing place is that it has ruined me.  NFL games aren't as exciting any more.  The atmosphere at Kyle Field is like none other.  So drink your drinks on Northgate and then head over to Kyle Field to see the band, you might even catch part of an SEC football game while you're there."
11278,Date of experience: October 2015,16-Aug-16,SEC,Texas,5,Love the new expansion...super fan-friendly!  The award-winning band rocks!,"We were able to get tickets via Auburn fans, who got them through their booster club...it was sold out locally.  Aggie students and fans were wonderful hosts - so friendly and helpful!  We were very impressed with facilities and the traditions.  Hope that we can get tickets for another game."
11279,Date of experience: August 2016,13-Aug-16,SEC,Texas,5,Doesn't get bigger than this,"It's huge, very well maintained and the people are unbelievably friendly. I'm not an Aggie so I don't have the sentimental attachment as many do- but I can see why they feel that way now."
11281,Date of experience: December 2015,4-Aug-16,SEC,Texas,5,Totally amazing place on any footgame game day,"It's hard to explain the feeling you get in this stadium.  We always sit opposite the 30,000+ student section so we get to hear their roars regularly.  The Cavalry parade, the band marching in, the halftime show of the band, everything is almost over the top.  Can't recommend this enough; though, I'd suggest coming later in the fall rather than in the August/September heat! I think tours are available at other times for visitors."
11286,Date of experience: November 2015,25-Jul-16,SEC,Texas,5,The new and improved Kyle Field is spectacular.,"Kyle Field was always a place for making memories and the newly renovated stadium is sure to help people make more.  Comfortable, easily accessible and there are absolutely no bad seats in the stadium.  It's a good place for families, couples, seniors and students alike.  For wonderful college football, Kyle Field and the Fightin' Texas Aggies are a sure bet."
11290,Date of experience: November 2015,7-Jul-16,SEC,Texas,5,Best Stadium in the World,Kyle Field is absolutely the best!!! It is beautiful and there is ample parking!! Plenty of restrooms too!! Great place to watch those Texas Aggies!!!!!
11293,Date of experience: September 2015,17-Jun-16,SEC,Texas,5,Nicest Football facility in the world!,"The newly remodeled Kyle Field is amazing to say the least.  There is not a bad seat in the house, the food is fantastic, and the game experience is as good as you will find anywhere in the U.S.  We have been to games all over..Notre Dame, Michigan, Rose Bowl, etc. and there is nothing that is as good as this one."
11294,Date of experience: October 2015,3-Jun-16,SEC,Texas,4,First game,This was a really cool football game and fun. They could clean up the bathrooms though. I can't wait to go back it was so fun last time
11297,Date of experience: September 2015,21-May-16,SEC,Texas,5,All of the college feels!,"I had the greatest time at Kyle Field!!! I went to the very first game here in the new renovated stadium and it was awesome. The tailgate, chants, the crowd, the atmosphere...it was the ultimate college experience. Afterwards the town and restaurants were packed with thousands of people from the game. I will be returning this year to hopefully see an A&M and bama game!"
11299,Date of experience: November 2015,10-May-16,SEC,Texas,5,Tradition,This is the most awesome stadium I have ever seen topped off by the traditions and fans! The seating is fantastic.  The food is really good. The big screens are unreal! I've been to Jerry World but this is more fun! Really enjoyed the art works too.
11301,Date of experience: December 2015,29-Apr-16,SEC,Texas,5,The Only Kyle Field,"If you're an Aggie, this is a spiritual experience.  If you're not, it's one of the best sports venues to experience in the world.  The students are unique, the military band is one-of-a-kind, and the football is always memorable.  If you are an American patriot, go to the military appreciation game, held every year.  President Bush, President Bush Jr, and Gov Rick Perry are usually there.  If you're not a patriot, go to Berkeley.  Kyle Field will also never be named after a billion-dollar corporation or any one of the donors or billionaire graduates of Texas A&M University, and none of those grads would even ask."
11302,Date of experience: September 2015,25-Apr-16,SEC,Texas,5,Amazing!,What a fabulous stadium!! No bad seat in the house! On the west side the first 6 rows have nice seats with upper rows having bench seats with backs. If you are in the upper rows for a couple dollars for rental you can get a cushion seat in the concourse. Easy return because you leave the seat where it is and they will pick it up! There is an air conditioned area concessions where you can get better than average food or a place to go into just for a quick cool off. If you want to ensure shade or inclement weather sit on the higher rows because you are under the cover of the press box BUT be aware that Kyle field is one of the loudest college stadiums but you can't go wrong with being a part of the Spirit of Aggieland!
11303,Date of experience: November 2015,24-Apr-16,SEC,Texas,5,Renovated Kyle Field- Best Football Stadium in America,"Texas A&M spent over $450 million remaking Kyle Field.  It now seats 102,500 with luxurious perks for the high rollers that donated big bucks for the privilege of sideline seats. This includes padded seats with armrests and cup holders with expansive private clubs under the seating areas where you can get mixed drinks, beer, and specialty food from the stadium caterer.  Suite holders are in a whole other upgraded universe.  Escalators to the seating areas, jumbo video board, etc., etc.  Great surrounding landscaping and pre-game activities.  Kyle Field has to be on your bucket list for the college football experience."
11309,Date of experience: November 2015,6-Apr-16,SEC,Texas,5,Black Out vs South Carolina,"1st time in College Station, there on our annual ""Football Weekend"", this was the 2nd SEC game I have attended and again it did not disappoint. The atmosphere is AWESOME, the A&M fans are great, friendly and love their team. If you are a College Football fan you MUST see a game here."
11310,Date of experience: December 2015,6-Apr-16,SEC,Texas,5,Love going to the ball games!,"Started working for the college two years ago, picked up season tickets, and have been having a blast going to the games.  The facility doesn't have a bad seat, traveling in and out of town is pretty painless (they have a great bus system set up), and everyone is very friendly, very refreshing from attending sporting events in the North for the last 20 years."
11311,Date of experience: November 2015,26-Mar-16,SEC,Texas,5,Home of the 12th Man,"Great football venue. I have to get use to it as it was not the Kyle Field I remember. Very nice, places to go to get cool or warm."
11312,Date of experience: September 2015,16-Mar-16,SEC,Texas,5,brand spankin new!,We love the new stadium and everything it has to offer College Station! The renovations are phenomenal. You must attend a game to feel the roar of the crowd and the Aggie spirit!
11313,Date of experience: November 2015,16-Mar-16,SEC,Texas,5,What spirit!,"It's always fun to take friends, who have never been to Kyle Field, to a football game to enjoy their reactions.  I'm partial to the Aggie Band, which is incredible!  Try to get there well before the game to take in all of the food offerings on the outside of the stadium."
11314,Date of experience: December 2015,11-Mar-16,SEC,Texas,5,Awesome place...,"Staduim is nice food not too over priced, games are great and even better when your a Aggie Fan!! Love College Station area, lots to see and do."
11315,Date of experience: November 2015,8-Mar-16,SEC,Texas,5,"Great people, beautiful stadium!","My wife and I travelled to Texas at the end of October to see the Gamecocks play the Aggies.  The highlight of our trip was the friendliness of the people of Texas and those at Kyle Field were no exception!  We spent two and a half days in Texas and never once ran into anything but nice people.  When we arrived at College Station, we parked a couple of miles from the stadium and rode a well organized shuttle bus to the stadium.  We were looking at the stadium, trying to chose the best place to enter to find out seats when and A&M student approached, recognized that we were USC fans and offered his help.  Instead of just pointing us in the right direction, he offered to guide us to our seat at the opposite corner of the stadium.  We were the only Gamecocks in the section where we were located but everyone there was friendly and we had good conversations with students and adults alike.Now to Kyle Field.  The stadium had just been renovated and they did a great job.  The thing that impressed us the most were the escalators!  We are in our mid to late 60s and they were a blessing -- escalators all the way to the top.  The stadium was loaded with security and the lines were orderly and moved quickly -- the whole setup was well organized.  Our view of the field was excellent and the Texas A&M band was outstanding -- do not miss the band if you attend a game there.  Stand in line later to get food and miss some football if you must, but do not miss the band!All in all, its a great place to watch a football game.  If you have the chance to see a game at Kyle Field, do not miss it.  This is a must do trip for all football fans."
11318,Date of experience: October 2015,8-Feb-16,SEC,Texas,5,Best in the Country!!,"Home of the Fightin' Texas Aggie football team!!  Best college football venue in the country - far surpasses even the fanciest equipped pro stadiums.  It's a must visit, provided you van get tickets.  Great place to see, even if you can't get inside the stadium proper."
11319,Date of experience: September 2015,31-Jan-16,SEC,Texas,5,"Home of the 12th Man, and recently updated!","Kyle is a fantastic place to watch a football game.  Not all the seats are great, but that's true in most stadiums and any stadium where you'll actually want to watch the home team play.  The updates have been great and were greatly needed.  The bathrooms were updated and so were the concessions.  Concession lines can still be long, but hopefully they improve between the 1st season post reno and season 2.  The fans are some of the nicest, most respectful in the entire country.  If you're a college football fan, Kyle Field needs to be on your bucket list."
11320,Date of experience: November 2015,13-Jan-16,SEC,Texas,5,Home of the 12th man,"The original and real 12th man. Sorry Seattle.Without a doubt the best place to watch a college football game. Not just because I love the school, but this is echoed from all visiting fans. One of the loudest and most intimidating arenas, while still maintaining one of the friendliest visits you will ever experience.Who can say anything bad about joining arm and arm and swaying while singing a fight song whether you know the person next too you or not. Whoop!"
11321,Date of experience: October 2015,12-Jan-16,SEC,Texas,5,An amazing place,"College football at its finest.  The team may win or they may be out scored but the true Aggies will stay until the end, standing to support the team.  I prefer the higher seats in the end zone to see the plays unfold.  Make certain to attend Midnight Yell the night before the game!"
11322,Date of experience: December 2015,28-Dec-15,SEC,Texas,5,Second Home,I love this place. It is always clean and fun. Tickets are pricy but you can get them cheaper or free if you wait by the gate. I love going to these sporting events.
11323,Date of experience: November 2015,12-Dec-15,SEC,Texas,5,Perhaps the Most Incredible College Stadium in the U.S.!,"This was our first trip to College Station and Kyle Field and it was really amazing (except for our hotel experience).  Kyle Field is simply beautiful and a place all Aggies should be proud.  I was a fan of the visiting team but could not get over the quality of Kyle Field.  The brick finish, the statues, the concession areas and the seating areas were way above anything else we've been.  Now we've been to some famous stadiums but none as well done as this place."
11324,Date of experience: November 2015,25-Nov-15,SEC,Texas,5,Symbol of the Aggie Spirit,A great stadium to be in while watching the Aggies BTHO their opponents. The yells performed by the students has the potential to give you goosebumps and also make you a fan of the 12th man.
11325,Date of experience: October 2015,24-Nov-15,SEC,Texas,5,12th Man,"What a classic place to watch a ballgame.  Just watching the yell leaders was fascinating in itself, but the Gamecock-Aggie ballgame was awesome!"
11326,Date of experience: November 2015,16-Nov-15,SEC,Texas,5,Coming hame again was easy,We attended Midnight Yell this year at the newly rennovated stadium. This was a great experience. Make sure to park at the Alumni center as it is a short walk on a well lighted path. My wife and inhad a zllion memories to share with our kids. Gig 'Em Aggies!
11327,Date of experience: November 2015,15-Nov-15,SEC,Texas,5,Beautiful stadium and friendly fans,Being an avid Auburn fan I was unsure about attending the midnight yell practice! Other than the Auburn jokes (all in good fun) it was such an awesome experience! Every one was soooo friendly! Can't say the same for so many of the other SEC campuses I have traveled too. The next da we headed back to Kyle Field this time with our 6 year old in tow! The extra smaller screens were a great addition! The stadium is super clean and once again the fans are so nice!
11328,Date of experience: October 2015,15-Nov-15,SEC,Texas,4,Great game-time atmosphere & some interesting food choices,"Experiencing an Aggies home game at Kyle Field is an absolute must.  The traditional cheers (the Aggie War Hymn is truly special), the deafening crowd noise when the 104,000 seat stadium is full (home of the original 12th man!) and the Fightin' Texas Aggie Band half time performance are alone worth a visit.  The stadium recently underwent a $450m+ renovation which brought it into the 21st century with WiFi and more spacious public areas.The size of the stadium is perhaps its biggest drawback in terms of accessibility.  There are a series of escalators that can bring you near the top (but only from the main entrance) but otherwise you are relegated to perhaps the longest walk anywhere as you ascend very gradual sloping ramps to the upper levels.  You also can't access many areas of the stadium or get completely around the lower levels as they are blocked off for premiums seats and suites.As with most large stadiums the food options are relatively boring - burgers, pizza, hotdogs, fries, etc.  However, keep your eyes open for small pop-up kiosks that sell unique Texas items such as Frito pie - well worth it.  And if you're thirsty for some cold beer, drink up before entering the stadium as it is alcohol free."
11329,Date of experience: September 2015,13-Nov-15,SEC,Texas,4,Quite an experience,"My wife and I are not Aggies, but we enjoy supporting them when we get tickets. The multi-million dollar rebuild of the stadium is quite impressive. Our only game this year was the opening game and there were several wrinkles that needed to be ironed out - too few ticket scanners at our gate & concession stand ran out of diet soft drinks before the end of the FIRST quarter! The big screens are incredible, & most sight lines are good. Big time college football is an experience that you will never forget in Kyle Field"
11331,Date of experience: September 2015,10-Nov-15,SEC,Texas,5,Best football in the USA,This is the best football experience in the nation; in my opinion.  The experience of the 12th Man is like no other; the stadium recently underwent a 4.5 million dollar renovation that makes it state of the art.
11333,Date of experience: November 2015,9-Nov-15,SEC,Texas,5,Must See Venues of College Football,"It's big. It's beautiful. It's well laid out with bathrooms and amenities. The wifi is screaming fast.  And the people and traditions are second to none in college football. As an opposing fan, people were great and friendly.  Good natured teasing went both ways.  The traditions give me hope for our future leaders.  These fans deserve a better football team."
11334,Date of experience: November 2015,9-Nov-15,SEC,Texas,4,Very good football field,"First trip here to the see the Aggies play and they have a great stadium. Very good choices of food available and normally high game-day prices. (C&J BBQ was delicious!!!!-upper deck, SE corner)."
11335,Date of experience: November 2015,6-Nov-15,SEC,Texas,5,Auburn v. Texas A&M,"First time ever to visit TAMU.  The Corp of Cadets was running down PT all over campus.  Everyone must undergo this event their gist two years.  Friendly folks everywhere.  Kyle Field is brand new, big, and totally fantastic!  Wow! Welcome to the SEC!!!"
11336,Date of experience: October 2015,5-Nov-15,SEC,Texas,5,Extremly welcoming to the opposing fans,"Living in Columbia, SC you have to be a Gamecock.  We decided to visit a friend who is an Aggie and watch A&M play SC.The stadium is amazing and the pageantry and atmosphere of the Corps of Cadets and student body was wonderful.But, what made my day was the welcoming atmosphere of the students and fans.  Wearing Gamecock garnet and black for the game made me nervous, but I had no fear.  Multiple people walked up to me all day to shake my hand and welcome me to Kyle Field.  Fans in other cities should emulate A&M!"
11337,Date of experience: October 2015,4-Nov-15,SEC,Texas,5,"""First Class Must See""","The renovation of Kyle Field is totally first class and a must see for anyone visiting the Brazos Valley. You don't have to be an Aggie to appreciate the Hall of Champions. If you don't admire the dedication and work of college athletes, you will after touring this collection. The technology used in the exhibits make it fascinating to kids as well as adults. Fun to watch a photo of an athlete or coach and see someone walk up behind the bigger than life photo and get their picture taken standing by the ""famous person."" If you are lucky enough to attend an Aggie game, you can count on friendly hosts to help you find whatever you need, be it restroom, escalator, or your seat. And the food in the All American Club is exceptional! Well done, Texas A&M!"
11338,Date of experience: November 2015,2-Nov-15,SEC,Texas,5,Most exciting atmosphere and experience for college football!,"I wasn't the biggest fan of attending football games (actually, I wasn't a fan much at all) until I came to A&M... Especially ever since the new architectural design that changed the entire stadium itself, this place rocks. The alabama game is a must-go-see if you are to attend at least one!"
11339,Date of experience: October 2015,1-Nov-15,SEC,Texas,5,Fun experience even if you're not an Aggie,Bring lots of money for  food and drinks. Bag check - Check their website to see what you're allowed to bring in. Padded seats available for rent.
11342,Date of experience: October 2015,25-Oct-15,SEC,Texas,5,Non-game weekend visit,Was I'm College station with family to visit my daughter and her family.  We had been to a few games before the stadium renovations so we decided to drive over and get a good look.  The outside of the stadium looks fantastic and it is massive.  I was very impressed.  Can't wait to be back for a game.
11343,Date of experience: October 2015,22-Oct-15,SEC,Texas,5,I love this place,"I'm a Former Student so I'm biased and just love Kyle Field.  Aggie fans, and the Spirit of Aggie Land are as great as ever, but it's definitely not the same stadium it was when I started in 1979. The new stadium is very well done, and it's a real pleasure to watch a game here.  There isn't a bad seat in the house (even though some of them are pretty high....), and the game day experience is great.There are many fun things to do outside before the game - walk around Spence Park to see some cool tailgating, visit the Aggie Fan Zone, watch the Band and Corp of Cadets march into Kyle Field before the game.If you can - go watch a game and enjoy the experience."
11345,Date of experience: October 2015,20-Oct-15,SEC,Texas,5,"Great Stadium, great fans",Loved going to a football game here. Great stadium even for visitors. The A&M fans are a class act. We went to the Alabama game (we're AL fans) and were treated extremely well.
11346,Date of experience: September 2015,18-Oct-15,SEC,Texas,5,It's HUGE!,"It's definitely not the Kyle Field of the 80s and 90s. Buying tickets to an Aggie football game isn't the same either. But the Aggie Spirit hasn't changed a bit! Everyone needs to experience it for themselves. Be sure to get to games early enough to see march in. Recently took the teens to their first Aggie game when A&M  played UNR. Bought tickets using Flash Seats. I didn't realize that you don't get an actual TICKET. Instead, you scan your credit card at the gate and then they give you the ticket. (Kinda scarey when you're traveling over 2,000 miles to get there.) The only reason I mention this is because we couldn't get into the Hall of Champions without a game ticket. So, we decided we would go to it after the game. However, they close the Hall of Champions for two hours after games, so we didn't get a chance to go."
11347,Date of experience: October 2015,18-Oct-15,SEC,Texas,4,Nice stadium.....exiting was a bit nerve racking.,"Nice stadium...sat in Section 346, 3rd row.  Great view for Bama versus Aggies....Bama won!  View was great and I like the end zone, so I can see the plays develop.  The only knock on the stadium is when the game was over, exiting down the ramps was a little nerve-racking, due to the SE side walk ways not being able to handle such a mass exodus.  It came to a standstill a number of times, which leads me to believe that there must be something holding people up near to the bottom.  We ended up going to the north end of the stadium and exiting there.  There were escalators on that end of the stadium.  Crowd was great and the Aggies have great spirit, traditions and are very loud.  A very fun experience."
11348,Date of experience: October 2015,18-Oct-15,SEC,Texas,5,Newly remodeled excellence,"Great place to watch a spirited student body cheer on the Aggies.  Very well done and needed changes, great food services, clean and great choices.  Fun day of football here"
11349,Date of experience: October 2015,17-Oct-15,SEC,Texas,5,Midnight Yell,"We are the Aggies, the Aggies are we...The spirit of Aggieland cannot be easily described. But to just get a quick glimpse of it, go to midnight yell before a home game. You can just feel it. I haven't been in almost 20 years. But when I went this weekend, the yells quickly return to my mind and the songs easily flowed out of my mouth. It's just something you never forget. For those not familiar, it is still a memorable event to attend. The new revamped stadium is incredible!"
11350,Date of experience: September 2015,16-Oct-15,SEC,Texas,4,What a great stadium!,We had a wonderful (albeit WARM) time attending a football game at this wonderful stadium.  Nothing like Aggie spirit!  The 12th man really does appear strong!
11351,Date of experience: September 2015,14-Oct-15,SEC,Texas,5,Amazing new stadium,"The new stadium is beautiful and brings lots of comfort and extras to it! If you want to experience a game of football, this is the stadium to do it in!"
11352,Date of experience: October 2015,14-Oct-15,SEC,Texas,5,BEST STADIUM in Texas and the SEC!!!,The picture needs to be updated.  Since the renovation the stadium is louder than ever.  It is amazing to be inside and listen to the 12th Man yell!!!
11353,Date of experience: September 2015,10-Oct-15,SEC,Texas,5,Some May Boast of Prowess Bold,"Kyle Field has undergone a $485 Million dollar renovation over the past 20 months increasing the capacity from about 84k to about 104k. We were there on September 19th for the game against Nevada.  They made it so that you can walk the entire stadium inside connecting the North, East, South and West sides, turning it into a Mecca for college football players and fans.  The statues added around the stadium as well as architecture make it a facility that is both imposing and beautiful to the eyes.  If you get a chance to take in a game there????do it.  Sight lines are great as well as the use of lights and sounds to enhance your game experience.I would highly recommend families going to this stadium to watch some awesome football.  Everyone was extremely friendly."
11355,Date of experience: September 2015,29-Sep-15,SEC,Texas,5,There's a Spirit Can Ne'er Be Told in Kyle Field,"The photo for this site needs to be replaced.  The new Kyle Field is absolutely out of this World.  Having been in the Aggie Band from 1965-1969 and marching there many times, I can say that this stadium doesn't even remotely resemble the old Kyle Field.  I anticipate some national championships being won there in the future.  The facilities, and the experience just blows you away.  If you have never attended an Texas A&M football game in Kyle Field, put this on your bucket list.  It is the finest college stadium in the nation and seats nearly 103,000 fans.  The noise level when the opposing team has the ball is unreal.  It is an exciting and enthusiastic place to be on game day.  And, if you want to see a midnight yell practice the night before where 40,000 people come to build their spirits before the big game, be sure to add that to your bucket list.  It's unreal."
11356,Date of experience: September 2015,29-Sep-15,SEC,Texas,5,What's not to like?,"This is the most amazing college football stadium I have ever seen.  Not only is it beautiful but even the new seats are broad enough to be comfortable. The food is still ""stadium food"" so don't go expecting anything gourmet, even in the Zone club. If you like BBQ and nachos, you'll be happy enough. Exciting place to watch the Aggies win!"
11357,Date of experience: September 2015,29-Sep-15,SEC,Texas,5,Great facility,What a site!  You can see this from anywhere on campus!   The team was not playing at home when we visited.  We will definitely come back for a game.
11358,Date of experience: August 2015,28-Sep-15,SEC,Texas,5,Overwhelming !,"Rebuilt. renewed, enlarged. Better than ever.Noisy! I used to go here when it was a single level horseshoe"
11359,Date of experience: September 2015,23-Sep-15,SEC,Texas,5,Great Atmosphere!!,"We visited there this weekend for the Nevada game. The atmosphere is classic! Everyone should see an Aggie game there in person. The male cheerleaders were amazing as so were the student sections. We purchased tickets in the SHADE off Flash seats. There were awesome in the KZone with AC, bar etc.Hope to visit it again in the future!"
11360,Date of experience: September 2015,16-Sep-15,SEC,Texas,5,Great Stadium,I think everything looks new here or they just remodeled it. It looks awesome now. Parking a bit problem

11362,Date of experience: September 2015,14-Sep-15,SEC,Texas,5,All I can say is WOW !!!,"Visited Kyle Field for the inaugural game in 2015 versus Ball State, I was astonished with the stadium.  Very nice, screens look awesome in HD ! Crowd noise now stays inside the stadium,  Kyle Field will be a huge advantage for the Aggies. The only thing missing is selling BEER, not the same going to a football game and not drinking. Also need to change the bleacher type seating. Need to upgrade to individual seats."
11363,Date of experience: September 2015,13-Sep-15,SEC,Texas,2,TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE AT KYLE FIELD,Season ticket holders for several years.  Opening day of Kyle Field was supposed to be amazing.  VERY DISAPPOINTING!

We purchased season tickets and attended nearly every game, including the wild opening game in Sept 2014 when the weather was impossibly hot and then the thunder and lightning rolled in and the game was delayed HOURS.   Despite all that - there is simply nothing that can compare to attending an Aggie football game.  The students are loud and crazy.  The football team thrives on the noise.  The Yell Leaders are running from sideline to sideline in constant motion to whip up the frenzy.  Miss Reveille is usually the only calm one in attendance.   While the crowd is swaying and sawing off varsity's horns, the stadium actually shakes/moves.   CAN. NOT. WAIT. for 2015 season which starts in 10 days to witness the fully redeveloped Kyle field with the Old Ag (west) side finished, a new field, and the plaza surrounding Kyle Field finished.   Gig 'Em Aggies!"

11397,Date of experience: January 2014,23-Dec-14,SEC,Texas,1,Imploded the stadium in December,"Not much to see at present. Will be in rebuild for a couple of years, but all the tradition is gone. Just another fancy college stadium with luxury boxes. When it comes to tradition versus luxury boxes, the luxury boxes always win."
11398,Date of experience: October 2014,3-Dec-14,SEC,Texas,5,WHOOP!,"Kyle Field has always held the best traditions of any college football field, and the newly renovated stadium is no different. There is truly no bad seat in the stands and the new escalators help to move people faster and with less strain and stress."
11399,Date of experience: November 2014,30-Nov-14,SEC,Texas,3,Definitely not in the Top 20 of college stadiums,"Parking is pretty good around the stadium and tailgating is excellent.  However, food, seats, signage, and space in the stadium is lacking. You stand the entire time - awful.  Why even have bleacher seats?  Fans are very friendly and hospitable."
11401,Date of experience: November 2014,23-Nov-14,SEC,Texas,5,Better than expected,"This is a great football stadium.  Area is well organized, clean.  Nov2014 was in middle of stadium makeover, but no impact on the experience.  We sat in the North End, excellent view of the field and the new scoreboard.  We used park and ride to get to the game, it's hassle free, and free!Tailgating very social.  Only complaint was that the majority of seats are on a bench, so if you want a back rest, buy a cheap seat back to clamp to the seat."
11402,Date of experience: November 2014,19-Nov-14,SEC,Texas,1,Unorganized and poorly run,The place is undergoing construction and not one person that worked there could give us directions.   clueless crew and staff!   Everything including our seats were difficult to find.   Then they blocked off critical exits so we were stuck walking miles out of the way in pouring rain.
11403,Date of experience: November 2014,19-Nov-14,SEC,Texas,5,No place like it anywhere!,"Everyone must have a game at Kyle Field on their bucket list, especially with all the new changes that were made in the spring/summer of 2014."
11404,Date of experience: October 2014,3-Nov-14,SEC,Texas,5,The Aggies have done a great job!,"Many will comment on the scale of the new Kyle field (according to Wikipedia: now the third largest non-racing stadium in the US).  It is amazing though that despite being in such a huge stadium that you feel closely tied into the action on the field and not just lost in a crowd.  Even at a well attended game, I found it easy to park, grab a shuttle to the stadium (though we walked, because we wanted to), and to get back to our car afterwards.  The fans are able to move efficiently through the maze of tunnels and passages even if you waited for the game to end to wait to leave.  I don't know how they did it, but while I knew I was in a crowd and in heavy ""traffic"", I never felt like I was in a traffic jam.  They did a great job."
11405,Date of experience: October 2014,3-Nov-14,SEC,Texas,3,Overrated,"I have to admit I'm not a football fan, but the hullabaloo about Kyle Field is overrated. The games are great for the economy, but the traffic in town and around the stadium is horrible."
11406,Date of experience: October 2014,20-Oct-14,SEC,Texas,5,Always Fun,Love this place!!  Great times with great people!  I love attending games here.........Cant beat the Aggie Howdy!!
11407,Date of experience: October 2014,18-Oct-14,SEC,Texas,5,"Largest crowd ever, but handled efficiently.","As an Ole Miss fan in Aggieland I was amazed at the wonderful experience at Kyle field.  The free shuttle made arriving at the stadium and getting back to our car unbelievably easy.  Kudos to the Aggie fans, they were very gracious.  Also the Fighting Texas Aggie band put on an amazing half time show.  Fantastic venue.  Don't miss this experience!"
11408,Date of experience: October 2014,15-Oct-14,SEC,Texas,4,What a Thrill,"I just love the tradition, respect and honor.  The students are polite , intelligent and respectful.  My knees are bothering me so climbing to row 20 in the student section and standing the whole game was tough but just watching the Aggie band at halftime was worth it, especially since Ole Miss kicked our butt."
11409,Date of experience: October 2014,15-Oct-14,SEC,Texas,5,Nice stadium,Attended a football game at Kyle Field as a visiting fan. The experience was a very nice one and the Texas A&M fans were extremely friendly. Would highly recommend attending an away game at Texas A&M if you are an avid football fan.
11410,Date of experience: October 2014,13-Oct-14,SEC,Texas,5,Ole Miss Wins!!,"Great atmosphere!  110,000 of my closest friends.  Love the band!  Need more port-a-potties in the tailgating area."
11411,Date of experience: October 2014,13-Oct-14,SEC,Texas,5,Awesome,"The redesign is awesome....packed 110k+ in for Ole Miss game.  Though we lost badly, will be back  next year to see Kyle Field in end state."
11412,Date of experience: September 2014,7-Oct-14,SEC,Texas,5,Greatest Football Atmosphere Anywhere!,"The stadium has the best and loudest student section in the USA. Definitely a must see. 102,500 can attend the games."
11413,Date of experience: October 2013,29-Sep-14,SEC,Texas,5,Home of the 12th Man,"I love this place! Can't wait until the renovations are done too, going to be even better! This is one of the greatest places in all of college football to watch a game. The crowd is fabulous and supports the team no matter what."
11414,Date of experience: September 2014,23-Sep-14,SEC,Texas,5,Awesome Fan Experience at the New Stadium,"I didn't have the opportunity to take in the stadium in its former incarnation, but the upgraded Kyle Field looks better than many of the newer pro stadiums I have visited.  The statues on the outside of the stadium commemorating Aggie lore and the huge new video scoreboard inside of it are great additions that also add to the ""big league feel"" that A&M's administration appears to be going for now that aTm is in the SEC.  I personally feel that it helps get all of the SEC fans that come through a quick refresher on the A&M brand and its heritage.  I had seats in the lower bowl of Kyle Field's newly constructed south end zone and I thought that the stadium still had an intimate feel despite there being more than 100,000 other fans at the game.  Outside of the game, you have to stay for the marching band's halftime performance, which got nearly as many cheers as the football team."
11415,Date of experience: September 2014,16-Sep-14,SEC,Texas,5,Loud!!!,"Love the new stadium....very loud now that it is fully enclosed. Although, I have to admit that it has lost a little of its former charm."
11416,Date of experience: September 2014,10-Sep-14,SEC,Texas,5,The new stadium is great,"It's great that they have escalators (finally!) and the new scoreboard and sound system are amazing. I have friends who live nearby to Kyle field and they tell me it lights up the whole sky and they can hear everything. The food prices have gotten crazy though, more expensive than a Texans game."
11417,Date of experience: September 2014,9-Sep-14,SEC,Texas,5,The New Stadium!,The stadium looks great with the renovations.  The new end zone side is the one with the most sun --I would pick the old one next time to get a little more shade.
11418,Date of experience: September 2014,7-Sep-14,SEC,Texas,3,Great advances in modernization - not prepared for the crowd,"We visited the newly phase 1 renovated Kyle Field over the weekend for a football game.  It was the largest crowd in the history of the stadium with over 100,000 fans.  I was reluctant to attend since the seats we were offered were in the SE corner, at 6:00 pm in Texas September, knowing we'd be staring the hottest part of the sun in the face for the first couple hours.  However, I was curious to see what it was like sitting in the new section that boasts more leg room since our season tickets next year will be in the same section.  I figured it would be an easy experience since it was a game against a small school, and the blowout would allow us to leave early.  Our tailgate was close to the stadium entrance, so we waited until about 5:45 to start heading toward our entrance.  Based on past experience, it's relatively organized and quick to get inside.  Boy, was that a bad assumption for this game!  Apparently the phase 1 renovation left only 1 entrance to funnel in both the entire student section (the whole East side of the stadium) AND the new alumni Southeast section.  We had to fight through the crowd of drunken 18-20 year olds, which was a massive slew of chaotic line. We waited for over 30 minutes in line and made sure we weren't in the line with signs that said, ""no bags, express line"" since I was carrying a purse with me (no information went out about more strict bag rules).  However, after standing in that line, we were told that anyone with a bag needed to go to the other line that was twice as long as the line we stood in for 30 minutes.  This is how your treat your ALUMNI????  I was so shocked because Texas A&M is known for it's politeness.  I would have expected there would be clear communication and orderly logistics. Not the case.We finally made our way through the crowds and up to the top deck.  There were no water fountains in sight, and extremely hot, sweaty and out of breath, I waited in line at the water stand while my husband ran to catch the kick-off.  I made it up in time for the swaying and just as kick-off was about to happen, they called severe weather delay. We sat there for about an hour or so watching the bad weather get closer and closer before finally deciding to throw in the towel on this game and head back to the tailgate.   PS - I really hope they install a new jumbotron at the other end of the field because I couldn't make out anything in the tiny screen across from us.  (We were sitting under the big original jumbotron.)As we were leaving with our chairs and ice chest from the tailgate, we heard the announcement that the game was coming back on in 15-20 minutes.  Oh well.  Too late now, and no way we're going through all that hassle to get back in and up to our seats. Don't think I'll be returning again this year. Too unorganized and poorly planned.  Hopefully after phase 2, next year's experience will be better."
11419,Date of experience: August 2014,4-Sep-14,SEC,Texas,5,Looking good,The new Kyle Field is going to be an outstanding venue to watch our Aggies play football! The architectural  design is beautiful and adds class to our campus.
11420,Date of experience: November 2013,23-Aug-14,SEC,Texas,5,Best stadium in the country!,I have been to this stadium many times. The people are kind and the stadium has a very exciting atmosphere. I highly recommend going to a game there.
11421,Date of experience: October 2013,18-Aug-14,SEC,Texas,5,Nothing like an Aggie Football Game,"Whoop! Nothing like being at an Aggie Football game. With the remodel of the stadium, it should be a great football season!"
11422,Date of experience: August 2014,9-Aug-14,SEC,Texas,4,football !,nice stadium on a rare lush green campus (its august and in Texas) we couldn't go inside as there was nothing going on but it was impressive anyway. Maybe we can return and see a game
11425,Date of experience: November 2013,1-Jul-14,SEC,Texas,5,"Greatest place to watch College Football, period!","Unique and amazing atmosphere for a college football game.  The Aggies are a friendly bunch, that will say Howdy to you and then invite you into their tailgate to share some food, cold beer, and great Texas hospitality.  The pomp and circumstance surrounding a gameday at Kyle Field is unlike anywhere else in the country, you have to experience it for yourself!"
11426,Date of experience: November 2013,30-Jun-14,SEC,Texas,5,GIG EM AGGIES!,"Best venue in the nation for College Football!  Home of ESPN game day and Johnny Football, Heisman Trophy Winner. HOME OF the REAL one and only 12th man!"
11428,Date of experience: August 2013,22-Jun-14,SEC,Texas,5,Under construction,Whilst visiting the University I went by Kyle's field.  It was under construction.  I've been watching the updates online.  It will be exciting to see what it looks like when it's complete.
11430,Date of experience: October 2013,22-May-14,SEC,Texas,5,One of the best in college football!,This is by far one of the best venues in all of college football. If you are a fan of Texas A&M or just football in general you have to see a game from the stands of Kyle field! You can actually feel the energy in the stadium every home game! A must see for any trip to Aggieland!
11433,Date of experience: November 2013,15-Apr-14,SEC,Texas,5,Best Place to Watch Football,Everything is wonderful about Kyle Field!  It will be even better this fall when all the new seats are added.
11434,Date of experience: September 2013,14-Apr-14,SEC,Texas,5,Greatest Place to watch a College Football Game,Title says it all. It's something you have to experience at least once in your lifetime.Be sure to get there early and make a day of it. There's tons of vendors and goings-on in the zone plaza right in front of the stadium. Watch Spirit Walk and then go to the quad and watch the Corps step off. Check out the MSC.
11435,Date of experience: October 2013,24-Mar-14,SEC,Texas,5,Best Atmosphere for Football!,"Aggies, and non-Aggies, agree on one thing: Kyle Field is an AWESOME place to see a game! The area is set up for a family friendly event, with attractions and fun for every age. The food is plentiful, well-priced and easy to get to. There are a TON of people, but everything flows well. You don't feel overwhelmed even with 90,000+ other fans. The parking can be a bit confusing, so look it up on the Aggie Athletics website before you go. There is no doubt you will have friendly people to ask for help if you need it. Go early and watch the Corps march in, the football team enter or meet other Aggie teams in front of Kyle. You can learn a bit about the ""Aggie Spirit"" just by watching those around you in the stands, or by visiting the MSC (Memorial Student Center) across from Kyle. Follow the ""Yell Leaders"" to get dunked in the ""Fish Pond"" if the Aggies win and see what team pride is all about. A great place, that own't disappoint... even if Johnny Football has moved on."
11438,Date of experience: September 2013,18-Feb-14,SEC,Texas,5,Best football environment there is,"Best football environment there is, college or pro.  Even if you are not an Aggie fan taking in the atmosphere is a must for any football fan.  Very loud, passionate fan base.  Can't wait to go back after the redovelopement  of Kyle Field is complete!"
11439,Date of experience: November 2013,21-Jan-14,SEC,Texas,4,The old concrete lady,"Now that the renovations are underway, this review is probably moot...but the atmosphere for a game here won't change, and that atmosphere is amazing. Don't discount the 12th Man: they can make this place rock and feel at home.The student side is a concrete shell...but new renovations might be changing that. Guess you'll have to come back real soon!"
11440,Date of experience: December 2013,2-Jan-14,SEC,Texas,5,Part of the Heart of Aggie Tradition,"This is where the Aggies play! The view is incredible, the games are incredible, everything is awesome! However.. it is undergoing construction, so SOMEHOW it will be even better when it's opened back up."
11441,Date of experience: October 2013,22-Dec-13,SEC,Texas,5,Gig 'me Aggies,"This was one of the greatest fields I have been to, and the fan base is the most active of any of them!"
11442,Date of experience: November 2013,9-Dec-13,SEC,Texas,5,Nothing better than Kyle Field on a Saturday,Kyle Field is one of the most electrifying stadiums in football. Definitely a must visit if you are an Aggie fan or just a fan of football.
11443,Date of experience: November 2013,25-Nov-13,SEC,Texas,5,Going to an Aggie game!,"The University is renovating Kyle Field now, so that by 2015 it'll have WiFi and seat 102,000. But it isn't just the stadium that makes an Aggie game such an experience. Visitors are made to feel welcome like no other college town I've ever seen. Come not just for the game, but for the atmosphere and sights! Enjoy tailgating and real Texas BBQ."
11444,Date of experience: October 2013,25-Nov-13,SEC,Texas,5,No Place Like This on Gameday,"Where else can you get 35,000 college students to do exactly the same thing at the same time.  The noise is deafening, but the atmosphere is friendly and welcoming.  Kyle Field must be experienced to be believed."
11445,Date of experience: November 2013,25-Nov-13,SEC,Texas,5,Great Game Day Experience,"I have season tickets to all Texas A&M Aggie home football games.  There is no other place quite like Kyle Field on game day.  It is packed, it is very loud, and the spirit is extremely high.  The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band is worth the price of admission alone.  Now that we're in the SEC, the competition is tougher, and the excitement level is much higher.  The Corps of Cadets always have a pre-game march-in and review,  The stadium is presently undergoing a $450 million facelift, and will be the largest one in Texas and the SEC when it's done at 102,500.  Come enjoy a super game day experience with the 12th Man."
11446,Date of experience: November 2013,12-Nov-13,SEC,Texas,3,Old and uncomfortable,"Of course that's a sac religious comment on the home of the Fighting Aggies. However as of late November 2013 that old, uncomfortable stadium is being demolished and a new multi-million dollar stadium being built to replace it. The final home game was played there November 9, 2013 and construction has already been underway in an attempt to have it completed by the 2014 football season. Some of the college alumni have donated or pitched in millions of dollars to support the new construction."
11447,Date of experience: November 2013,5-Nov-13,SEC,Texas,5,No place like Kyle Field on Saturday,"Tradition is on display most Saturdays during the fall. If you haven't experienced a game in Kyle Field then you have truly missed one of the special places in college football. From the corps march in, to Sawing Varsity's Horns Off, the old place rocks on Saturday during SEC conference play. Tailgating has become a sport of its own in College Station, so come early and stay late and cheer the Aggies on to victory."
11448,Date of experience: October 2013,28-Oct-13,SEC,Texas,4,Great Atmosphere,Went to see the Auburn vs A&M game and enjoyed the game and Kyle field immensely.   I enjoyed watching the cadets march in and the horses and Revely the dog.  Even though I had my Auburn shirt on all the A&M fans were very hospitable.  A&M has a lot of great traditions and cheers.  I was amazed at how hard the Yell leaders worked during the game too.  Auburn winning was just the icing on the cake.
11449,Date of experience: October 2013,21-Oct-13,SEC,Texas,5,Great Game Day experience,"Just got back from a great game at Kyle Field this weekend and I must say that despite the age of the stadium, this was a phenomenal experience.  We went down for Midnight Yell on Friday and then to the game on Saturday.The fans of T A&M are first class...nicest and most hospitable I have ever experienced.The 12th Man lives up to it reputation, you could feel the place sway when the whole place locked arms and swayed back and forth."
11450,Date of experience: September 2013,8-Oct-13,SEC,Texas,5,The best stadium in College Station,One of the best stadium in TX. All football game of TAMU. The price of tickets are very reasonable. From 60 to 80 per game.
11451,Date of experience: September 2013,8-Oct-13,SEC,Texas,5,Whoop!,"Fabulous facility, fabulous team, fabulous fans!  Everyone should experience a Texas A&M game.  Friendly people who slap hands and say ""Howdy"" a lot."
11452,Date of experience: September 2013,30-Sep-13,SEC,Texas,5,Bama Game!,"Loved the people.  They have a very unusual spirit that radiates throughout the stadium.  When 50,000 people get together at midnight before a big game for cheer practice, you know they love their team and support their school.  Awesome experience!"
11453,Date of experience: November 2012,21-Sep-13,SEC,Texas,5,A great college football experience,"There are few things like getting to experience the excitement of college football and the spirit of the students and fans of Texas A&M than being able to be inside, or near, Kyle Field on game day. The atmosphere is electric and the people are great."
11454,Date of experience: September 2013,18-Sep-13,SEC,Texas,5,"Beautiful Campus, Friendly Folks",Nice place to visit. If we had more time we would have spent more there. The walk across campus was very pleasing.
11455,Date of experience: September 2013,16-Sep-13,SEC,Texas,5,Fantastic game day experience,Kyle Field needs the coming renovations but even before those are in place it is a unique venue. Tailgating outside the stadium is awesome. The crowd is totally into the games. The fans are so friendly and nice!Cannot wait to come back when the improvements to the facility are in place!
11456,Date of experience: August 2013,4-Sep-13,SEC,Texas,5,An Amazing History,"If you ever get the chance, take a look at old photo's of a Kyle Field that consisted of one short stack of wooden bleachers. I went through the University in the 1980's so there are many fond memories of the look, the smell, the crowds, the games, midnight yell... To see the grand plans of a historic upgrade to the old facility is sadly magnificent. Kyle Field is always what you remember but I see a grand brilliance to her long-term future."
11457,Date of experience: January 2013,27-Aug-13,SEC,Texas,5,How could it not be a 5?,"It's Kyle Field, and what a great football year it was. Read the history around the building - cannot wait for football season to come again:)"
11459,Date of experience: November 2012,30-Jul-13,SEC,Texas,4,Football at Kyle Field!,"Football games at Kyle Field are awesome!  I've attended many over the years.  The stadium architecture is nothing special, but the game day atmosphere is electric!  If you have tickets on the east side of the stadium, this is the student side.  Be warned that the students remain standing during the entire game.  They only sit down for the portion of halftime that the Aggie band is not on the field.  The students also do many coordinated yells that are communicated by hand signals that they hold up so the fans behind them can see.  Fans on the west (alumni) side and in ""The Zone"" (north end zone) do sit during the games.  Aggie fans are normally polite and friendly.  The Zone is the newest part of the stadium and has the most legroom, newest restrooms, and best variety of concessions (pizza rolls, glazed pecans, snow cones, etc).  Of course, it is harder to tell the yardage from there, but you do have a good view of the jumbotron screen in the south end zone.  Armchair seats on the west side are prime seats with a great view, but the legroom is very tight for anyone 5' 10"" or taller.  The restrooms on the east and west sides are very basic and outdated.  Aggie fans are looking forward to the upcoming stadium renovations.  I recommend wearing comfortable walking shoes to the games.  The limited elevators are normally used by fans with mobility issues, so expect to walk up the ramps to get to the 2nd and 3rd decks.  If you are attending an afternoon game in early September, expect it to be hot and sunny.  Wear sunscreen.  Current policies allow fans to bring a bottle of water into the stadium.  Alcohol is not permitted and neither are strollers.  Bring a poncho if rain is in the forecast because umbrellas are not allowed.  Cell phone access during games seemed much improved this year.  More game day information is available at:  http://www.aggieathletics.com/ViewArticle.dbml?&DB_OEM_ID=27300&ATCLID=205438292.Arrive early to experience the good food and festivities in the Fan Zone outside the north end of the stadium.  But be in your seats in time to watch the pre-game flyover.  Enjoy the game and this great college football venue!"
11461,Date of experience: August 2012,29-Jul-13,SEC,Texas,5,Aggie spirit is something to experience!,"Attending an Aggie football game is something to experience.  The inspired traditions are something to see!  And the Aggie football team never disappoints--playing a great game, win or lose."
11462,Date of experience: November 2012,29-Jul-13,SEC,Texas,5,Best college game day in America,"Can't beat Kyle Field with 90,000 plus yelling fans for an SEC football game. Great pregame atmosphere with plenty of street food.  Try the local sausage.  The Fighting Texas Aggie Band wins every halftime.  The stadium is old so facilities are limited inside.  However, in 2015 an essentially new 102,500 seat stadium will be opened on the same ground with top of the line amenities and private clubs."
11465,Date of experience: November 2012,16-Jul-13,SEC,Texas,5,"Not just a game experience, but an adventure","Experience the pomp of the Aggie Band, the roar of the crowd, the boom of the howitzer.  A unique college football experience that you'll never forget.Opposing fans may get ribbed, but it won't be too bad, and won't cross into assault.  Fans are pretty respectful of opposing fans provided you're not obnoxiously disrespectful.Its a cattle-call when exiting the upper decks, just so you know."
11466,Date of experience: November 2012,3-Jul-13,SEC,Texas,4,"Great, even for a UT fan","I'm a Longhorn fan, though not alumnus, and I prefer watching a game at Kyle Field.  Fans are respectful and into the game.  Watching games at UT basically sucks by comparison."
11467,Date of experience: November 2012,7-Jun-13,SEC,Texas,4,Whoop!! Go Aggies!,Midnight yell practice before the Thanksgiving day game!! For my teens that are wannabe Aggies -- they had a blast.  And the games (if you can get affordable tickets...or go with a student) are a blast as long as you understand you will be STANDING the entire game...welcome to TAMU traditions!
11472,Date of experience: September 2012,5-Mar-13,SEC,Texas,4,Nice Venue,"The fans are great, but boy do they sure spell a lot.  It would have been great if my boys would have won, but the TAMU fans didn't rub it in too much."
11473,Date of experience: October 2012,25-Jan-13,SEC,Texas,5,Only getting better........,"Best atmosphere in football - what else can I say ?Could use a few more concessions and restrooms, but I think those are coming.If I had a complaint it would be how they manage traffic on game day. Gig 'em !"
11474,Date of experience: January 2013,18-Jan-13,SEC,Texas,5,What an Experience!!,There are not words to describe the awesomeness of Kyle Field.  If you have the chance to stand down on the field it is a must.  Standing on the field you can just feel the honor and traditions of Aggieland all around.  You know then how amazing it must be to be a part of the 12th man.
11476,Date of experience: December 2012,28-Dec-12,SEC,Texas,4,Massive and Tall Football Stadium,"Didn't actually go inside the stadium, yet as we drove around the University and the football field, we noticed how incredibly tall it is.  Amazing engineering. Anyway, the Texas A&M campus is massive and well appointed.  It is so big it's better just to ride a bike around campus."
11477,Date of experience: November 2012,30-Nov-12,SEC,Texas,4,choose your seat carefully,For those that don't know the students stand during the football games. Cheap seats near midfield may be in the student section which means you will have to stand to see the game. The excitment of the crowd at a home game is unbeatable.
11478,Date of experience: October 2012,26-Nov-12,SEC,Texas,5,LSU vs Texas A&M,What a great place to tailgate! Everyone was friendly. Lots of space to hang out. Texans love to BBQ and drink beer. Welcome to the SEC!
11479,Date of experience: November 2012,26-Nov-12,SEC,Texas,5,Best Stadium in all of College Football!!!,Best experience. . . every time!  The stadium and the surrounding areas are beautiful.  It's a great venue and very family friendly!
11480,Date of experience: October 2012,12-Nov-12,SEC,Texas,5,Perfect place to see a college football game!,"There is no better place to watch college football than Kyle Field, home of the Texas A&M Aggies. This place is rich with tradition that echoes throughout the entire stadium. It really is one of the loudest stadiums in the country."
11485,Date of experience: September 2019,24-Sep-19,SEC,Vanderbilt,3,In for LSU Game,The stadium is nice and easy to get to.  Parking is cheap compared to other stadiums.  Only problem is that if you are in seats above row 40 its a hike to your seat and only one way up there.  Also concessions need more people working.  I guess they did not expect the crowds.
11486,Date of experience: September 2019,22-Sep-19,SEC,Vanderbilt,3,"Small venue, but offers great views; first visit (Vandy vs. LSU)","Access into the stadium was crisp and clean.  No issues experienced at all for entry.Getting through the tunnels into the stadium was a great challenge.  It took more than 15 minutes to get through the tunnel to the stands. Concession lines were very long and several places ran out of water - not good on a hot September game with an 11 a.m. kickoff.  The views from the seats were great.  Looked like the LSU fans greatly outnumbered the home standing Vandy fans.  Good replay screen.  It doesn't seat a lot - around 40k, but it made for a good game experience."
11487,Date of experience: September 2019,22-Sep-19,SEC,Vanderbilt,4,LSU/ Vanderbuilt,"We enjoyed a great game in an older stadium. This place is small and it showed, not enough bathrooms and the concessions were lacking. They ran out of the good beer before halftime leaving only natural light, bud light.But because it??s small the views were great. Just be prepared to wait for anything and everything here."
11488,Date of experience: September 2019,3-Sep-19,SEC,Vanderbilt,4,First Game!!! Go Dawgs!!,"As always a fun stadium to go to. Small compared to most SEC stadiums but still good seats everywhere. Restrooms not large enough for crowd. Concessions also a little limited. They do seem to be land locked and if there is a need to add on then the Home team needs to feel the seats, not the visiting teams. Love going though. And beautiful campus to walk through."
11489,Date of experience: August 2019,2-Sep-19,SEC,Vanderbilt,2,"Easy access to stadium, but it's just not up to par","We were in town for Georgia's opening game of the season.  Very nice campus and the location was great, less than a mile from our hotel and an easy walk to and from the stadium.  The Vanderbilt Athletic Department had posted information the week if the game about items that are allowed inside the stadium, and it included 16x16 seat cushions, so we took our cushions to the game. The security guard said no, we could not take our cushions in the stadium, although they were 16x16.  We tossed them behind a tree near the stadium and walked in to find a table with free 16x16 seat cushions with a Vanderbilt logo, so we grabbed a few.  The real problem was with the stadium itself - absolutely the least amount of seating room in any venue that I have ever visited, they ran out of food, and restroom facilities were inadequate for the number of people. It's time for Vandy to join the rest of the college football world."
11490,Date of experience: November 2018,26-Nov-18,SEC,Vanderbilt,4,First Time for me,"To attend a game at Vandy. We were there for the TN-Vandy game. Met some interesting people, Andy Ludwig Offensive Coordinator & sat by two generations of Pediatric doctors at Vanderbilt."
11491,Date of experience: October 2018,24-Oct-18,SEC,Vanderbilt,3,High school stadium,"My wife and I met other Gator grads in Nashville for the Florida - Vandy game.   While the actual Vandy campus was beautiful, we were totally underwhelmed by this stadium.  It was a slightly larger than a high school stadium.  On the positive side, I was able to buy tickets through the Vandy ticket office and get my pick of the seats and not far from the field.  The Vandy fans showed up slowly to the game arriving about the 3rd quarter.  The scoreboard was possibly the smallest that I have seen at a major college.  The sound system volume was so underwhelming; you could barely hear the announcer.  The bathrooms were okay but very small and the concessions were even slower and ran out of different concessions (maybe they didn't count on so many Florida fans showing up - the overall crowd was 55% Florida and 45% Vandy).  Overall, the Florida come-back win was exciting but the stadium was so-so."
11496,Date of experience: November 2017,2-Apr-18,SEC,Vanderbilt,4,Great place to see a game!,"We had a blast watching a game here! When in Nashville I would definitely recommend this (especially because if you??re out of town you can root for either team!) Maybe we didn??t read our tickets closely enough, but be aware: NO BAGS ARE ALLOWED we were turned away but managed to store them in the hotel next door and got them back safe and sound at the end of the night."
11497,Date of experience: October 2017,11-Oct-17,SEC,Vanderbilt,4,Go Dawgs!,Super easy place to get in and out of compared to the bigger stadiums.  Great sight lines and the seats are very close to the field.  Had a great experience taking our kids.  The Vandy fans and workers were all very hospitable.  Will be back.
11498,Date of experience: September 2017,24-Sep-17,SEC,Vanderbilt,4,Roll Tide!,Vanderbilt Stadium is a great place to see a game.  Easy to find a parking spot.  Food trucks available near Gate 2.  Warning:  bathrooms are small.  Go early to beat the rush.
11499,Date of experience: October 2016,27-Jul-17,SEC,Vanderbilt,4,"Nice stadium, expect more visiting fans","Quite liked the stadium set by the campus, does not attract much local interest and expect crowd to be made up mainly of visitors , decent atmosphere but not an intense or avid one, facilities are fair"
11515,Date of experience: November 2016,27-Jan-17,SEC,Vanderbilt,5,Vanderbilt Stadium,Had a fantastic time at the Vandy vs UT game. The stadium was well taken care of and the concessions and gift shops had a great selection. Look forward to going to another game in 2017!
